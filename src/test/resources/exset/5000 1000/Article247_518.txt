                                 Marcia Mellows                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with the grand jury appearance ofMonica's mom. But to the New YorkTimes and Los Angeles Times there's something much sexier than thepresidential love Jones--the Dow Jones. The NYT lead reports thatAmerican households have more of their fortunes invested in the stock marketthan at any time in the last 50 years, and maybe ever.                           USAT reports that Marcia Lewis (nee Lewinsky) is due back in thegrand jury room today after being compelled to answer questions yesterday abouther daughter's relationship with President Clinton. The paper reports thataccording to some people in the know, Lewis was "aware of a relationshipbetween Lewinsky and the president." Also, that Lewis was aware her daughterwas "infatuated" with Clinton. Lewinsky is scheduled to appear before the samegrand jury later this week. And the dailies all quote her lawyer's comment thatshe will testify if his attempts to quash the grand jury subpoena areunsuccessful. "She has," says William Ginsburg, "no intention of falling on hersword." Note to Ginsburg: ixnay on the sword metaphors.            The WP adds that Lewis was privy to Lewinsky's taped account of herrelationship with Clinton, and that her reaction to her daughter's attempt toconceal it from outsiders was, "What's the big deal? So she lied and convincedsomeone else to lie." The paper effortlessly ticks off several of the scandal'sother new poontangents: a federal judge's denial of Clinton's request for aspeed-up of the Paula Jones case, another federal judge's allowing KennethStarr to get his hands on a sealed deposition made by the allegedlylipstick-smeared and disheveled Oval Office visitor Kathleen Willey, and theturn-over to Starr of boxes of Jones case materials about yet other womenthought linked to Clinton.            But the Post goes a bit overboard with 120-plus words on an allegedconversation between Lewis and Lewinsky's former White House supervisor thatreveal nothing about the conversation except that it lasted less than fiveminutes and was not confrontational. The NYT does a little better,saying the discussion was Mom's inquiry into why Monica was transferred out ofthe White House. The Post blind-sources this episode, while theNYT credits it by name to Lewis' fianc,.            None of the papers' accounts addresses a natural question: If spouses can'tbe compelled to testify against each other, how come a mother (especially onewho's apparently her child's "closest confidante") can be compelled to testifyagainst a daughter? Why, in the law, is water thicker than blood?            The Wall Street Journal recently caught a lot of hell for itsultimately retracted story that a White House steward had told the Starr grandjury the president had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky. Well, on today's WPfront, a retired Secret Service agent is saying the same thing.            The possible Iraq attack takes a number and waits. Yes, it gets the off-leadat USAT and a spot on the NYT front. However, at the WP , theSecretary of Defense's various burnoose conferences slip to page 23. But"Titanic"'s 14 Oscar nominations are front page at the Post andLAT .            The WSJ reports that, thus far, CBS' Winter Olympic ratings are about17 percent below what was promised to advertisers, raising the prospect ofexpensive givebacks to them.            An FOTP sends along this AP dispatch from that ex-midshipwomen's murdertrial: "On Monday, jurors in the trial appeared bored or puzzled by the defenseteam's tactic of presenting a number of witnesses." Hmmm.what were theyexpecting?            The NYT scrupulously corrects a prior misstatement of the wordsmaking up the acronym of the James Bond nemesis organization "SPECTRE." Whichis particularly odd given the frequency with which Times readers areleft seriously confused about many of the paper's more significant allegedredemptions and original sins. Here's a tip, though: "failure to attributephrasing" means "plagiarism."
