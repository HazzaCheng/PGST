                                 <P><SPAN class=760110315-12101999>Mark Sikorski</SPAN></P>            Captain's log: 2100 hours, underway in the SouthAtlantic Ocean. Forward is heaving hypnotically to the gentle oceanswells as we glide beneath a canopy of brilliant points of starlight. Theevening watches are set--on the bridge, combat information center, engineeringcontrol center, and communications room; the smell of fresh pastries from thegalley is wafting throughout the ship. Most of the crew of 90 men and womenhave settled in for the evening, taking advantage of a well-deserved lull inactivity. We are steaming northeast off the coast of Uruguay in position 35degrees south latitude and 54 degrees west longitude, which is about 2,100miles south of the equator. It has been three months and nearly 13,000 miles ofocean since we've seen our homeport of Portsmouth, Va.; it's hard to believeour families are still in another hemisphere.            While not always thrilling, shipboard life uniquelyblends tradition and customs with modern technology and comforts. For example,as the captain, I enjoy many of the perks traditionally offered in the earlydays of sail. I have my own cabin (which is the largest stateroom in the ship),I'm saluted as I walk on and off the bridge, and when I speak, people listen.Flogging, I think, has been left off the modern perk list! In simple terms, thebuck stops with me. All actions and decisions are my responsibility--even if Ididn't make them. While my authority is absolute, so is my accountability; 90lives depend on it. I can't think of too many job descriptions that carrysimilar weight. I love my job, not because of personal gain, but for thepersonal growth I see in my shipmates and for the service we provide ourcountry. I relayed a story to the crew one evening: We were traveling down theRio de la Plata River from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Montevideo, Uruguay; theriver has a fairly narrow channel that required a navigational pilot to assistus during the nine-hour transit. After a few short hours on the bridge, theriver pilot told me that I had a very well run and professional crew; he wenton to say that is why "America is the No. 1 country in the world." You can'tget much better than that.            In the fast-paced, Internet-woven world we live in,it's nice to take refuge in the simple aspects of being a sailor. I enjoy mymorning workouts on the stationary bike in our helicopter hangar--oceansunrises are as close to heaven on earth as you can get. I like to see thegleam in the eye of a young officer when she handles the ship well alongsidethe pier; mastering the effects of wind, tide, and current. I tell my wardroomof 13 officers to eat "three squares" a day--mealtime has always been animportant aspect of shipboard life, more for its social aspects than anythingelse. Plus, I have many of them convinced that my sunny disposition is due to awell-fed stomach. I still get chills when my most junior crewmembers snap sharpsalutes when I approach them on the bridge. I can sense they are happy toserve; America is truly blessed with the young Coast Guard men and women I havethe pleasure to serve with.            Let me set the record straight before I leave youwith the illusion that life aboard a Coast Guard cutter is one step removedfrom a cruise liner. A typical day underway is consumed with eight hours ofwatches and eight hours of ship's work. There are boats to launch, helicoptersto land, training to conduct and guns to shoot. Throw in your three squares andyou've got an hour and change of free time. This ship is alive 24 by 7. Whenthe weather kicks up, fatigue accelerates tenfold: Your bones ache; stuff fliesloose; keeping a steady footing is hard work; sleep is nearly impossible. Andyet we persevere; it becomes personal--to weather a storm is one of theultimate challenges of the sea; to see it calm from its fury is like emergingfrom the dark side of the moon; euphoric moods erupt only to be outdone by theeuphoria of returning home.
