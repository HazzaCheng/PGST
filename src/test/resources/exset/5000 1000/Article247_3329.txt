                                 Day Trading Is for Suckers                        In the wake of last week's shootings at two day trading firms in Atlanta, aspokesman for one of the companies said that these firms did a good job ofwarning prospective clients of the risks day trading entails and added that ifclients followed the rules the company laid out, day trading was both easy andprofitable. Now, easy it may be, although spending six and a half hours staringat a computer screen isn't my idea of fun. (Which makes you wonder why I'm awriter.) But profitable day trading certainly isn't, and the current mania forit is less a reflection of the moneymaking opportunities it offers than of theallure of easy credit and the seemingly unstoppable conviction of all gamblersthat the house can be beaten.            The numbers are by this point well known, but they're no less staggering forall that. Most estimates suggest that 80 to 90 percent of all day traders losemoney. And that's in absolute terms: These people leave their day tradingcareers with less money than they had when they started. Those statistics saynothing about how many day traders lose money in relative terms, which is tosay underperform the S&P 500. (If you do worse than an index fund, you'reeffectively losing money, because you can invest in an index fund with no laboror opportunity cost at all.) It's probably safe to say that less than 5 percentof day traders are successful, even without considering the opportunity cost ofall the time and energy they have to put into their trading.            This is not, needless to say, surprising. Day trading is predicated on afundamental misconception about the nature of stock prices, namely that theyare somehow persistent and predictable. Now, some interesting academic studiesin recent years have called into question the idea that stock prices move onlyin a pure random walk (i.e., they're as likely to go up as go down at any onemoment). But the walk is effectively random, in the sense that patterns areincredibly hard to discern and basically impossible to take advantage of withany regularity. In order to succeed as a day trader over time, you have to beone thing: incredibly lucky.            The media sort of gets this. But the attacks on day trading have gotten toomixed up with concerns about the impact of online brokerages, the rise ofindividual investing, and the mania for Net stocks. These are distinctphenomena, and have nothing to do with what's wrong with day trading. In thelong run, the impact of day trading on stock prices is negligible, and althoughthe rise of the Net has facilitated day trading, in fact day trading as it'sdone at firms such as All-Tech and Momentum looks more like old investing thannew investing, in this sense: The people who profit from day trading are notthe day traders, but the firms that reap huge commissions from all the trading,just as old-line brokers tended to encourage people to trade to increase churnin their accounts and boost commissions.            The thing that is most remarkable about day trading, though, is the almostcomplete absence of a coherent investment theory that could justify thepractice. If you read Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch or John Burr Williams, youget a clear sense of the principles that guide their investing. But if you talkto day traders and try to figure out why they believe they can beat the market,you don't get any real ideas. You just get a host of anecdotes about greattrades. The press has exacerbated this problem by including in every articleabout day trading at least one character who says he's made hundreds ofthousands of dollars. How he did it and why he doesn't get up from the tableand walk away always remain unexplained. Let's face it. If you go into anycasino, there's going to be someone there who's up many thousands of dollars.That may help us understand why people keep gambling. It doesn't help explainwhat gambling really means economically.            Finally, it's crucial to remember that day traders have the dubiousadvantage of playing with the house's money, since most firms will lend them upto 50 percent of their existing capital to buy more stocks with. That has twoconsequences: It increases risk, and it makes day traders' performance evenless impressive. If you're wagering 150 percent as much money as you have, theprofits when you succeed will be greater than otherwise. But so will be yourlosses. What day traders need to ask themselves is: If I had put 150 percent ofmy money in an index fund, what would my returns have been? But if they couldask themselves that question, they wouldn't be day traders.
