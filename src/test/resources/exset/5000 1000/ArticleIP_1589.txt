                                 For Better or for Worse            In one of Bob Dole's worsthours, his wife Elizabeth follows her brilliant performance at the RepublicanConvention with a warm, well-filmed 30-second appeal on his behalf. The spot,called Elizabeth , was produced by Alex Castellanos. He's Jesse Helms'ex-media man, and this ad proves that his style surely does change with hisclient. Normally, a spouse's endorsement spot doesn't do much beyond making acandidate feel good. If your wife or husband isn't for you, who is? ButElizabeth Dole's poll ratings and communication skills decisively exceed herhusband's. In fact, Republican pollster Frank Luntz reports that his focusgroups of voters show that the convention bounce was for Elizabeth, not BobDole.            Visually, the spot createsthe sense of a one-on-one conversation between each viewer and the appealingwoman in the soft yellow suit who's sitting casually in what appears to be herliving room. The smooth, slow camera movement through the spot imparts a degreeof visual variety without disturbing the intimate mood. The surface simplicityof the scene belies the sheer weight of the spot's message. Elizabethattempts to make three separate points, all of them critical to the Dolecampaign.            The would-be first ladyfirst vouches for her husband's integrity--and by implication, points to thecontrast with Bill Clinton. The spot is intentionally ladylike, a positiveoasis in a desert of attack ads on both sides. But it, too, is intended to benegative: phrases like "doing what's right" and "living up to his word" playoff much-surveyed voter doubts about the president's character.                           Elizabeth next triesto deal with one of Dole's central political weaknesses, a gender gap thatleaves him as much as 25 or 30 points behind among women. So this woman,successful in her own right, and except for her politics a poster woman for the"Ms. Generation," tells us that her "husband" has strong commitments ondomestic violence and equal retirement benefits for women.            But the spot doesn't lingerhere. It moves swiftly and smoothly to Dole's most fundamental problem, hisloss of credibility on the tax issue. In part because his campaign ads dealt indrugs and character in the weeks after the Republican Convention, votersincreasingly bought into the Democratic definitions of the 15 percent taxcut--that it's probably phony, and almost certainly wouldn't happen even ifDole got elected. Elizabeth reminds us that Bob Dole does what he does"because it's right"--another JFK line, straight out of the inaugural address.Here, the line tweaks our now-collective memory of Dole's war service andsuggests that he wouldn't propose the tax cut simply because it was easy orpolitic. "You can count on it," we hear straight from Elizabeth, "because it'sright for America's families."            Does this really reassureus? It helps. After all, would this lady lie to us? And we know she's too smartto be fooled. Just for insurance, she returns to the implicit comparison withClinton: "Bob Dole doesn't make promises he can't keep." Elizabethargues that we can trust Dole more--or at least distrust him less. Thesharpness of the message woven through the softness of the image recalls CarlSandburg's description of someone as "a steel fist in a velvet glove."            This spotconcludes with footage of the empty Kansas prairie, the place Bob Dole comesfrom, where, as he said in his acceptance speech, a man is very small againstthe sky. Dole, the picture says again, is from the heartland, the land of plainvirtue and truth-telling. The empty sky here leaves room for the words he wantspeople to decide are true: "Bob Dole will cut our taxes." This last scene iscuriously disconnected from the preceding conversation with our friend"Elizabeth." Despite the ad-maker's intention, the viewer may decide that thewinding two-lane road of the scene leads only to Dole's bridge to the past. Butwhatever the outcome, the spot artfully--and literally--puts the best face on atough sale.            --RobertShrum
