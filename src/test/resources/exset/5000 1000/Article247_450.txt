                                 Let's MIG a Deal            Election '97 leads at USA Today , and the major local races lead at the New York Timesand the Washington Post . The Los AngelesTimes leads with a Supreme Court decision that could lead to cheaperconsumer goods. The political races that get most of the ink are RudolfGiuliani's big win in New York City and Governor Christie Todd Whitman's closecall in New Jersey. USAT describes Whitman as "once considered a futurepresidential candidate"--an odd appellation since pulling out a second termover a strong challenger would seem to enhance her prospects. The paper saysGiuliani was being rewarded for presiding over his city's 44 percent crimedrop.            The WP 's top national story is that President Clinton's nomination ofBill Lann Lee to the Department of Justice's top civil rights job is in badshape. Senate Republican leaders are feeling their oats over yesterday'sSupreme Court decision letting Proposition 209 stand and are suggesting thatLee and any other future nominees to the post will face a tough new standard onaffirmative action.            The NYT 's top national story is what it calls "one of the mostimportant antitrust decisions in years," the Supreme Court's unanimous rulingon Tuesday that a manufacturer or supplier does not automatically violateantitrust statutes by placing a ceiling on the retail price that may be chargedfor its products. The paper, which filed a brief in the case supporting pricecaps, notes that it's widely believed the decision will lead to lower consumerprices.            The LAT lead story on this decision includes the provenance of acommon ad phrase: "offer good at participating stores only." Prior toyesterday, the paper explains, this rider was required because independentsellers could not be forced to charge the price in question. USAT alsocarries the price cap story on its front, while the Wall Street Journal includes it in its front-page businessand finance news box. But the WP doesn't get to it until p. 9 of itsbusiness section.            Although the Iraq inspection crisis hasn't really changed that much, thepapers, never really that engaged, have dropped it down a couple of notches.The story is featured in the WSJ 's "world-wide" news box, and it's abovethe fold of the LAT front. But it's below the fold at USAT and onp. A6 at the NYT and p. A29 at the WP .            The NYT runs a top-front story about "a novel tack" the U.S. has justused to keep some advanced Soviet-era fighters out of the hands of Iran--buyingthem first. It seems the U.S. recently bought 21 MIG-29 jet fighters--fourteenof them capable of carrying nuclear missiles--from the former Soviet Republicof Moldova out of the fear that they would otherwise end up in Iran'spossession. (The Air Force will study and fly the aircraft, the DOD says.)Defense department officials wouldn't say what the purchase price was, but,says the Times , the U.S. put up not just money but also food andsupplies. The WP story on the deal reports that the cash put up was lessthan $50 million. Both papers note that the purchase funds came from a "threatreduction" program established to help dismantle the Soviet arsenal.            The latest circulation audit shows that nine of the nation's fifteen largestnewspapers recorded an increase in daily circulation, reports the WP .And nearly two-thirds of all papers with circulations over 200,000 recordedgains. Sunday papers aren't doing so well, though.            Did you know that the IRS allows some of its employees to use pseudonymswhen dealing with the public? So says the WSJ "Tax Report," which statesthat Internal Revenue says these are only allowed for agents who fear beingharassed, threatened or assaulted by taxpayers. There are currently 350pseudonyms in use at the agency.            Back to those MIGS for a minute: Note that our "threat reduction" moneyisn't being used to buy back similarly capable aircraft, such as the F-15s inthe inventories of such combustible countries as Pakistan and Turkey. That'sbecause those planes were made and sold for a nice piece of change byus.
