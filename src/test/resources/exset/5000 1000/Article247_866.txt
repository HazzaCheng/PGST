                                 Spring Breakdown            The whimper-not-a-bang end for now at the Kosovo talks leads at the Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes . USA Today puts the talks on page 9 and instead leads withthe guilty verdict in the race-tinged dragging murder case in Jasper, Texas.The New York Times ,which off-leads the Kosovo talks and fronts the murder conviction, goes withthe Senate's imminent reevaluation of the independent counsel statute, which,the paper says, will probably either not be renewed at all or will besubstantially revised, primarily because of widespread dissatisfaction with theway the law worked in the Kenneth Starr investigation of President Clinton. TheWP runs a similar piece inside. USAT 's news section "cover story"on the statute is more categorical, saying flatly, "there is virtually nochance that a scandal-weary Congress" will renew it.            Rashomon reporting reigns supreme in the papers' coverage of the Kosovotalks. The talks ended with nothing signed, no peacekeeping forces in place,and no NATO airstrikes. Instead, there was the surprise quartum quid of theAlbanian negotiators saying they "understood and accepted" the profferedWestern peace plan but would take a few weeks off to check in with the homefolks before signing anything. The WP sees this as a "major setback" forU.S. and European leaders and drives home the tenuousness of the situation bynoting renewed Albanian vs. Serb fighting and passing along U.S. intelligencereports of Yugoslav troop movements "in apparent preparation for a large-scaleoffensive." Somehow though, the NYT goes with the glass-half-fullheadline, "Kosovo Albanians, in Reversal, Say They Will Sign Peace Pact," andcalls the outcome a "limited success." But even within such a cheery take, thepaper has to admit that it will be difficult in the interim for NATO tointimidate or contain Slobodan Milosevic's forces. The LAT sees a"piecemeal success," but does point out that the result is very close to whatonly a few days ago Madeleine Albright called "a worthless piece of paper."(Actually, the LAT informs, the non-result is on 81 pieces of paper.)The LAT further brings out the day's non-accomplishments by noting thatthus far, the Serbs have refused to even discuss military and police issues.Only the Wall Street Journal points out high and clear that theAlbanians' promise to sign would quickly evaporate if they meet with stronginternal criticism before the talks reconvene.                           USAT reports that white supremacist John William King was convictedof capital murder in Jasper in less than 2 hours and that the jury immediatelyplunged into the case's penalty phase, which could result in a death sentence.Two other white men are awaiting trials for their alleged part in the grislymurder of a 49-year-old black man. The LAT 's coverage of the caseincludes some good detail on courtroom spin: King appeared in court with hishair grown out so as to cover the pentagram tattooed on his skull and in aturtleneck shielding the Nazi SS symbols on his body. The WP reportsthat King's father offered his condolences to the dead man's family.            Contemporary reporting has a hard time lighting on a topic unless it canfind a way to make it into a political story, preferably one about apersonality conflict. Witness the story about competing African trade billsinside the WP . One bill was devised by Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. and theother by Rep. Charles Rangel. So naturally, the Post waits until theninth paragraph of a fourteen paragraph story to say what the two bills are andhow they differ, and none too clearly at that. Far more important apparently,is taking up the top of the piece with the back and forth sniping between thetwo bill sponsors.            Both the NYT and WP report that tonight, NBC will broadcastits long-held interview with Juanita Broaddrick, who claims that in 1978 BillClinton, while Arkansas Attorney General, raped her. The Times , whichhas not previously covered the story per se, weighs in with a lengthy accountof its halting path thus far. The paper includes this interesting detail, which drives home the unusual course theBroaddrick story took getting to the WSJ op-ed page: Alan Murray, theJournal 's Washington bureau chief, says he first found out about hispaper's article by reading about it on Matt Drudge's web site.
