Randy'sWrap-Up                        The daily coverage ofKosovo, Microsoft, and Rudolph Giuliani teaches this lesson: It's futile toread the newspaper. Salient details are always concealed, key decisions arealways made in private, and the ink gets all over your hands. Review thedailies from 1942 or 1929 or 1863, and you'll come away with a similarimpressively false sense of the great events of the day. So why persist innewspaper reading? For one thing, it lets you participate in the ongoingconversation that is a nation's culture. One doesn't wish to stand silently bywhile others merrily exchange misinformation about Albania, the NYPD, andcomputer viruses. (That's why millions of decent Americans watch Just ShootMe : It'll be the talk of the schoolyard tomorrow. Surely not because it is,in any meaningful sense, good.) For another thing, the news provides a mythsystem for a secular age, giving us figures of good and evil, around whom wecan construct tales of ... well, OK, figures of evil and more evil. But perhapsthe utility of newspapers--their ability to provide truth and understanding--isbeside the point. One buys them for other reasons: for powerful photographs,now often in color, of underwear models; for a chance encounter with anembarrassing detail about Ron Perelman; and perhaps most of all, for thatlovable Marmaduke cartoon. At 60 cents, it's a bargain!                           SquirreliciousAnswer                        "A letter in which Beatrix Potter reveals that oneof her best-loved fictional creations, Squirrel Nutkin, was based on a petsquirrel with behavioural problems is expected to fetch up to 15,000 atauction," reports Kathy Marks.            Writing in 1903, six months before the publicationof The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin , Potter notes: "I bought two squirrels,but the one called Nutkin--who was much the handsomest--was so very savage Iwas obliged to take him back to the shop. So I have only one now, calledTwinkleberry."            Rosemary Franklin, theletter's owner, learned its value when she took it to BBC Television'sAntiques Roadshow .
