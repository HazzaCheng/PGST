                                 Gore's Hypocrisy; the Punditocracy                        ELLEN:            You lost me on your techno explanation, but my thanks for trying. In youropinion, what exactly is the "counterculture" today? If it's FatboySlim, and the others, and confined to that, I don't see the counterculture.Where does today's youth stand on politics, for example? Besides thecommunications breakthrough, what's today's equivalent of the sexualrevolution, the feminist movement, etc.? Besides the tattoos and piercings,which are pretty standard, I don't see much that separates today's 25-year-oldfrom today's 45-year-old. Please inform me, with a touch less of GreilMarcus.            I love e-mail too. It's so much more convenient than the phone, when you'renot sure if someone's in and you trade voice mail. Also, in reporting, if yoursubject is willing, you can reproduce exactly what they've said, onrecord, so there's no dispute on misquotes. Although when I was sifting throughsome storage at Moishe's in Long Island City last week, I came across a trunkfull of letters from college and high-school days. It's a cliche, butwhen was the last time you got a real letter? I know I never write themanymore. They're relics now, and will make for fascinating reading in futuregenerations.            On Page 12 of today's New York Post there's a priceless photo of RudyGiuliani at Saratoga. He's wearing shades, with a too-wide tie, grinning, witha flack by his side, looking for all the world like a don out of the openingscene in Godfather II , when Michael Corleone coughs up some dough forthe state of Nevada and then has that immortal conversation with the shadysenator.            I don't agree with your point yesterday that Gore himself is messing up hiscampaign. Yes, he's made a lot of dumb moves and gaffes and is spending moneylike Steve Forbes. And hiring Carter Eskew was positively Clintonian: Aftermoving all those union delegates to tears with his speech about his sister in'96, it was an unbelievably hypocritical hire. But Clinton clearly doesn't wantto leave office, and he's done his best to (I'm being charitable here)subconsciously sabotage his loyal soldier's campaign. Hillary herself isfucking (figuratively, I assume) Gore, too. She'd be a far better asset beingon the stump for him and other Senate candidates, rather than sucking up money,media attention, and organizational skills for herself. It was Hillary who wasresponsible for re-electing Barbara Boxer last year; a plus for you, I'm sure,a nightmare for me.            I love your idea of combining the Kinsleys of the world into oneawful outlet for conventional Beltway wisdom. It would save so much time. Anexample is here in New York: For months, the pundits, Democratic-leaning ofcourse, predicted that Rick Lazio would run for Senate, thus bloodying Rudy forhis slugfest with Hillary. That was stupid thinking. I don't care about theD'Amato/Pataki feud with Rudy; there was simply no way they'd resist thepressure from the Bush organization to unite behind the mayor. With a unitedGOP party in New York, Gore/Bradley is going to actually have to spend time inthe state (same in California) instead of thinking of it as a gimme state.            I read Dick Morris' column in the Post today, and as usual he hadsome good points. He wrote that Bush is lucky to have Forbes as his chiefopponent, because the publishing scion is too dorky to win, an assessment Iagree with, although I'm a fan of his economic platform (although his panderingto Christians is just shameless). The problem with Morris is that you can'tbelieve a word he says.            I also read today that the Voice will unveil a new design tomorrow.If editor Don Forst was smart, he'd unveil new content as well. But I'll get tothat tomorrow. I'll be curious about your Voice nostalgia. One morequestion: What are your three favorite magazines? I'm sure you'll be horrified,but mine are the Weekly Standard , Vanity Fair , and The NewYorker .            Best,RUSS
