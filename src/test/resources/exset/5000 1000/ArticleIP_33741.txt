                                 Living the Greek Way                           Rush toJudgment                        All this sororitybashing is getting so old (see the "," by Alison Spurgeon, sororitysister). Ironically, those who spout off the most about Greek life andconformity are just as guilty of it. Do people who are covered with piercingsand tattoos really believe they are expressing their individuality? They arejust as conformist; humans naturally gravitate toward groups and chances tobelong to a larger whole.            Having been in asorority and then working in government, nonprofits, and the corporate world, Ifind that Greek life was very representative of the "real world." Every househas idiots, sluts, social climbers, and alcoholics. Every house also hasgeniuses, philanthropists, and varying kinds of campus leaders. There arebrown-nosing and backstabbing and viciousness. There are also kindness andloyalty and real bonds that are developed between people. For someone like me,who hadn't had very many close friendships with women, it was a trulybeneficial experience, even if I hated a lot of what went on.            -- MichelleHonald                        Denver                           Leave It,Levitt                        Steven Levitt is being extremely disingenuous whenhe claims that he takes no position on the public policy implications of hisresearch (""). Obviously crime is a bad thing, so if your research indicates acorrelation between a social practice--abortion--and a reduction in crime, youare at a minimum implicitly advocating that practice with the minimum of legalrestrictions.            Your analogy to global warming research points upthe deceit. The impetus for research on global warming has come from those whobelieve that fossil fuel consumption is out of control and who reinforce theirbeliefs with global warming research, given everyone's understanding that majorman-made climatic change is a bad thing. No one is out there advocating globalwarming. Maybe your research is right, maybe it is wrong, but you undermineyour credibility when you claim to be oblivious to its implications. You had tohave a thesis going in when you started your research, and given that wealready knew crime rates were falling, it is hard to believe you weren'tlooking for a correlation between abortion and falling crime rates. Life is tooshort to use one's career wandering in the dark, and no one is going to believethat's what you did.            By all means, fight backon the eugenics attacks. That's below the belt. I think it is perfectlyrespectable for you to use your results to say that all those who have beenpointing to overall demographic shifts, or changing police tactics, orincreasing incarceration rates are missing a key factor. But you are justwaving a red flag to a bull when you cast attacks on others for supposedlymisreading you altogether.            -- Ken O'Brien                        LosAngeles                           Malleable Lamar                        Lamar Alexander's campaign never got off the groundbecause the American people can recognize a phony (""). Alexander can and willmold himself into anything. As Bush's secretary of education he was for"Break-the-Mold" schools. Earlier he had favored comprehensive schools. Nowthat people have turned against large government interventions, he wants tomake every school a "charter school" with power vested in the parents andteachers. He says this will make our system the best. When Linda Wertheimerasked him, "How would we know?" there was a moment of glorious dead air.            Michael Lewis,interviewed about his book Trail Fever , observed that Alexander "didsomething I didn't think possible in this campaign. He proved you could be toophony. This is why Clinton feared him most of all the candidates. He was somalleable. He even looks a little like putty."            -- Gerald W.Bracey                        Alexandria, Va.
