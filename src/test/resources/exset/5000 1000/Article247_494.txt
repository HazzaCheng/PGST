                                 Message: Wee Care            Everybody's big story is the inability of the Terry Nichols jury to decideon his sentence, which under the federal rules, means he won't get the deathpenalty. The judge will decide instead and the dailies say that he'll probablygo for life in prison. Nichols, the reader is reminded all around, still faceshundreds of state murder charges that could result in the death penalty.            The most striking part of this installment of the Nichols story is whatUSAToday calls the "sharply critical press conference" held by the juryforewoman afterwards. She is quoted as saying that "the government dropped theball." USAT implies that what she meant by this was that "it was hard tosay from the evidence presented exactly what Terry Nichols' involvement was."But the New York Times ,Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes say the "dropping the ball" comment was about her belief that thegovernment had failed to search for other suspects            The WP seems to reveal that this juror ended up with at least a touchof militia-style animus against the feds when it quotes herremark: "I think the government's attitude.is part of where all this comes fromin the first place..I think maybe it's time the government be morerespectful.and not with the attitude that we know and you don't, we have thepower and you don't." Indeed, in its lead paragraph, the LAT attributesthe sentencing outcome to a belief by many jurors that the FBI was arrogant andsloppy.            Continuing the time-honored tradition of drip-dripping the key elements ofthe upcoming State of the Union speech ahead of time, all of the front pagescover President Clinton's proposal of a nearly $22 billion package of grantsand tax breaks to help working families pay for child care. The plan would alsoinclude tax credits for businesses that build or expand employee child carefacilities. Congressional rumblings are noted--both USAT and theNYT report that House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer referred tothe plan as another of Clinton's "small ideas" that "taken together, return tothe era of big government"--but there is no mention of the federally subsidizedstate-of-the-art workplace child-care center used by members of Congress.            The news that the Department of Justice has brought its first criminalcharges in its investigation of the tobacco industry makes the fronts ofthe LAT , the WP , and USAT , and is flagged in thefront-page news box of the Wall Street Journal . The NYT carries it inside. Thefeds say that DNA Plant Technology Corp. conspired with a tobacco company(officially unnamed, but widely reported to be Brown and Williamson) to developa high-nicotine tobacco. DNA has agreed to cooperate with the DOJ's ongoinginvestigation. The USAT headline--"Biotech Firm to Aid TobaccoProbe"--makes the whole thing sound like good citizenship rather than a pleabargain.            The NYT front-page story about the Paula Jones lawsuit starts rightoff stating that Jones plans to be physically present when Bill Clinton isquestioned under oath by her lawyers at an upcoming deposition. But the piecewaits until the tenth paragraph to note that this was reported yesterday in theWashington Times . (This story is also inside today's Post .)            The WP runs an op-ed complaining that the U.S. is single-handedlyresisting a U.N. attempt to reduce the worldwide use of child soldiers. (Morethan a quarter-million children are currently serving under arms, the piecesays.) It seems we are balking at accepting age 18 as the cut-off because thePentagon allows 17-year-olds to enlist with parental consent. But, counters theop-ed, nearly all these soldiers reach 18 before being assigned to combatpositions.            In his column today, William Safire goes off on an extended rant against allthe ways in which privacy is imperiled, from your dealings with banks andemployers and stores, to airline security and deadbeat dad tracking. It'sgratifying to see that some twenty-five years after leaving the Enemies ListWhite House, Safire has come to appreciate the awesome dangers of informationtrafficking, but it's interesting that his proposed reforms still smack of theNixon M.O.: "Sign as little as possible" and "Above all--pay cash."
