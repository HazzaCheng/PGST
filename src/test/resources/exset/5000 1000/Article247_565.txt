                                 Saddam But True            The New York Timesleads with a story nobody else is paying much attention to right now--thecontinued Iraqi failure to provide U.N. weapons inspectors with adequateinformation. USA Today leads with Ken Starr's and Paula Jones' decisionsto press on. The Washington Post goes with a story that the NYT got out infront on yesterday: the death of Pol Pot. The Los AngelesTimes leads with news that must strike terror deep within the hearts ofits readership: the state's second largest phone company, GTE, mistakenlyleased tens of thousands of unlisted phone numbers to telemarketers.            The Times lead is spurred by the latest report from the U.N.chief arms inspector to Kofi Annan concluding that Iraq is no closer now tomeeting U.N. requirements for the lifting of sanctions than it was last fall,when Saddam Hussein went to the brink to prevent further arms inspections. Thepaper sees a further ominous sign in Thursday's new outburst of Iraqidefiance--a call by the highest levels of the Iraqi government for theimmediate lifting of all embargoes.            The NYT has some choice tidbits from that as-yet unpublished U.N.report (and from others as well). Apparently, inspectors found some of thebuildings on their list to have been stripped of all equipment and evenfurniture. Indeed, none of the sites visited outside of Baghdad had eitherdocuments or computers. And some inspectors were stunned by the opulence of thepresidential palaces. Some rooms in them must have, according to some on theU.N. team, cost millions of dollars to furnish.            The Post reports that Pol Pot died quietly on a flowered mattress. The story goeson to describe televised footage of the death scene: Pot's body stretched outon a bed, plastic sandals at his bedside. Or you could turn to the NYTtop front, which has a large color shot of just this scene. The WPquotes journalist Nate Thayer, who recently did the first interview with Pot in18 years, saying he had no doubt that the man on the mattress was Pol Pot anddead.            The emotional scars left by Pol Pot's terror reign are crystallized in aremark made by a "Killing Fields" survivor, quoted by both the WP andNYT : "If he's dead, hand over his body to the people....I want to seehim handcuffed and pushed into a jail, like his cadres did to me 20 yearsago."            Both the Post and Times note that the U.S. is taking theposition that Pol Pot's death should not end efforts to bring to justice otherKhmer Rouge leaders implicated in the Cambodian slaughter. The WP leadeditorial states that eight to ten members of Pot's extermination committee arestill at large, and the NYT lead editorial says that the current head ofCambodia, Hun Sen, is also a henchmen.            The WP reports that the Republican National Committee's reaction toAl Gore's disclosure of his tax return the other day was to label him "VicePresident Scrooge" for donating just $353 to charity last year out of his incomeof $197,729.            The Wall Street Journal reports that in the months leading upto recent Judiciary Committee hearings on Microsoft, the Senate Democratscampaign organization was given $200,000 worth of free software by competitorOracle.            The NYT picks up today on a story first reported by the SouthChina Morning Post : Apple Computer, in bringing to Hong Kong its "ThinkDifferent" ads featuring pictures of famous independent movers and shakers, hasdecided to drop the Dalai Lama's portrait from the campaign. Thecompany at first tried to claim that this was because the Tibetan leader's faceis not well-known in the region--until confronted with the information thatpolls show 80 percent of Hong Kong residents are familiar with him. Now theline is, "In China, he may not get across the message that Apple is trying tosend." True, since apparently the message is money-grubbing phonyindividualism.            The NYT and LAT fronts report that a Vanderbilt Universitystudy, to be published today in Science , indicates that blacks are far less likely than whites to make use of theInternet. The racial divide is particularly pronounced on the lower end ofthe economic scale. Among households making less than $40,000 a year, whiteswere six times as likely as blacks to have used the Web. By the way, theLAT story cannot just refer to the "World Wide Web"--oh no, it has toexplain that this is "a popular Internet graphical network, encompassing some62 million Americans, that is revolutionizing business and education." Nowthink about this--if a reader doesn't know what the Web is, would he know whatthe Internet is, or what a graphical network is?
