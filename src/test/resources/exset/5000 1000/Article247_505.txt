                                 Starr Dreck            "This is going to be the biggest story in my lifetime," is the way JamesCarville put it, and it leads everywhere, eclipsing such leaders-any-other-dayas the Pope celebrating Mass in Cuba, a surprise guilty plea in the Unabombercase, and the decision by Microsoft to give in on the issue of Windows95/Internet Explorer separation.                           USAToday says that while papering Washington and elsewhere with subpoenas,Kenneth Starr was working to persuade Monica Lewinsky to testify againstPresident Clinton. The paper says that the indefinite postponement ofLewinsky's deposition--originally scheduled for today--in the Paula Jones casewas sought by her attorney while he negotiates with Starr. By contrast, theWashington Post says there appears to be littlemovement towards a Starr/Lewinsky deal that would protect her from prosecutionfor perjury and obstruction of justice, adding that her lawyer says he hasn'theard from Starr since Monday. "Obviously," the Post quotes him, "ifthere's jeopardy [to Lewinsky], I'd like a deal."            The New York Timescoverage emphasizes yesterday's statement by Clinton friend and advisor VernonJordan that "absolutely and unequivocally" Lewinsky told Jordan that there wasno affair. Jordan vigorously denied telling her to lie. Everybody also reportsthat Jordan admitted he'd arranged some job interviews for Lewinsky. Readers,especially those just out of college with hardly any prior work experience, areencouraged to contact Mr. Jordan's Washington office for similar job placementassistance.            The WP still leads the way in monomaniacal Monica-mania. Besides thefull front-page treatment, the Post strews inside such items as a reporton Al Gore's first statement about the scandal (he believes his boss), acheck-in with Gennifer Flowers, and a primer for parents whose children nowsuddenly ask, "Mommy, Daddy, what is adultery?"            The Times says the White House appears to have settled on a "strategyof denial and delay," which includes attempting to undermine Lewinsky'scredibility and raising questions about her motivation. The WP reportstension inside the White House between political advisors, who feel it'simperative for Clinton to quickly and forcefully rebut allegations, and thelawyers, who warn that Clinton should keep his public comments terse andundetailed until they can assemble more facts. The Post describesmeetings held yesterday between the two groups as marked by heated debate. Thepaper reports one explanation offered by the Clinton staff that shows themeeting rooms need better ventilation: Clinton's comments during the 1992campaign could be squared with his apparent admission during last Saturday'sdeposition that he'd had an affair with Gennifer Flowers because "Clinton wasonly denying the precise descriptions of the affair that Flowers had publiclyalleged--not that any sex between them had occurred."            The NYT , in an editorial slugged "Tell the Full Story, Mr. President," says thatthe statements offered thus far by Clinton and Jordan have compounded thecase's oddities, not dissipated them.                           USAT reports that those Starr subpoenaed yesterday include not justJordan but also the widow of former Arlington National Cemetery resident LarryLawrence. The NYT says the point of that is to ask her if she had anaffair with Clinton. Others the dailies list among the Starr-struck includeClinton's personal secretary and a former Miss America. The NYT reportsthat FBI agents visited Linda Tripp's literary agent Lucianne Goldberg in NewYork and USAT has the detail that in 1972 Goldberg was paid $1,000 aweek by a high-level Nixon operative to spy on theMcGovern campaign.            Amidst all this, Jack Lord and his hair died. The obits fail to clear up anabiding mystery: Why did Kam Fong play "Chin Ho"? Why couldn't he just be "KamFong"?
