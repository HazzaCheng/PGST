                                 Fashioning Paula                           USAToday leads with Texas' settlement of its product-liability lawsuitagainst the leading tobacco companies. The top nonlocal story at the Washington Post is the latest development in the Indonesianeconomic crisis--a rare and boosterish Suharto press conference in contrast toa further plunging stock market and food riots in outlying towns. The New York Timesleads with a comprehensive poll about American attitudes concerningabortion.            In the Texas case, reports USAT , the defendant companies have agreedto pay about $15 billion over 25 years to reimburse the state for expenses itincurred in the treatment of smoking-related illnesses. That makes Texas thethird state to settle such a case, joining Florida and Mississippi. There are,says the paper, a total of 40 such suits on file, with Minnesota's turn comingnext week.            The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs' lawyershired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost $2.2billion in fees.            The NYT abortion survey, the first conducted by the paper since 1989, wasbased on telephone interviews of 1,101 people and detects "a notable shift fromgeneral acceptance" of having the procedure: from 40 percent to 32 percent. Andthe pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortiontiming: Sixty-one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permittedduring the first trimester, but only 15 percent in the second and just 7percent in the third. (The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why afocus on partial-birth abortions has proven politically advantageous forabortion foes.) Nearly 45 percent of those asked to state the present law onabortion could not give the correct answer.            The WSJ notes that the just-concluded football/TV deal will probablymean even steeper cable bills in the near future. Some local cablecompanies, the paper says, expect the fees they'll pay ESPN to go up more than20 percent. And they're in the habit of passing expenses along to Joe Remote.Even nonsports fans will be affected, notes the Journal , because ESPN isusually part of basic cable service. (Which raises the question: Hasn'ttechnology progressed to a point that would allow cafeteria-style programmingchoices by subscribers?)            A scan of the headlines found cheek-by-jowl on the WP 's Page A6provides an interesting snapshot of the life of the modern Cabinet officer:"[Ex-HUD Secretary] Cisneros's Ex-Mistress Pleads Guilty," "[Labor Secretary]Herman Denies Allegations of Influence-Selling Scheme," and "Two Tyson FoodsExecutive Indicted Over Gifts to [Ex-Agriculture Secretary] Espy."            The WSJ reports that, according to an MIT survey, Americans are twiceas likely to back a tax increase going toward the search for extraterrestrialsthan one for gene-cloning research.            The NYT reports that today's issue of the journal Science willdescribe an experiment in which people's biological clocks were reset threehours by shining a bright light on the back of their knees. The finding, if itholds up, says the Times , may lead to a simple way for airline travelersto fight jet lag.            Yesterday's Los Angeles Times ran a story under the headline "PaulaJones Works on Her Court Appearance," which, illustrated by pictures of Jones,was all about the various looks she's had since stepping on the public stage.The piece concluded that she's finally graduated to an image that's"sophisticated yet soft." Today's WP "Style" section (that's theopposite of substance, remember) picks up that ball and runs with it, with alengthy discourse on the new PJ. "It is," hyperventilatesthe Post , one of the most jaw-dropping public make-overs ever." Jonesapparently has "smoothed the frizzy mane of curls that once reached to suchdazzling heights. Her makeup is now subtle and based on natural, not neon,hues. Her clothing is inspired by the boardroom instead of the secretarialpool. She has embraced the markers of dignity, refinement and power." In truenewspaper overkill fashion, the piece backs this up by consulting Cynde Watson,national makeup artist for Bobbi Brown Essentials, and Steven Zdatny, ahistorian at West Virginia University specializing in the aesthetics andpolitics of hair.            The placement of these two pieces is a PR triumph, but one carrying theseeds of its own destruction: If people know all this work is going into makingPaula Jones seem a certain someone, doesn't that just make it obvious thatshe's really somebody else?
