                                 The Ghost of Paul Tsongas            Boone, Iowa -- Today the Democratic contest felt a lot like 1992, with AlGore playing Bill Clinton and Bill Bradley cast involuntarily in the role ofPaul Tsongas.            Like Bradley, Tsongas was a high-minded reformer who appealed most stronglyto educated, affluent voters in the Northeast. He cultivated a similar image asan anti-politician brave enough to level with voters. And like Bradley, Tsongastried to make his inverted charisma into a virtue. After he won the NewHampshire primary, Tsongas transcended his status as a media darling and gottaken seriously as someone who could actually win the Democratic nomination.But within a few weeks, he was knocked out of the race by a combination of BillClinton's effective demagoguery on Social Security and concerns about hismedical condition.             Bradley is now suffering the effects of a similar one-two punch. Over thepast few months, Gore has pummeled him using demagogic attacks straight out ofthe Clinton playbook, beating him up over Medicare and support for farmers. Andyesterday, Bradley acknowledged that his irregular heartbeat, a condition knownas atrial fibrillation, has been acting up. At a press conference yesterday,Bradley said he has had four episodes since late December. He said that thiswas nothing to be concerned about, but it sure doesn't sound like nothing.Bradley has been looking a bit pallid lately, and the fact that he's justgetting around to revealing the problem raises suspicions that he is being lessthan fully candid about it.            Gore is acting like someone who remembers what happened to Paul Tsongas. Hisdemeanor on the stump reflects the growing consensus that Bradley isfloundering and that the battle for the Democratic nomination is, if not quiteover, now a largely foregone conclusion. Gore is more than 20 points ahead inIowa, and he has erased Bradley's lead in New Hampshire according to a coupleof different polls. This has had a subtle effect on Gore's public persona. Thesomewhat desperate, insecure-seeming Gore who assaulted Bradley in an excessiveway in the early debates has receded, at least for the time being. In hisplace, the confident, dullish Gore unconcerned about a guy running against himin the primaries has returned to the fore. A piece of Gore campaign propagandahanded out to reporters today refers to the Bradley campaign in the past tense,as in "Bradley believed Iowa Caucus Critical to His Campaign." Gore himself istreating Bradley less like a threat and more like a future supporter.            To be sure, Gore still takes the odd swipe at Bradley. "The presidency isnot an academic exercise," he declared this afternoon to the crowd of "familyfarm" folk in a barn in Perry, Iowa, using one of his favorite lines. Gore alsocouldn't resist highlighting Bradley's impolitic remark that the Iowa caucusrewards "entrenched power." (Gore says, by contrast, that the Iowa caucus is"about people.") But there's not much edge to these jabs, the way there waseven a week ago when the campaign was a more plausible horse race. Gore is nolonger going for the jugular the way he did in most of the debates. Instead,he's trying to rig the all-pervasive expectations game in his favor by notinghow much more money Bradley has spent in Iowa than he has, and trying to feigna belief that a one-vote win is still a big win for him (in fact, it wouldconstitute a catastrophic reversal).            The Al Gore who isn't really worried about Bill Bradley is a much moreappealing candidate. Speaking without notes or a teleprompter, he displays atruly Clintonic depth of knowledge and a command of policy. At Gore's firstappearance this morning, at an environment conference in Des Moines, he talkedabout global warming and drift-net fishing in a way that was truly informativeand mostly lacking in pedantry (though he did go on a bit). After that, Gorevisited a hospital, where he gave an equally well-informed analysis of healthcare problems. Finally, at a farm in Perry, Iowa, Gore swapped his gray suitand tie for khakis and a barn coat, turned up the treble on his Tennesseeaccent, and strutted his ag-stuff, explaining that he wanted to step upantitrust enforcement against industrial hog producers. "We need to enforce thePackers and Stockyards Act vigorously," Gore remarked. George W. Bush mightmention something like the Packers and Stockyards Act too. But with Bush, noone would suspect he knew what he was talking about.                                             Editor's note : Jacob Weisberg will continue to filefrom Iowa throughout the weekend.
