                                 A Sorry State of Affairs                           USAToday leads with that schoolyard shooting in Arkansas, which also makesthe front at the New York Times ,Washington Post , and Los AngelesTimes . The WP and LAT lead with President Clinton'sremarks in Uganda about how, with its slave trade, the U.S. wronged Africa. TheNYT goes with the news that the federal government has delayed issuingtens of thousands of permanent residency permits for immigrants because a newmachine designed to produce fraud-proof green cards hasn't worked right sinceit was installed last summer. Few immigrants, says the paper, will suffer direconsequences but the delay is making many of them panicky.            Four students and a teacher, all female, died, and ten others were injuredat an Arkansas middle school after two boys--ages 13 and 11--shot at theirclassmates pouring out of the school in response to the false fire alarm thetwo had pulled. It was, reports USAT , the third school rampagenationwide in five months. In recent similar incidents, students have killedfive and wounded 14.            Rising to give a speech at a village outside Kampala, after listening to oneby Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, President Clinton, according to theWP , launched into what his aides later said were impromptu remarks about the role the U.S. has played in Africa'stragedies. "Going back to the time before we were even a nation, EuropeanAmericans received the fruits of the slave trade," Clinton said. "And we werewrong in that." Clinton also admitted that American Cold War policy for Africatoo often resulted in mistakenly supporting ruthless dictators just becausethey were anti-communists.            All the papers point out that previously, Clinton had considered andrejected the idea of making an official apology to American blacks for slavery.It was reported that Clinton thought a mea culpa would distract from the realtasks of racial healing and could alienate white centrist voters. And indeed,reports the WP , aides repeatedly said Clinton would not issue such anapology while on the African tour. But, says the paper, Clinton was apparentlytaken by the "spirit of the moment." According to the Post , hisspur-of-the-moment thoughts caused "consternation among his travelingdelegation."            The papers note this vibe but inexplicably internalize it, and generally tryto describe Clinton's speech as something besides what it most obviously is: anapology for slavery. The WP sees, "not strictly speaking an apology, buta remarkably all-encompassing statement of contrition." USAT , in itsoff-lead, says that with the remarks, Clinton "came as close as he ever has toapologizing for slavery, and in its lead, the LAT says he "stop[ped]short of an explicit apology." The NYT front-pager says he stopped "wellshort" of one.            Perhaps what underlies the presidential staff's concern is that the episodeis a clear reminder that Clinton is prone in the heat of the moment to dothings that in cooler moments he very publicly says he wouldn't do. Hoping notto remind folks about this was one of the reasons handlers were glad to get himout of town in the first place. And indeed, such concerns explicitly followedhim to Africa: The NYT states that reporters touring the village withClinton asked if he was invoking executive privilege in the Monica Lewinskymatter. Neither the president nor Hillary responded, even though Musevenicalled after them to make sure they heard the question.            In light of the slavery speech, "Today's Papers" wonders how long it will bebefore one of Clinton's critics complains that he apologizes for things hedidn't do, instead of apologizing for things he did.            There's a good-news story in the WP business section--let'shope it's true. It seems that the CEO of PepsiCo, Roger A. Enrico, has givenhis $900,000 salary back to the company and directed that it be used to fundscholarships for children of the corporation's grunt-level employees. Enricointends to do this indefinitely. True, Enrico's annual bonus, which he is notsurrendering, is $1.8 million, but the company says the bonus will not beenlarged to pick up the slack. The arrangement nearly doubles the company'sscholarship outlays.            Meanwhile, the WP 's "Reliable Source" column reports that on Monday,two Washington D.C. bookstores were ordered to turn over to Ken Starr sales records of purchases by Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky'slawyer, William Ginsburg is quoted in the Post with this reaction: "Wehave now gone from invasion of the right of privacy to Fahrenheit451 ."            And on tour with the president in Africa, JesseJackson gives Maureen Dowd his theology of the Lewinsky scandal: "There arenine more Commandments."
