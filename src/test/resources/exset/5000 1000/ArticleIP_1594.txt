                                 Rubber Pitches                           Before It's TooLate , produced for Ansell Inc. by Tom Eppley of Red Bank, N.J.                           One Night Stand, TwoWeeks Later , produced for Ansell Inc. by Stu Pollard of Los Angeles.                           Forget Me Not ,produced for Ansell Inc. by Rick Starbuck of Santa Barbara, Calif.            Each year, Ansell Inc., themakers of LifeStyles condoms, conducts a condom ad contest that anyone canenter--PR firm or individual, amateur or professional. Then the companybroadcasts the winners as its television advertising campaign, or tries to airthe ads themselves. MTV and the Comedy Channel routinely run the spots, butmost network affiliates outside three markets (Boston, Seattle, and Chico,Calif.) have refused so far to show them.            Under federal law,broadcasters can't censor ads for political candidates, but everythingelse--from soap to the nuttiest issue ad campaign--must meet the stations'amorphous standards of accuracy and good taste. So most of the ads you see ontelevision, believe it or not, are certified as true, defensible, and tasteful.Presumably the condom ads aren't false--the product does work; they fail ongrounds of taste.            This year's first-prizewinner, Before It's Too Late , was created by a truck driver whose hobbyis computer animation. A talking skeleton holding a LifeStyles condom in bonyfingers confides that he never used a condom because he was "too embarrassed toask for them from behind the counter," and because he'd "feel awkward stoppingin the middle of everything just to put this on." He continues: "But thenlately, I don't feel a thing."            Even before the advent ofAIDS, sex was equated with death. Before It's Too Late updates andexploits this cultural assumption, letting the viewer play with the horror ofsex and death without really confronting it. The words aren't explicit, but themessage is: "Use a condom, and you won't die."            "Don't be a BoneHead," punsthe chyron at the end of the spot, humorously encouraging its target market toreach for a condom. It conveys the sense that LifeStyles condoms must be areliable product, maybe even the best of condoms, because its makers careenough about your health to advertise it that way. We share your fear, the adimplies. Trust us to protect you from it.            The second-place ad-- OneNight Stand, Two Weeks Later --evokes a 1940s black-and-white Hollywoodmelodrama about the wages of illicit love. Our heroine punishes herself becauseshe yielded to temptation, a temptation that was probably more alluring in theearly 1980s than it is today. She meets her "out of town" guy and takes himback to her apartment. "I woke up the next morning and he was gone," she says,her voice cracking with emotion. "I spent the last two weeks worrying that Imight be pregnant, or I might have"--her voice trails off--"I don't even wantto think about it."            The spot is aimed at thewoman, the secondary consumer of condoms, reminding her that an alternative to"no" is "wait a minute," followed by a quick dip into her nightstand drawer fora rubber.            Speaking of drawers: Thethird-place finisher, Forget Me Not , features an animated condom in adrawer. Lonely and anxious to be used, the condom grows so weary of the waitthat he throws away his watch: Either the condom's owner is abstinent, or he'scareless. Sad organ music is suddenly replaced by an upbeat, jazzy score: Theowner opens the drawer and takes the package. Virtually without narration, thespot ends with a row of condom packages morphing into the name of theproduct.            This spot is more likely toraise the hackles of the pressure groups than some of the others. For one, theproduct--and all that it connotes--is visible. And the computer animation andcheerful music suggest that sex is a fun consumable. The spot does leave theviewer wondering about the rest of the story, and what tale the condom couldtell.            What'snext? A LifeStyles ad for extra-large condoms? Wouldn't that move condoms!Maybe it would. Since the 1994 debut of the company's television ad campaign,LifeStyles has become the fastest growing brand.            --RobertShrum
