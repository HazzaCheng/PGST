                                 The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna                        Dear Joe,            I know what you mean about being a journalist. Almost every assignment is achallenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier. I often feel asif I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount ofreporting that is most often much more than I will ever need. I think that iswhy I welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what isleft on the cutting room floor of daily journalism.            Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that wenever add to stories. Most often reporters recount these tales with each otherand with their sources rather than share them with the general public. Much ofit, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since itis largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for somevery good stories. I often wonder when a really great fictional book will bewritten about this era (probably decades and decades hence as it is too close).In any case, there certainly is no lack of information available about themoguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons. I wouldposit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of thecurrent age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur.            So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me towatch. The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully. Ipersonally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on justone man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other"characters," for lack of a better word. So there, while you think of Case, youalso think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives.Steve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, butit still seems to be Bill's show over there.            While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highlyamusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunchlaughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating andthe insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good. That's ironic, since Ithink it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way thatAOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in SiliconValley. AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here, I am sure,since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati. Outin the D.C. area, they looked positively exciting next to all thegovernment-oriented contractors. I wonder if that means geography is destiny,and it's still location, location, location.            From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the reallyobvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. I think italmost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance ofpower is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land. Will thestrongman of the era be AOL, AT&T, Microsoft, or one of the big mediacompanies? Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows andencourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection ofbusinesses where none are allowed to dominate?            I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whetherit is AOL or Microsoft or Disney--is in charge of all our destinies: Babylonwas. That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seempossible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire's grip onhumanity. But we all know how that story turned out.            Now I am getting way too philosophical, but this is my final missive, so whynot? Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going. As forme, I'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and, I guess, life--nobodyknows.            Cheers,Kara
