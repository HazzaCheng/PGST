                                 He's Going to the Long Bomb ... YES!            The LosAngeles Times and USA Today lead with President Clinton's call forratification of a comprehensive nuclear test ban. The New York Timesleads with the imminent return--under very tight regulations--of the approveduse of thalidomide. And the Washington Post goes with Clinton's first comments abouthis 1996 fund-raising activities since Janet Reno announced she was taking alook at them that might lead to an independent counsel.            Clinton's advocacy of the test ban came during his speech yesterday at theUnited Nations. USAT reminds readers that Clinton was the first leaderin the world to sign the treaty a year ago, and says his position sets thestage for a confrontation with congressional Republicans. Additionally, thepaper points out that in his speech, Clinton also promised that the UnitedStates would pay off the bulk of the $1.5 billion in back dues it owes theUnited Nations, and supported a special international court to prosecute crimesagainst humanity.            The LAT lead about Clinton's U.N. appearance covers the same basicmaterial, but also has some good background on the test-ban treaty, statingthat the chief domestic-policy obstacle to a ban since Eisenhower first soughtone is the fear that the United States cannot maintain its nuclear deterrentwithout testing. The paper points out that Clinton is trying to address theformer problem by ensuring that a $4.5-billion annual nontest-explosionresearch program will adequately maintain the nation's nuke stockpile. TheWP and NYT put their coverage inside. The Times has thedetail that the ban may take a long time to go into effect because the 44countries believed to have some sort of nuclear capability would have toapprove it first. It's amazing to live in a world where that number doesn'tmake the front page.            The WP reports that Clinton said yesterday that he and Vice PresidentGore "believed we were acting within the letter of the law" when raising fundsfor the '96 campaign. This is contrasted with the stronger position takenearlier this year. One main reason for the softening, says the paper, is thatClinton doesn't want to appear to be pressuring Reno. Another is that if Renofinds an infraction did occur, the issue may well shift to the question ofClinton's (and Gore's) intent when soliciting contributions. The NYTpiece on Clinton's response makes the same main points, and has the sameexplanatory quote from him, but juxtaposes this with an interview with Sen.Fred Thompson, in which he says his panel's investigation ultimately woulddemonstrate the need for an independent counsel.            The Wall Street Journal , in its front-page business and financenews box, reports that on Monday, the FTC sharply criticized the proposednational tobacco settlement, concluding that the cigarette makers could reapbig profits that far exceed the penalties the pact imposes on them. The FTCstand, says the Journal , strengthens the hand of President Clinton andothers who want a tougher tobacco settlement.            A hearty "No Duh!" goes out to the LAT for its headline over today'sinstallment of the paper's series on political fund raising: "Where Big DonorsTread, Big Favors Seem to Follow."            In an NYT op-ed, Erika Niedowski, a reporter for theinside-the-Beltway newsletter the Hill , points out that severallawmakers who sit on the Thompson fund-raising investigating committee havethemselves paid stiff fines for violating state and federal election laws.            The Post covers the opening of the Marv Albert trial on the frontpage (it's taking place in nearby suburban Virginia). The headline reads "MarvAlbert Trial Opens With Graphic Descriptions," and indeed, there is mention of(allegations of) three-way sex, oral sex, bite marks on the woman's back, andsemen in her underwear. One thing that is not mentioned, however, is thewoman's name. She is cited in the article merely as a "41-year-old Vienna [Va.]woman." The NYT follows the same practice in its trial coverage, whichis inside the paper, differing only in saying that the woman is 42. Fair?
