                                 Making It                        Hello, Richard:            I wanted to go back to something you said yesterday, asit has been rattling around my brain all night. You noted an "immense dividebetween wired-up, screwed-up America ... and a quieter America where men maysuffer far less from identity crises because they are trying to get by ratherthan get ahead." I have already discussed the fact that "wired up" America isfar more extensive than its presumably "screwed up" epicenters. But now I wantto address the notion that one must be in Los Angeles, New York, or theequivalent, to be "getting ahead." That formulation strikes me as emblematic ofthe very ornamental culture that Faludi derides. For many of the peoplebattling it out in these places, "winning" or "getting ahead" means beingnoticed by the others--on camera, in the news, in a magazine, and so on. Thementality of "others notice me, therefore I am" is quite appropriate if you are14 years old, but pretty pathetic for a grown-up. This "ornamental culture" islike a perpetual twilight of adolescence; it is a thwarted adulthood. For thosewho exist only in the gaze of others, "getting ahead" may well mean achievingmore time at the center of attention, but that really gets them nowhere new,and least of all "ahead." Maybe that explains Susan Faludi's enigmatic visageon the cover of Newsweek --participating in theornamentation thing, but knowing better.            The real challenge of "getting ahead" as an adult isfar more complex. It involves the work of forging an identity that hascoherence and integrity, whether or not anyone is looking. But adultdevelopment, as Gilligan, Kegan, and many others have noted, does not stopthere with the achievement of an autonomous identity. It can also mean learningthat my humanity is larger than the roles I inhabit, and in the exploration ofmy individuality I also, paradoxically, discover the possibility of a deeperconnection with many kinds of people. Autonomy is not an end in itself but afoundation for the ongoing work of individuation and real intimacy. Thesetriumphs of adulthood are hard won, and as you said about children, they oftenspring from darkness and grief. They always spring from engaging with themessiness of real life.            All over America, and indeed all over the world, peopleare "getting ahead," in this truer sense; they are not merely "getting by."They are geologists and hospice workers and emergency-room doctors and researchscientists and lobstermen and forest rangers and cooks and microbiologists andfarmers and mechanics and entrepreneurs and programmers and small-businesspeople and mothers and veterinarians and teachers. They are in the hills of thealtiplano, caring for their land and their animals and their families. They arein the Brazilian rain forest, fighting ranchers and government ineptitude. Theyare in East Timor, standing for independence. They are in all the quiet placeswhere the cameras do not roam, making love, making family, making dinner, andmaking a world. They are not hanging around making bombs and complaining aboutlost dominance. Nor is Donald Trump their role model. They are too busy forthat. Too busy getting ahead.            I am persuaded that the new economy already shows signsof offering much more opportunity for adults to move beyond the conformistpressures of the large 20 th -centuryorganizations and the fragmented identities of industrial society. I think thisemerging era will provide more adults with the possibility of becomingindividuals, as it enables us to reintegrate work and life in many new rich andvaried patterns. (And by the way, only about 20 percent of those home offices Imentioned yesterday are dedicated to telework.)            Once again, hats off to Susan Faludi for theauthenticity of her effort and the seriousness of her subject. Whether or not Iagree with her analysis, I do think that these times require a reexamination ofmany century-old formulations, including masculinity and particularly the rolethat gender has played in the maintenance of traditional economic models. Maythe debate continue so that we can all, well, get ahead ...            As ever,Shoshana Zuboff
