Randy'sSelf-Reference Wrap-Up                        To our youngest players, the title of Thursday'squestion may be as ancient and obscure as Edgar Bergen's wacky catch phrase:"I'm a ventriloquist on the radio, suckers!" or Pedro's "S'all right." Ah,Pedro, Pedro, Pedro. In last Wednesday's New York Times , Richard Severoremembered: "Originally, Pedro had a body that was crushed in a train wrecknear Chicago. Seor Wences, salvaging the head, put it in a box. At first,those who booked the act resisted; they did not think people would relate to ahead in a box. Seor Wences prevailed and Pedro proved almost as big a hit asJohnny." Not Heeere's Johnny. Not quiz question Johnny. This Johnny was just awig and a smear of lipstick on a clenched fist, but he made Seor Wences thatrarest of performers, a genuinely funny ventriloquist. Seor Wences died lastTuesday at age 103.            Some other Johnniesneglected by quiz participants--Johnny Angel (Shelley Fabares), Johnny One Note(Rodgers and Hart), Johnny Too Bad (a swell song from The Harder TheyCome ), and this line of dialogue from the 1959 racially charged Englishmurder mystery Sapphire , spoken, if I recall correctly, by Horace BigCigar (Robert Adams): "We got plenty Johnnies, boss." Indeed we do.                           Johnny on the SpotAnswer                        Johnny Cash is endorsingcomputer bibles. And he's not just a pitchman; he's a user. He's also in on themanufacturing: The man in black narrates the desktop version of the King JamesBible, scheduled for a July release.                           Death With DignityExtra                        A published photograph ofJoe DiMaggio's memorial service last Friday in St. Patrick's Cathedral showsRudolph Giuliani seated next to Henry Kissinger. Despite the crude colorreproduction used by the Times , you can actually see the cloud of pureevil hanging over these two men. (Or is that Phil Rizzuto's head?) Right behindthem you can just make out a portal opening up to hell, presumably for thearrival of George Steinbrenner.            Deeply reverential fun facts:                           Dr. Rock Positano, organizer of the day's events, was DiMaggio's footdoctor. He has also treated the feet of Mort Zuckerman, Giuliani, andKissinger.               The post-mourning brunch was held at Le Cirque 2000. Few could eat throughtheir grief. If by "few" you mean "all."               Steinbrenner said his conversation with brunch partner Kissinger was"better than my four years at Williams. But I didn't know any mass murderers atWilliams." If by "said" you exclude the final sentence.               Did I make that clear? He's held the naked feet of Zuckerman, Giuliani, andKissinger. Disgusting yet biblical yet disgusting.                                       CommonDenominator                        Johnny Carson's inadequate circulatory system.
