                                 Culturebox Says: Sue the Bastard!            Journalists tend to think that libel law exists to let rich and famousslimeballs escape criticism, but there are times when the law, even thenotoriously anti-press British version of it, does what it's supposed to do:protect the innocent against unfounded accusations of crimes of a heinousnature. The BBC's refusal to air British filmmaker's Nick Broomfield'sdocumentary about Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain, at least not withoutsubstantial changes, for fear of being sued by Love, is taken by Culturebox asevidence that on occasion, sir, the law is not an ass.            In the movie, currently being shown on 10 screens in the United States,Broomfield tracks down wierdos of the you-couldn't-make-these-people-up varietyto get them to accuse Love not just of being a jerk, but of being a murderer.Broomfield's freak show includes a sadist-turned-rocker with the eyes ofCharlie Manson who all but acknowledges he'll say anything for a beer. A crazedand abusive former Grateful Dead manager from whose unparental loins it isLove's tragedy to have sprung. An eerily slow-spoken private detective straightout of a David Lynch movie. A nanny with suspiciously strung-out friends. Allhave theories about why and how Love killed her late husband. None offers solidevidence or is remotely credible.            Love may or may not be likeable--Culturebox suspects she's both phenomenallytalented and a glorious bitch--but Broomfield isn't addressing that question.His main objective appears to be to air these patently ludicrous accusations.What else could he do? he asks us plaintively. After all, she wouldn't talk tohim. She even got MTV to pressure Showtime into pulling out of the project.            Reviews have been mixed, but smart critics who should have known better havedismissed Broomfield's journalistic malevolence as fun, wacky, postmodern, anexpose of the seamy underbelly of fame by a renegade who eschews the boringobjectivity of the documentary tradition. They're so impressed by Bloomfield'sadversarial stance toward celebrity culture that they overlook the mainachievement of the film, which is (here Culturebox must repeat herself): to airaccusations of murder without offering evidence that the accused is guilty ofanything other than being an ambitious loudmouth and drug user.            Another reason the critics are letting Bloomfield get away with it: As theTruman Show also made clear this week, sadism makes for greattelevision, and great television excuses everything. Think of Ed Harristorturing Jim Carrey, the whole world watching in thrall.            Broomfield too is something of a professional sadist. The British know that,having seen more of Broomfield's movies and regarding him as the Britishequivalent of Michael Moore, the director of the unprincipled Roger &Me . But Americans who see Kurt and Courtney and think that wherethere's smoke, there may be fire, might not realize that for the last decade orso, Broomfield has made movies whose sole purpose appears to be to stalk,torment, and libel the controversial female public figures he chooses as hissubjects. Then he claims it's because they won't cooperate with him.            Lily Tomlin sued him for $7.5 million. Margaret Thatcher simply eluded him.Accused Florida serial-killer Aileen Wuornos did talk to him, but, as the moviealso demonstrated, she was sadly ill-equipped to judge who was exploiting hernotoriety and who might help her out. Heidi Fleiss he just ambushed, afterdigging up all sorts of unbelievable charges about her then failing to refutethem.            When Courtney Love denied Broomfield the rights to Cobain's music and triedto get his movie quashed, she may not have been acting as the poster-girl forthe ACLU that the organization perhaps naively tried to turn her into, but shewas exercising her constitutionally-guaranteed right to protect her reputationagainst the worst form of libel there is. Culturebox cheers her on.            -- Judith Shulevitz
