                                 Women, Providence, and Judging Amy                           Judging Amy , a CBS drama premiering tonight at 10 p.m., imitatesNBC's Providence , which returns for another season on Friday at 8 p.m.,and Providence incarnates a new kind of show second in hotness only tothose aimed at teen-agers: the series meant to keep high-spending grown-upwomen from abandoning network television. (Now that Geraldine Laybourne hasstarted Oxygen, a cable channel for women, the networks fear that the hithertomale world of cable could start stealing their loyal female viewers.)              Both shows feature leggy professional babes with big, fabulous tresses (AmyBrenneman of NYPD Blue as Amy in Judging Amy , Melina Kanakaredesas Syd Hansen in Providence ) who have thrown over high-powered careers(corporate law for Amy, plastic surgery for Syd) in fast-paced cities (NewYork, Los Angeles) for noble, self-sacrificing careers (family court judge,family doctor) in depressed Northeastern cities (Hartford, Providence), wherethey both move in with their families. The divorcing Amy is marginally morebelievable as a woman whose life has taken a scary new turn than theunflappable single Syd ever was--Amy gets flustered; she doesn't know what towear; her clothes don't seem designed to show off an improbably sculpted body,as Syd's do; she has no pat reasons for having left her husband; her mom,played by Tyne Daly, is pitch-perfect as the smart, confident older woman whoquashes her daughter (she's a more compelling character than Syd's father, awan veterinarian who can do no wrong); and Amy's own daughter--well, Amy'sdaughter is unbearable, a stereotypical know-it-all TV tyke. Overall, though,both shows are riffs on the same Mary Tyler Moore theme, which after 30years has become the key slogan of TV feminism: They're going to make it afterall.             The difference between Mary Richards and these two, of course, is that shewas striking out on her own, and they, having done so, are coming home. Is thisTV's blow against feminism? If we see the shows in a Mary Tyler Moore-erafeminist perspective, the answer would probably be yes. Something hasdefinitely gone wrong with their ambitions to become successful professionals.But the twist is that Syd and Amy's problems don't have much to do with theirbeing female. Their issue is, they don't like their jobs. Syd and Amy don't gohome to become homemakers or marry high-school sweethearts. They go homebecause they choose occupations that mean more to them--in which, as Amy saysin tonight's episode of Judging Amy , they get to "make adifference"--but pay less. (There are secondary reasons: Syd wants to take careof her widowed father, Amy wants to get away from life with her ex-husband.)Both have long been the achievers in their families. Both have trod a well-wornmeritocratic path from A's in school to top-flight colleges to well-payingprofessions--without really knowing what they wanted to be once they got towherever they were going. Amy feels she's been on autopilot: Whenever anopportunity presented itself, she says, "I had to do it. I couldn't fail. Idon't fail well."            But their compulsion to suceed and their advanced degrees do them littlegood when it comes to getting along with regular people, a skill they must andeventually do master. (Actually, Syd gets it instinctively, another way inwhich she's smugly annoying.) When they grow, as characters in televisiondramas must, it is by learning that their former positions in the upper-middleclasses don't give them any particular edge over the common folk they findthemselves among. In short, Amy and Syd are TV populists, not TVanti-feminists. They could be Jimmy Stewart at the end of It's a WonderfulLife , or politicians preparing to run for president, or even, perhaps, thefantasy projections of self-pitying network executives who wish they couldchuck the lunches at the Dome and the whole rat race and just go home again.That the women are women is more a reflection of the network'sdemographic needs at the moment than of anything else. Their sex is incidentalto the theme--which in a perverse sort of way may make these the most feministseries on television today.
