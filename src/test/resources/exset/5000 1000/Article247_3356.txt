                                 Cocaine Straw Poll                        Issue 1 is the Clinton-GOP tax-cut war. Issue 2 is Hillary's Talkmagazine interview. Issue 3 is campaign 2000--including the upcoming Iowa strawpoll and Bush's refusal to talk about cocaine-use rumors.            The opinion mafia grows increasingly pessimistic that a tax-cut compromisewill be reached this year--this despite assertions to the contrary by HouseMajority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas (on Fox News Sunday ), and SenatorsGeorge Voinovich, R-Ohio, and  Rick Santorum, R-Pa. (on CNN's LateEdition ). Clinton's veto threat is real, the pundits say, and the GOP justwants to use the tax issue as an electoral weapon (Al Hunt, of CNN'sCapitol Gang ; Paul Gigot, of PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrerand Fox ; Fox's Mara Liasson and Juan Williams; Late               Edition's Susan Page and Steve Roberts). Gigot points out that manyDemocrats want to see the tax issue off the table, and that at leastHouse Republicans are willing to pass a bill, if not Senate ones.Late                Edition's Tucker Carlson points out that a do-nothingCongress isn't a bad thing, while Hunt thinks the GOP passed the tax cuts toplease campaign contributors, not to campaign for. A few otherpundits--including Clarence Page and John Fund (both of PBS's TheMcLaughlin Group )--think the president will compromise at the 11th hour,as he did with welfare reform in 1996.            For the second week in a row the pundits slam Hillary for her comments inTalk magazine. Some say her probable New York senate campaign is apublic exercise of  marital therapy ( Capitol                Gang's KateO'Beirne and McLaughlin's Tony Blankley). John McLaughlin trots out a1992 campaign video in which Hillary praises Bill's grandmother--the same womanHillary seemed to blame in Talk . Even Hillary's defenders, such asMcLaughlin's Eleanor Clift and Fox's Susan Estrich, admitthat the comments were unfortunate. Fox's Dick Morris proposes thatHillary's interview was part of an elaborate fundraising strategy for hersenate campaign; the comments may hurt her politically, Morris reasons, butdefending the president helps her curry favor with her husband's campaigncontributors. Clift points out that when the Lewinsky story first broke, thesame McLaughlin panelists who now decry Hillary's attempts atpsychoanalysis were enthusiastically probing the roots of the president's "sexaddiction."            Pundits are divided on the importance of the upcoming Iowa straw poll. Some,like Bill Kristol and George F. Will of ABC's This                Week ,think it genuinely tests a candidate's grassroots organizing ability. Others,like Carlson, argue that since voting in the straw poll costs $25 and is on aweekday, the candidates who can afford to bus and subsidize the most peoplewill win. Most agree that Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander, and Pat Buchanan havethe most to lose. Some speculate that Gary Bauer could make a surprisinglystrong showing.            Most pundits agree that George W.'s refusal to answer questions aboutpossible cocaine use is untenable. Kristol, Will, and This               Week's George Stephanopoulos agree that Bush's response indicates "achink in the armor." Will notes that in Bush's Talk magazine interview(separate from Hillary's), Bush uses the f-word frequently and seems to pokefun at a former death-row prisoner to whom he refused clemency. Among thedissenters: Novak thinks cocaine use is "an irrelevant question in politics,"and O'Beirne and Williams say it won't matter because Bush's lead is toostrong.                           Why Not Just Use the B-Word, Bob?"This wasn't an accident, as some of the Democratic operatives aresaying--[that] she just blurted it out. She is a very manipulative, connivingperson."--Robert Novak, on Hillary's marital revelations in Talk                                       Hey, Kid--I've Been There"I mean, I've sat in these [White House] meetings years ago. I know how itworks."--Dick Morris, when another Fox panelist doubts his theory thatHillary's Talk interview was an intentional fundraising strategy                           Last Word"Next week we're going to find out she's one-twelfth Puerto Rican."--Tony Blankley on Hillary's assertion that her grandmother's second husbandwas Jewish
