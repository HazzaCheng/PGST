                                 God Bless Monica Lewinsky                           GodBless Monica Lewinsky                                                         Slate                had morethan 270,000 individual visitors in January. These are people, or at leastbrowsers, who visited slate.com at least once during the month.            As we have explained inthe past, we regard individual visitors--or, technically, "unique browsers"--asthe best measure of Web readership. It is not perfect: It treats a single,brief drop-in and a dedicated daily visitor exactly the same when counting; fortechnical reasons, some visitors don't get counted; and it doesn't include the25,000 who get                   Slate                by e-mail or the thousands more who are e-mailed "Today's Papers" every day. But the other common measurements--pagesserved, or "hits"--are even more defective. Just for the record, though, inDecember, we reported serving 140,000 pages a day. That is now up to about200,000.            Thesenumbers have risen dramatically in the past few months, and especially in thepast few weeks. How to explain it? We like to think, of course, that it is dueto loyal                   Slate                readers spreading the word about our splendideditorial product. We also would like to--and do--credit our recent allianceswith America Online, the Microsoft Network, Hotmail, and the Motley Fool. Butit just might be that recent developments in Washington have had something todo with it, too.            Like all responsible media outlets,                   Slate               deplores the deplorable situation that forces us to discuss deplorable matterssuch as alleged fellatio in the White House rather than global warming or thestrategic balance in the Persian Gulf. We deplore the tawdry chain of eventsitself--whether the deplorable scenario should turn out to be a presidentmisbehaving and lying about it under oath, or the government brought to a haltby the fevered imaginings of an overexcitable young woman. Whatever happenedexactly, it is deplorable. And we deplore it.            That said, we can't helpacknowledging that whether or not Monica Lewinsky serviced the president, shecertainly has serviced us. Not just us but CNN, the New                York               Times , Leno and Letterman, and every other outlet of news, analysis, andcommentary in every medium. She also has serviced the president's politicalopponents, all of whom, of course, deplore the situation as much as we in themedia deplore it. For that matter the general public, though generallydisgusted (whether by the alleged activity or the process that made it a publicissue or both), has also gained considerable pleasure and excitement from thisadmittedly deplorable episode.            Let us all, therefore, take abrief moment off from all this deploring to say: "Thank you, Monica. Thank you,thank you, thank you." And if there's anything we at                   Slate                inparticular can ever do ... some software, perhaps?            We nowreturn to our regularly scheduled deploring.

TrueStory                        So a guyfrom CNN, a guy from a defense contractor, and a guy from an oil company aretalking at a Washington reception. It's around 1993. Someone asks the CNN guy,"How are the ratings these days?"            CNN guy (hint: now at                  Slate               ): Not so good. We could use another war.            Defense contractor: Socould we.            Oil guy: So could we, aslong as it's in the Middle East.            Moral:Oral sex saves lives! We don't need a war to give the media a boost after all.Monica, thank you again. What it all does for the oil and defense industries isless clear.
