                                 Videosyncracies                           USAToday leads with Jimmy Carter going public with his thoughts on theClinton fund-raising brouhaha. The New York Timeslead is that the top Republican tax writer in the House will introducelegislation to radically alter IRS audit and dispute resolution procedures. TheLosAngeles Times leads with state and local attempts at campaign reform.The Washington Post goes with Israel's decision topermit the extradition of a 17-year-old back to Maryland to stand trial for agruesome murder, despite his claim that he's an Israeli citizen. This was alocal story that became a national one when Israel's earlier pronouncement thathe could not be extradited had appeared to threaten U.S.-Israeli relations.            On a Sunday CNN broadcast, Carter said that the investigation of Clinton'sfund-raising should be turned over to an independent counsel. According toUSAT , Carter said the scandal has enforced the "not always erroneous"impression that getting help from Washington requires paying a "legal bribe."The paper also reports that Rep. Dan Burton said on CBS' "Face the Nation" thathe thinks some of the fund-raising videotapes may have been "altered in someway," that Sen. Arlen Specter said on Fox News Sunday that video of Clintondescribing how DNC ads were helping him "is proof that he was evading the law,"and that according to the Newsweek coming out today, at least one fatcat, Richard Jenrette, has come forward to say Bill Clinton called him up fromthe White House to ask for money. The WP has both the Burton andJenrette stories, but runs them inside.            The NYT lead explains that Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the HouseWays and Means Committee, is seizing on the recent uproar over IRS misbehaviorto put forward a legislative evergreen suddenly considered to have a good shotat passage: a plan to shift the burden of proof in tax disputes from thetaxpayer to the IRS. The move is being strongly opposed by the Clintonadministration and many tax experts on the ground that adopting it would clogthe system, risk a decrease in tax revenues, and force the IRS to become evenmore aggressive. The paper points out that the number of people likely to beaffected by the change would be quite small--there are only 2 million auditsannually and only about 1,500 of them end up in court.            Although the line-item veto had been the darling of several Republicanpresidents, the Wall Street Journal , after surveying Clinton's targetedcuts last week of federal subsidies to such corporations as Westinghouse and3M, complains today that the administration's line-item decision process "canappear often arbitrary and highly vulnerable to politics." The paper says thenew presidential tool creates "post-season budget playoffs."            A USAT front-page story reports that Honda has developed a virtuallypollution-free gasoline engine that will be as powerful as conventional ones,and yet not more expensive.            The WP reports on its front page that a high-priority, classifiedalert issued by the CIA last August saying that Russia had probably conducted anuclear test on an island near the Artic Circle--an alert that resulted in theformal bawling out of the Russian ambassador to the U.S.--was, in alllikelihood, a mistake. What the CIA detected, it turns out, was anearthquake.            Despite such laws as the new federal anti-stalker statute, the NYTreports that New York State inmates are able to get home addresses of partiesconnected to crimes they were convicted of, as well as crime scene photos ofvictims via the state Freedom of Information Act. Civil liberties groups, saysthe paper, vow to fight any reduction in a prisoner's right to file FOIArequests.            Back to the NYT story on restraining the IRS: There's exactly oneexample given of the kinds of cases the revision would apply to, and it speaksvolumes about the sort of people Republican tax reformers and/or Timesreporters and editors most naturally think of: "...cases where the taxpayer andthe IRS presented conflicting but equally credible evidence--for example, thevalue of a painting given to a museum..."
