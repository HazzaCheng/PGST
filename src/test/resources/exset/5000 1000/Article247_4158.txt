                                 Remember Los Alamos            The Washington Post and the New York Times lead with the arrest offormer Los Alamos nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee. Lee is being held without bailon 59 counts of mishandling nuclear weapon design, construction, and testinginformation. The indictment alleges that Lee downloaded data onto 10 portabletapes and that seven tapes are missing. Lee is not specifically accused ofleaking secrets to the Chinese. Yet, the NYT notes, to convict Lee onall counts the government must prove that he intended to injure the UnitedStates and benefit a foreign power. The Post explains that theindictment might be an attempt to squeeze new leads out of Lee. The chargescarry life sentences. Lee's attorneys claim he is innocent of wrongdoing. ALAT front-pager underscores that the indictment does not clarify howChina acquired nuclear secrets.            The LosAngeles Times leads with Turkey's acceptance of an offer to apply formembership in the European Union. Ankara was reluctant to accede because offears that the EU would pressure Turkey to relinquish its claim to Cyprus. Tojoin, Turkey must improve its human rights record by abolishing the use oftorture and loosening free speech strictures. A NYT front-pager mentionsthat two years ago the EU angered the United States and embarrassed Ankara byvoting not to extend an offer of accession to Turkey. None of the papers notethat Turkey has been seeking EU membership since the 1960s.            A Post front-pager stresses that the EU expanded its applicant poolby extending offers to Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, andMalta. Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia arealready negotiating EU entry. If all applicants are approved, the EU willbecome a 28-nation union that encompasses nearly all of central and easternEurope. (The EU also endorsed a plan to create a European rapid-reaction forceof 60,000 troops.)            The NYT fronts the death of Franjo Tudjman, the first president ofindependent Croatia. The Times provides plenty of biographical detail:Tudjman rose to power as a Communist general, in the 1970s and 1980s he wasimprisoned for nationalist activities, and he died of cancer-relatedcomplications. The Post and LAT reefer their obits.            The Post highlights Tudjman low points--he forced the exodus of600,000 Serbs (200,000 according to the LAT ), hindered the search forsuspected war criminals, and neglected Croatia's economy.(                  Slate               's "Assessment" explains that Tudjman wasthe Balkans' lesser evil.) The LAT reports that during Tudjman's reignhe enriched his family by about $700 million. The Croatian Constitutiondictates that Parliament Speaker Vlatko Pavletic will serve as interimpresident until a new leader is selected.            The NYT fronts Bill Bradley's timeout. After suffering a bout ofheart palpitations, the candidate cancelled a campaign appearance and threefund-raisers. He went to the hospital but did not require treatment. In 1996Bradley was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation--a heart rhythm problem thatafflicts former President Bush and about 2 million other Americans. TheLAT reefers the story but notes that health questions dogged the lateSen. Paul Tsongas' 1992 presidential campaign. The paper indicates that Bradleyreceived mild electrical shocks to treat his arrhythmia on three occasionsprior to 1998. (The NYT reports that Bradley underwent the"cardioversion" treatment twice.) In a reefer, the Post downplaysBradley's health problem.            Wilderness programs for wayward kids are the latest frontier of the therapyindustry, according to a NYT front-pager. Hundreds of programs aim torehabilitate troubled teens by forcing them to brave the rigors of the greatoutdoors. The Redcliff Ascent Outdoor Therapy Program provides group counselingand forbids sarcasm. Although the concept is as old as Emerson, parents pay asmuch as $350 a day.
