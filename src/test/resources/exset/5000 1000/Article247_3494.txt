                                 Gotcha!            The LosAngeles Times and the Washington Post lead with the arrests of nearly 60airport workers in Miami on charges related to drug and weapons trafficking(the other papers all front this story). USA Today leadswith a widening investigation of money laundering in Russia. The amountsinvolved may top $15 billion, and political insiders including Boris Yeltsin'sdaughter could be implicated. The New York Timesleads with the FBI's backing down from their six-year denial that incendiarydevices were used during the siege of the Branch Davidian compound, a storythat's fronted by the WP . The LAT, WP, and the Wall StreetJournal front the capture of a high-ranking Bosnian Serb militaryofficial by the U.N. war crimes tribunal.            A two-year sting operation nabbed dozens of American Airlines ramp workers,employees of Sky Chef (a food catering service used by American), and a handfulof INS and customs officials. The workers used their security clearance andfree flight privileges to smuggle fake cocaine and hand grenades for undercoverfederal agents in 37 different incidents. The arrests may be related to lastweekend's arrests of 10 Colombians in Cali who were also using AmericanAirlines planes to smuggle drugs. The papers suggest that American has provenparticularly prone to smuggling problems because it has the most service todrug-exporting countries such as Colombia. The NYT plays up aninteresting safety angle: Not only is smuggling laughably easy, it'spotentially very dangerous. Smugglers often stashed contraband close tosensitive equipment, or among the in-flight food. Authorities were tipped offto the smuggling ring when a pilot complained of weak in-flight coffee--it hadbeen accidentally laced with heroin.            Various organized crime bosses and politicos are being scrutinized by theFBI, the Treasury Department, and other U.S. and British agencies. At least $15million was filtered through two New York-based banks to a company owned bySemion Mogilevich, an alleged leader of Russia's largest crime syndicate. Alongwith Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter and adviser, Yeltsin's formerfinance ministers and a former deputy prime minister are under investigation.Interestingly, not all of the money laundered was ill-gotten, as is usually thecase. In addition to revenues from prostitution and contract killings, as muchas $10 billion of the money in question may have come from IMF loans.            A former senior FBI official told reporters this week that tear gascanisters used on the Branch Davidians could have started the fire thatdestroyed the group's compound. Until now, the FBI has insisted that the teargas fired at the compound had no incendiary potential. Though the FBI directorand Attorney General Janet Reno have ordered a renewed inquiry into the events,they still deny that the tear gas canisters could have caused the blaze--theywere fired, apparently to no effect, hours before the fire began. The WPexplains why all this is coming to light now: further investigation by adocumentary filmmaker and attorneys for siege victims. The filmmaker alsoclaims to have footage demonstrating that an FBI helicopter fired on thecompound, another action that has been repeatedly denied.            General Momir Talic, the Bosnian Serb army's chief of staff, is the highestranking official to be seized by the war crimes tribunal. During Bosnia's civilwar, Talic was part of a Bosnian Serb "crisis staff" formed to carry out ethniccleansing in northwestern Bosnia. Mass graves containing over 1500 Muslim andCroat corpses have been uncovered in the territories he controlled during theconflict. Thus far, 34 of the tribunal's 67 war criminals have beenapprehended. The LAT points out this irony: Talic was in Vienna toattend a conference on cooperation between Bosnian Serbs and Bosnia'sMuslim-Croat federation when he was arrested.            According to a front page NYT story, the army's investigation of anopenly gay Republican state legislator who was also in the Army Reserves hasre-ignited debate over the armed forces' "don't ask, don't tell" policy. SteveMay was "outed" in his 1996 campaign for the Arizona State Senate, but the Armyinvestigation began only after he spoke out against antigay cuts in health carebenefits. The story notes an interesting fact: Since its 1994 inception, thenumber of armed forces personnel discharged for homosexuality has actuallyincreased steadily. The 1998 yearly tally (1,145 discharged) is nearly doublethe 1994 count. The Pentagon announced earlier this month that it will reviseits guidelines for carrying out the policy.
