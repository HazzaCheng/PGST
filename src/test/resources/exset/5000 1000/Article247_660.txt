                                 Bloody Saturday            The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times lead with new terror in NorthernIreland: a car bomb exploded Saturday in a crowded shopping area in Omagh, atown west of Belfast, killing at least 28 people and injuring hundreds more.The Washington Post , which runs the story at the fold,calls it "the single worst terrorist incident in the 30-year history ofsectarian warfare" in the province. For its lead the Post turns to athree-story spread on President Clinton's upcoming grand jury testimony. Thebanner lead reports that Clinton's lawyers think he will revise his story forMonday's testimony--i.e. he will admit to sexual relations with MonicaLewinsky, but will not admit to perjury.            The terrible toll in the Northern Ireland bombing was partly due to amisleading warning about the bomb's location. A caller warned of a bomb nearthe Omagh courthouse, but the bomb actually exploded in an area where thecrowds had retreated to get away from the courthouse. Prominent among the earlysuspects is a radical Irish Republican Army "splinter group" which opposes thepeace agreement between Catholics and Protestants that was ratified last May.The LAT and the NYT state early on that the explosion mayjeopardize the peace agreement, but the WP notes in its second paragraphthat "local Protestant and Catholic leaders insisted that the tragedy . . .would not block implementation" of the agreement.            Back in Scandalworld: The WP lead, while suggesting that Clinton maytestify to a sexual relationship, also notes that he is prone to last-minutechanges of mind and could go against his advisors' recommendations. Anotherpiece in the WP front-page package describes the intense legalpreparation on both sides. Strategizing aside, though, Clinton's testimonyhinges on his "own lonely struggle over whether to admit a relationship withLewinsky despite his past denials." The third WP piece chroniclesClinton's ability to cope with adversity. In related news, the NYToff-lead explains how the scandal could shift election-year politics: ifAmericans' disgust translates into low voter turnout, the Democrats willprobably suffer. A LAT front-pager recaps the long list of legalprecedents set in the case.            Trouble in Congo gets front-page play at the LAT , and runs insideelsewhere. The U.S. embassy there was closed yesterday, and the last Americandiplomats were evacuated as the teetering Congoese government prepares tocounter advances from Rwanda-backed rebels. The WP adds this to thestory: Western troops (including some 1,200 U.S. Marines) are taking uppositions near Congo's coast in order to rescue foreigners if necessary. TheCongoese take an understandably dim view of this move--very few foreignersremain in Congo.            Front page pieces at the NYT and WP report new developments inthe search for suspects in the African bombings. An NYT front-pagearticle, citing federal law-enforcement officials, says that an associate ofwealthy Saudi exile and terrorist financier Osama Bin Laden has been"tentatively linked" to the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The WP 'sfront-page story pursues another angle: A bombing suspect was arrested on thePakistan-Afghanistan border while travelling under a false passport, and isbeing flown to Kenya for questioning.            A NYT "Week in Review" article urges the U.S. to develop aconsistent, long-term policy to combat terrorism. The writer, a long-timeintelligence officer, observes that, "Most of our counter-terrorism successesare against loners." He decries quick fixes such as assassination because theyeither backfire by perpetuating the cycle of violence or aren't comprehensiveenough. A better strategy, he argues, would involve gradually undermining andweakening terrorists' bases.            According to a below-the-fold NYT front-page article, someheavyweight web sites like Geocities, Lycos-Tripod, and Ticketmaster haveagreed to feed subscriber information to a tracking system. This informationwill then be sold to advertisers, who can tailor their marketing strategiesaccordingly. While this does not violate individual anonymity per se, theprospect irks privacy-rights activists. Their battle may be tough, however,since privacy regulations on the Internet remain notoriously nebulous.
