                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        It was a mood-swing week on Wall Street, though I don't think there's anyoneleft out there who feels confident enough to tell you what the market's goingto do next. (Well, it will fluctuate, of course.) Beaten down by last week'sproducer price index number and the myriad misreadings of Alan Greenspan's comments, stocks came roaring back thisweek after the consumer price index for September was reasonable and Microsoftreported blowout numbers--no doubt all due to                   Slate               , in somecomplicated way that not even we can fully comprehend. But then IBM came in onWednesday night with a melancholy forecast for the next six months, which sentstocks tumbling for much of Thursday until they just stopped. It was actuallyan impressive feat of discriminating between good and bad stocks on the part ofthe market, instead of the perhaps more common "Kill 'em all and let God sort'em out" approach.            I hope nothing else important happens between the time I write this and youread it, but if it does, just ask the closest 7-year-old about it. He'llprobably give you a version much like the one in the previous paragraph. Andso, on to the Cocktail Chat!            1. "AOL announced that it would be investing $800 million in PC makerGateway , and that it would be entering a partnership with Gateway thatshould give AOL easier access to people who buy Gateway PCs, and Gateway easieraccess to AOL customers.

"Think of that as a Henny Youngman joke for the age of the NewEconomy."            2. "IBM met Wall Street estimates but saw its market capitalization dropby a staggering $40 billion after it warned that its sales in the next twoquarters, well into next year, would be sharply lower because customers are soworried about the Y2K problem . Curiously, other tech giants, like SunMicrosystems, Microsoft, and EMC have said that Y2K concerns are having littleor no effect on their business. But this does raise an interesting question:What will be the latest date that a company mentions Y2K as a reason for poorperformance? I'm guessing July 2002."            3. "Tobacco companies' stock prices dropped yet again, with Philip Morrisplummeting 24 percent in two days and R.J. Reynolds falling 15 percent.Director Michael Mann must be astonished at the powerful effect theearly screenings of his anti-tobacco-company movie The Insider have had.Though it's possible that a Florida jury handing down a verdict in aclass-action suit that could mean the companies will be shelling out even moremultibillion-dollar payments might have something to do with the downturn."            4. "Gillette, which in the past year has made a habit of letting WallStreet down , did so again Thursday when it announced that sales in the nextquarter would be lower because it was going to trim its inventory of razorblades . Gillette also said it was contemplating selling off some of itspoorly performing divisions. Reuters reported that Gillette's shares were'bludgeoned' in after-hours trading. Presumably with a 'blunt, heavyobject'?"            5. "A bus-stop ad for a personal-injury lawyer here in Brooklyn tellspotential clients to call this number: '1-877-I-CAN-SUE .' Doesn'tMatlock have that on his business card, too?"            6. "Martha Stewart Omnimedia went public Tuesday and nearly doubledin its first day of trading, after some dubious trading shenanigans in itsfirst hour. According to the New York Times , 'The offering was hot inlarge part because the founder of the company is so well known .' Ah,yes. I'd almost forgotten that legendary chapter in Graham and Dodd'sSecurity Analysis : 'On the Importance of Fame in Valuing Stocks.'"            7. "Drug maker Eli Lilly saw its profits rise 15 percent in the mostrecent quarter, meeting estimates, but its shares fell nonetheless when itannounced that Prozac sales were down significantly. Count depression asyet another casualty of the booming U.S. economy."
