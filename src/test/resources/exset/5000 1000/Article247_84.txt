                                 Dish of Currie!            Chatterbox hears that the lawyer for Clinton secretary Betty Currie wasirritated that President Clinton overplayed Currie's initial denial of the Feb.6 New York Times story regarding her testimony before Kenneth Starr'sgrand jury....If you recall, Lawrence Wechsler, Currie's attorney, issued astatement saying she was not "aware" of any legal or ethical impropriety.Apparently the idea (see Chatterbox for 2/18) was to leave open the possibilitythat others might interpret the facts, as Currie told them, to involve animpropriety. Clinton immediately seized on the statement and declared to thepress that he was "pleased that Ms. Currie's lawyers statedunambiguously--unambiguously--that she's not aware of any unethicalconduct."... Since Clinton also used the "aware" fuzzword, it's not clear whatWechsler found so irritating. Perhaps he was more annoyed at White Housespinners, who turned Currie's statements into a denial that she' d been in anyway coached....But, hey, if Wechsler is irritated, Chatterbox isirritated....                           The big question in Washington at this point in time: Did Clinton useJesse Jackson to "get to" Currie and convince her not to contradict thepresident in her testimony?... Jackson was the one who contacted Currie whenpanicked White House officials couldn't locate her early in the scandal. (Shewasn't at work because she was testifying to Starr!) Today's WashingtonPost says Jackson "has provided spiritual counseling to Currie...in recentweeks." Last Friday's New York Times reported that Jackson "seemeduncomfortable when asked about his relationship with Mrs. Currie"....ButJackson is also quoted in the Post as doubting that Currie would haveacted on her own volition when she asked Vernon Jordan to get Monica Lewinsky ajob. That tends to undermine Clinton's case... Is Jackson actually planningSister Souljah's revenge?...                           All the heat on Currie makes Chatterbox think: Was the sprawling,seemingly loony essay by Henry Louis "Skip the Truth" Gates Jr. in last week'sNew Yorker (see Chatterbox for 3/3) actually a far morenarrowly-targeted appeal than Chatterbox thought--specifically, an appeal forCurrie to lie for Clinton, much as Rose Mary Woods (the heroine of Gates'essay) is thought to have lied for Nixon?... Sorry, Skip! Chatterbox's sources(like everybody else's) say that nobody who knows Currie thinks she'll lie forthe president. Clinton spinners have also portrayed Currie as incorruptible.They may, to their regret, be right...                           Chatterbox has also learned that Currie once told friends PresidentClinton and his wife lead such separated lives that the president only learnedHillary was testifying before Starr's grand jury when he saw it on TV!...                           Oedipuss at the Excelsior! To gain new insight into the Paula Joneslawsuit, go buy a copy of David Maraniss' acclaimed Clinton bio First in HisClass . Turn to the second photograph, a weathered old portrait of PaulaJones.... Wait a minute, that's not Paula Jones. That's a photo of BillClinton's mother, Virginia Kelley!... The similarity is giving Chatterbox theFreudian heebie-jeebies, for the second time this month. (The first was thatbusiness about attorney William Ginsburg kissing the inside of baby Monica'sthighs.)... Those who say Jones is too unattractive to draw Clinton' sattention--the Oscar Wilde defense--should be forced to ponder the implicationsof this photo...                           Least Plausible Perjury Payoff Dept.: The Washington Postnoted ominously that shortly before Arkansas ex-judge Beth Coulson gave adeposition denying a sexual relationship with Clinton, the president "named herto a committee of Arkansas friends to come up with name recommendations for hisnew dog." ... Hey, honey, there's that and more in it for you if you keepquiet!... Personally, Chatterbox would have held out for ambassador toSwitzerland....
