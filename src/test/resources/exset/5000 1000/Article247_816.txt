                                 Trial and Error            Day 1 of the Senate impeachment trial leads all around. The coveragereflects the event's two contrasting sides: Austere formal procedures cloakingraucous partisan disputes. The LAT especially emphasizes the rigmarole, withthe top half of its story sprinkled with time hacks and scene-setting ("A fewminutes after 10 A.M., Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, leader of a 13-memberHouse GOP team that will present the case against Clinton, entered through thechamber's back double-doors.") and a top-front featuring a magisterial wideshot of Chief Justice Rehnquist swearing in the senators as jurors. But in allthe papers the in-fighting eventually prevails--it may be a very old sausagerecipe, but they're still making sausage. The House managers and many SenateRepublicans want a plan that allows the calling of witnesses, while mostDemocrats and the White House want one that does not. The attendantcomplications make it seem that this could well turn out to be the trial oftwo centuries.            At times the papers' tick-tocks descend into such inside baseball that it'sunfathomable that they're of any interest to any reader who's not a member ofthe Senate. Thus we find the NYT reporting, "At this point Daschle saidhe was learning for the first time, in phone calls from puzzled Democrats, thathe was being blamed for blocking the bipartisan caucus. 'I was flabbergasted,'Daschle said. 'I didn't know about any plans for any meeting.'" The leadershipfinally agreed to a closed meeting today of all 100 senators to try and ironout the trial's procedural rules. None of the papers, by the way, explains howit can be that the entire Senate can go into closed session. What is there toprevent the Senate from doing the whole trial in closed session? Or for thatmatter, all the rest of its business? The papers don't say.            The UNSCOM/US espionage story, broken two days ago by the WP andBoston Globe , appears to have legs. The NYT front says the U.S.government admitted Thursday that a U.S. spy went into Iraq in the guise of aUN weapons inspector and left an eavesdropping device behind that for tenmonths allowed the U.S. and "a select elite" within the UN team to monitor thecommunications of the officers who protect Saddam Hussein and conceal hisweapons of mass destruction. The LAT runs a front-page story on thematter that says the government denies that it ever placed spies on the UNSCOMstaff, although the story also says the take of the eavesdropping operationalmost certainly helped the Pentagon plan last month's bombing campaign. Thatpaper adds that the exposure of the gambit is thought by some diplomats to havehanded Iraq a short-run propaganda victory.            The papers don't really get into it, but it's hard to see how this use of aninternational body with special privileges is any different than say Saddam'suse of hospitals to house bioweapons production, or the already widely acceptedpractice of the U.S. military relying on the information provided byBaghdad-based TV crews to monitor its air offensives. In short, everybody inthe Iraq situation has exploited "dual-use" technology for privilegedinstitutions. The only difference that could justify approval of U.S. dual useand condemnation of Iraqi dual use is that Saddam is evil and the U.S. is not.If this point is accepted, the controversy disappears and if not, then why isthe U.S. taking steps against his weapons it's not taking against say,China's?            The USAT "Money" section front reports that AT&T and Microsoft haverecently discussed an AT&T buyout of the latter's media properties,including the Microsoft Network ISP, the MS portal Web site and Slate .In return, says the paper, MS would want money from AT&T and also a deal tohave AT&T promote Windows NT software. (And to have Paul Risor killed.)USAT says that although Bill Gates has held talks at his house regardingthis matter with AT&T execs, the phone company has since cooled on the dealbecause "it may not want to be an owner of Microsoft's money-losing Web sites."Sniff.            The WSJ "Washington Wire" reports that in an email recently, the U.S. AirForce general in charge of enforcing the northern Iraq no-fly zone wrote "It'sa good day for bombing." The paper says he "exulted" in saying this. What proofis there of this? The paper doesn't say. And it needs to, because the statementis one that could be made quite straightforwardly (as part of a briefing, say),by a military professional without any untoward implications, like "It's a goodday for driving."
