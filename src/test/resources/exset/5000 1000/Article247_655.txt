                                 Kenya Catch Them?            The Washington Post , USA Today ,and the New York Timeslead with the investigation into the African bombings. The Los AngelesTimes comes behind its lead about the passage of the California statebudget with the report that some suspects have been arrested in the Tanzaniaattack, a story included in the other bombing leads. The NYT andLAT quote a U.S. official lowering expectations about the arrests, asdoes the WP , which goes on to identify the arrested men as Iraqis ofSudanese extraction.                           USAT says a Kenyan guard confirmed to a local paper--what was firstreported in yesterday's WP --that there was a brief battle at theembassy's back gate that killed several guards before the bomb went off.Apparently, the guards' resistance kept the bomb vehicle--now described by thepapers as a small pickup truck--from gaining access to the embassy'sunderground garage, where it probably would have caused even more death. TheLAT interviews another witness to the attack who says the man who jumpedfrom the bomb truck was dressed in the uniform of an embassy security guard.This observation that a man jumped indicates a point not made expressly in anyof the coverage, namely that this was not a suicide bomber.            The LAT also describes international tension at the Kenyan bomb site:the Kenyans are angered by the slow pace of the body recoveries and the Israelirescuers are miffed at being watched closely by U.S. officials, who, the papersays, are seemingly worried that their allies might use the occasion to siftthrough classified materials.            The papers say that rescuers continue on the trail of faint noises in thehopes of finding survivors-- USAT dedicates its news section cover storyto the ongoing hunt for "Rosie," the last unaccounted-for person contactedalive inside the rubble. And the Post notes a special problem inidentifying the forty-some unknowns still in Nairobi morgues--few Kenyans havedental records because few can afford to go to the dentist.            Meanwhile, investigators have begun sifting for bomb parts. The NYTsays they currently suspect plastic explosives, perhaps from a lot sold toLibya by Czechoslovakia in the 1970s or 80s. The papers also report( USAT reported it yesterday) that the U.S. has announced a $2 millionreward in the case. The NYT says that in the 1990s, the U.S. has paidout more than $5 million for anti-terrorist information.            The WP reports that at the Nairobi airport as Marines escortedAmerican bodies onto a transport plane, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, PrudenceBushnell, herself injured in the attack, stood by with "a bandaged hand overher heart and tears glistening on cheeks cut by flying glass."            The NYT off-lead is a disturber that also gets frontcoverage at the LAT and an inside mention at the WP : in Chicago,two boys, one age 7 and one age 8, have been charged with murdering an11-year-old girl, apparently to steal her bike. They also sexually molestedher. The paper says the boys have confessed to the July 27 killing. TheTimes says experts think these are the youngest murder defendants inU.S. history. According to their confessions, the older boy afterwards rode hisbicycle home and watched cartoons, and the younger boy went home to play withhis puppy. One glaring lacuna in the coverage: the accused killers' parents.They are hardly mentioned although they have obviously done a horrible job.            A Wall Street Journal front-page feature says that theKenneth Starr report to Congress will likely conclude that President Clintonhad a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, wasn't candid about it underoath, and at least tacitly encouraged others to give false testimony about it.And, says the Journal , Starr will conclude therefore that Congress hasno choice but to debate Clinton's fitness to remain in office. But in a letterto the editor, a WP reader makes a worthwhile alternate suggestion: Congress should pass a joint resolution of censure of the president'sconduct. This would get Clinton's questionable behavior on the record whilesparing the nation the immense distraction of impeachment proceedings.
