                                 Resisting the Urge To Merge                        Although the past few years have given us a boom in mergers and acquisitionsthat rivals anything we saw in the '80s or the go-go years of the '60s (whenconglomerates became all the rage), this boom has been distinct because thevast majority of takeovers have been friendly rather than hostile. One wouldlike to believe this is because executives have realized that hostile takeoversonly magnify the immense problems any company faces in trying to assimilate theoperations of another, but it almost certainly has as much to do with the loftyprices that are being offered for companies these days. (The more you'reoffered, the less important independence seems to become--and rightly so, forthe most part.)            In any case, one consequence of this epidemic of friendliness is that youdon't hear the expression "X company is now in play" all that much anymore.This expression was a staple of business thinking in the '80s, and wasepitomized by the experience of RJR Nabisco, which became the subject of a hugebidding war after its management tried to take the company private in aleveraged buyout. A company came into play when a buyout or acquisition offermade the possibility of an acquisition suddenly seem likely, bringing otherpotential suitors--or sharks, depending on your metaphor--into the fray.            Last week, then, Sprint came into play, when MCI WorldCom made a friendly$93 billion offer to acquire it. Actually, we didn't know that Sprint had comeinto play, since the company's board looked kindly on MCI WorldCom offer andwas, by all accounts, ready to approve it today. But this weekend, BellSouthstepped in to trump MCI WorldCom (which, full disclosure, I own shares in) witha $100 billion bid, and Sprint was officially on the block.            But Sprint, like any public company that isn't controlled by a small groupof shareholders, was always on the block. And that makes the whole ideaof a company suddenly being "in play" dubious. BellSouth has had years(effectively, ever since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed) inwhich to make an offer for Sprint. At any point along the way, it could havedecided that merging with Sprint was in its best interests and bid. And if ithad done so a year ago, or even six months ago, it almost certainly could havegot a better price. Sprint was no more in play after the MCI WorldCom offerthan before. Its status had not changed. Only BellSouth's urgency had.            The point is that the phrase "in play" is a useful cover for the fact thattakeovers, particularly hostile ones, are often the result of companies'panicking at the prospect of losing something they never even knew they wanteduntil they realized they might not be able to have it. BellSouth, for instance,has been singularly restrained in its approach to the merger-mania that hasswept the telecommunications industry. With the exception of a 10 percentinvestment in high-speed provider Qwest, BellSouth has been content to buildits business from within. But in the space of three days it has thrown thatstrategy over, in favor of a massive bid for a company that it will find verydifficult to integrate with, from both a regulatory and an operationalperspective. And it's hard to believe that this is really the way you buildshareholder value.            It's possible, of course, that BellSouth has had its eye on Sprint allalong, and was just getting ready to pounce when MCI WorldCom beat it to thepunch. But forgive me if I'm skeptical. You can't conjure a takeover bid out ofwhole cloth in a couple of days and expect to have done the due diligence asuccessful bid requires. And if we learned anything from the '80s, it's thatthere's always a horde of investment bankers ready to convince executives thatthey really can't afford to let this acquisition pass them by, and that there'salways a host of corporate executives eager to believe that bigger isnecessarily better.            The market, unsuprisingly, recognizes that the opposite is just as oftentrue, which is why the stocks of both MCI WorldCom and BellSouth have beendriven down since they made their respective bids. The urge to merge is apowerful one, but resisting it is usually the smartest course. Especially whenit's an urge that seizes you only after it seizes someone else first.
