                                 Israel Grieves            A wave of emotion swept theworld's press Monday following the death of King Hussein of Jordan, but nowheremore than in Israel. Maariv carried a huge picture of him under theheadline "Shalom, King," while Yediot Aharanot printed in Hebrew andArabic the words "Shalom to a friend." Eitan Haber, an aide to the late IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, wrote in Yediot Aharanot , "If they lay athousand flowers on your grave, one will be mine. ... If a thousand tears soakyour final resting place, one will drip from my eyes. ... I want to thank you,first and foremost, for the peace. And I have no doubt that Yitzhak Rabin joinsin these warm thanks. He is waiting for you with a soldier's handshake."            In Maariv , ChemiShalev also dwelt on the king's relationship with Rabin: "They were sodifferent, these two, yet they were very close. An introvert and impatientgeneral and a noble and generous monarch, whose objectives and souls joined."He imagined them "up there" together, lighting cigarettes for each other andtalking old soldiers' talk. Also in Maariv , Yosef Lapid wrote thatHussein might have made two grave mistakes--in 1967 when he joined Egypt'sabortive attempt to destroy Israel, and in 1990 when he supported SaddamHussein's invasion of Kuwait--but he was nevertheless "the only Arab leaderIsraeli citizens saw as 'an enemy who became a friend.' "            In Ha'aretz , Danny Rubinstein, an expert on Palestinian affairs,contrasted Israel's outpouring of grief over the king's death tothe relative indifference of the Palestinians. There are no special signs ofmourning among the Palestinian public, he wrote, quoting a man in an EastJerusalem coffee house: "Netanyahu is sadder and more concerned than we are."Rubinstein said that the merchants of East Jerusalem were principally concernedabout the weekend's fall in the value of the Jordanian currency, the dinar, inwhich they kept most of their savings. And he noted that in Gaza and Nablus inrecent days there has been more pictures of Saddam Hussein on display than ofthe Hashemite king.            Other comment Monday inthe Israeli press focused on the aftermath of Hussein's death and Jordan'sprospects under King Abdullah. In Yediot Aharanot , Danny Rothchild, aformer intelligence officer of the Israeli Defence Forces, predicted that thetransfer of power in Jordan will take place "without many shocks" but thatthere will be hard times ahead for the Jordanian people. The Jordanian economyis in a deep recession, he wrote, and will get even worse unless the Jordaniangovernment urgently tackles unemployment, the stability of the currency, andthe trade balance. Another urgent problem is the country's water shortage, headded, "If they do not solve it immediately, a drought in the summer will leadto intolerable dependence on Jordan's neighbors."            Rothchild wrote that the "external threat" to Jordan doesnot seem especially grave at the moment, though there is the risk of Iraqisubversion with so many Iraqi exiles on Jordanian soil and at its borders. Buthe said the new king will have to focus a lot of attention on preserving calmwithin the royal family, which until now has been kept in order by Hussein,with his absolute authority and "almost obsessive" concern for the maintenanceof family unity. On Jordan's relationship with Israel and the continuation ofthe peace process, Rothchild urged that King Abdullah be allowed to deal withother problems first. "All those with the welfare of the king and his kingdom,as well as ours, at heart would do well not to force him to confront thesecomplex and sensitive issues at this time," he wrote.            Writing forHa'aretz from Amman, Zvi Bar'el noted that aJordanian publicist had dubbed King Abdullah "a king for the Internet age" andsuggested this might make his relations difficult with veteran Arab leaderssuch as Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Hafez Assad of Syria, and King Fahd of SaudiArabia. "Won't he have to prove that his Arab credentials are no less solidthan theirs?" he asked. But in the new king's favor, Bar'el pointed out that hewas the first Jordanian monarch not to be weighed down by the trauma of losingnational territory, the first Arab leader not to have taken part in fatefuldecisions about Iraq, and someone for whom peace with Israel was a givenreality that did not need to be justified.
