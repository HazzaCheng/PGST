                                 Keeping Up With the Bushes            The Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes lead with the grisly massacre of 14 Serb farmers in Kosovo,reported by the latter paper yesterday. The New York Timesfronts the story as well. Each of the papers marks this as the worst attack yeton the province's Serbian holdouts, and predicts that it will spur even moreSerbs to flee. The KLA has denied the killings, and the NYT andLAT nod that no suspects have emerged. But an anonymous U.N. officialconfides to the Washington Post that a local KLA cell is responsible.The WP story, headlined "Serbs Killed Within Earshot of NATO Troops,"stresses the proximity of Western forces and their inability to suppress thiskind of outbreak of violence.            The NYT lead reports that the Democratic Party, green with envy atGeorge W. Bush's well-stocked war chest, is on an all-out drive to soak up softmoney contributions. The Democrats' Plan A is to raise as much soft money aspossible; if they come up short, Plan B is to adopt a folksy,you-can't-buy-the-presidency spin. Not only is this approach disingenuous,suggests the article, but it's also hypocritical: President Clinton, Al Gore,and Bill Bradley are all nominally committed to campaign finance reform. TheNYT and WP both report that Bradley has already slammed Gore forhis unbridled pursuit of cash. The Gore camp, according to the WP ,responded with the old necessity defense, accusing Bradley of wanting to leaveDemocratic candidates "to fend for themselves."            The WP fronts a long account of how George W. Bush's midlife crisis,circa 1986, led to his acceptance of faith and embrace of politics. The story,sourced to Bush and some of his closest consorts, describes his former drinkinghabit in explicit terms ("if not clinically an alcoholic, Bush sometimes cameclose to the line," judges the Post ) and his cocaine use in implicitones (Says Bush, "I've told people I've learned from my mistakes-and I have.")A NYT "Week in Review" piece ticks off seven potential catastrophes thatcould jeopardize Bush's coronation as the GOP candidate-designate. Thescenarios: Bush could lose his temper, be skewered by Forbes-sponsored ads,remain hopelessly fuzzy on the issues, be resented for his vast campaign (andinherited) resources, get cocky, fall apart in an early primary, or be felledby a scandalous skeleton rattling in his closet. Meanwhile, a piece inside theNYT puzzles over former President George Bush's newfound popularity inGOP circles. After 1992, Bush Sr. was ostracized for running a lousy campaignagainst Bill Clinton, but today he is basking in newfound admiration. Thearticle mentions that Bush Sr.'s glow of popularity has rubbed off on his son,but never considers that it might be the other way around.            Another WP front-pager reports that China has arrested over 4,000Beijing residents in its efforts to suppress the Falun Gong sect, making thisthe largest government crackdown since the days of the Tiananmen Squareuprising. A front-page NYT piece posits that Chinese are flocking toFalun Gong because they're worried about China's stalled economy. The articledoes an excellent job of describing the potential burden of China's size: "Witha population of 1.3 billion that expands at 1% a year, the country must add atleast 7.5 million jobs a year just to absorb the people entering the laborforce," it explains. Unemployment currently ranges from 10 percent in thecities to 30 percent in more remote areas.            The NYT                Magazine cover story frets about a future whenparents will select their baby's gender. An experimental process dubbed"Microsort" separates sperm carrying X chromosomes (which create girls) fromthose carrying Y chromosomes, so that doctors can impregnate women with embryosof the preferred gender. Ethicists fear that the technique will furtherinstitutionalize sex discrimination.            It seems that the experts will have to revise their casualty numbers forboth the Kosovo conflict and the Littleton shootings. In the NYT lead,Democratic pooh-bahs whine that their spring fund-raising drive was stymied bythe Balkan war and the Columbine massacre, each of which caused PresidentClinton's to cancel potentially lucrative events. The fund-raisers grouse thatthese interruptions cost the party an estimated $6 million incontributions.
