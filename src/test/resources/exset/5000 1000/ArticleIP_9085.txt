Responsesto Monday's question (No. 146)--"Funny as a German Banker":                                       Fill in the blank.Rolf-Ernst Breuer, chairman of Germany's Deutsche Bank, may acquire America'sBankers Trust for $9 billion despite declaring, "Our motto is '__________first.' "                        "Our Teutonic sense oforder demands that we acquire a company starting with the letter 'A'first."-- Sam Coppersmith                        "Sell off the hedge fundsfirst."-- Steven Levy                        "Brat first."-- JenniferMiller ( Michael Gerber had a similar answer.)

You can be the birthplace ofHeidegger, Hegel, Leibniz, Bach, Beethoven, Brecht, and Martin Luther, but youstart one little world war ... OK, two.)"-- Chris Kelly                        Click for moreresponses.                           Randy'sWrap-Up                        Ask a German question, expecta World War II answer, which to those of us with delicate bourgeoissensibilities, risks trivializing the Holocaust. With sufficiently dark humor,any topic can be fair game. But the enormity here is so daunting. From onepoint of view--mine-- Apt Pupil is unacceptable because it uses theHolocaust as dramatic fodder for a lame and shallow drama, but Hogan'sHeroes is acceptable because its dimwitted POW humor steers clear of theHolocaust. Needless to say, this is not a position one could defend for verylong. It's a tough call, particularly given the good will of "News Quiz"participants.            Morecheering: The Anti-Defamation League's survey describes a continuing drop inAmerica's "hard core anti-Semites"--from 29 percent in 1964, to 20 percent in1992, to 12 percent currently. Clyde Haberman notes in the New YorkTimes , "The older and more poorly educated a person was, the more likely hewas to hate Jews." If only there were some kind of greeting card to send thesepeople, maybe--given their poor education--featuring a cartoon bear.                           DeutscheMarks the Spot Answer                        "Our mottois 'Europe first,' " said Rolf-Ernst Breuer last March, leading many to believethat Deutsche Bank would not expand into the United States. But Monday Deutscheconfirmed its $9.67 billion offer for Bankers Trust, a cash transaction thatwould create the world's largest financial services company, with over $800billion in assets.                           FreeSpeechless Extra                        Question: "They're really inthe vanguard of setting the agenda for the corporate culture along the lines ofthe radical gay movement." Who is?            Answer: Levi Strauss &Co., says William Donahue, president of the Catholic League for Religious andCivil Rights.            For an AIDS prevention event,Levi's planned to display a Christmas tree decorated with condoms at Wollmanskating rink in New York's Central Park, the well-known public space. Donahue'sgroup, the same organization that protested the opening of CorpusChristi , pressured the rink's managers into canceling the event. Withcharacteristic commitment to free speech, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani applauded thecancellation, calling the Levi's plan "one of the most idiotic ideas I've everheard of."
