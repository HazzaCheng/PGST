                                 More Comics, Less Sports                        Dear Steve:            Thanks for the encouragement to remain graphicallyinept. I've always theorized that cartoonists' drawing styles tend to suittheir temperament in the same way that singers' voices reflect their ownmessages. I mean, what if Johnny Lydon had wanted to become a lounge singer? Orwhat if Jewel was one angry bitch with a bad hair day and a gun to use on anyguy she despised? So maybe my workaday "style" fits my cranky, as you put it,outlook on life, I dunno. But I still would like to draw better, if for noother reason but to like the way my stuff looks more when I see it in print.Anyway, I suspect that maybe you're just trying to keep all the primo drawinggigs with yourself ("And another thing, Rall can't draw for shit!" Brodner toldhis editor over drinks at the 21 Club).            I'm glad you mentioned TheSimpsons , which is hands-down the best thing on TV ever. It's so great thatit's amazing that it was ever broadcast, much less promoted to the point thatit was permitted to gather an audience and eventually become successful. Butdon't diss Fox--I thought Married ...with Children (a live-action cartoon, really) waspure genius. The X-Files , well, obviously is great,though this business of preempting the season premiere in favor of baseball isstupid. Why can't baseball games be played and broadcast during the middle ofthe day, like in the old days? Any station that preempts news or otherprime-time programming for sports is irresponsible as hell. More to the point,spectator sports don't deserve coverage in any newspaper so long as they'recramming comics into one tiny page and skimping on the international coverage.Why they merit TV coverage at all is beyond me, but running baseball games onSunday nights is sheer lunacy. Back to Matt Groening, I was initiallydisappointed by Futurama , but now I realize thatit's not written for adults; it's really more for kids. The humor is moredownscale than The Simpsons , which is fine for itsintended audience. I guess I'd have to ask a kid whether they like it in orderfor me to form a decent opinion.            I like your Phil Harris theory of sexual politics a lot.It's true, you imagine that George Quincy is getting good sex--he certainlyappears relaxed for a guy who signs more death warrants for his state'scitizens in a day than I drink cups of coffee--but one wonders whether it'swith his wife. After what we've just been through post-Monica, I certainly hopeso. Speaking of which, I know it's a little late, but I'd just like to say thatI still think Clinton ought to have resigned the day in January 1998 that theLewinsky story broke, and definitive proof that I'm right was the sinking ofthe test-ban treaty that you like so much. No sitting president would havetaken such a beating on a foreign-policy front without having lost allpolitical credibility to the extent that Bill Clinton did after beingimpeached. He may have remained in office, but at what cost? He crippled Gore'schances of defeating Bush--who as a Republican is destined to lead America intoits next recession or depression, as the GOP always does--and he squandered twoyears of economic expansion during which really great programs might have beenenacted while we had the cash lying around. To those who say that privateconsensual sex is nobody's business, they'd be right if not for the fact thatClinton perjured himself under oath, which is obviously impeachable, and moreimportant, unforgivable. Anyone who's ever sat in a courtroom and watched somedirtbag lie with a straight face knows of what I speak.            As for Clinton, it's not too late to quit--dash off thatletter to Albright now, for Chrissake!            If this is it for this week's Breakfast Table, Steve,then it's been a pleasure solving the world's problems with you. And if this isnot it, see you tomorrow!            Very truly yours,Ted
