                                 Pre-Teen Follies                        Dear Christine--            All right, all right ... so maybe I exaggerated a little when I said youwere a Republican operative plotting Al Gore's demise when you ran into himoutside that Washington movie theater way back when. So I took a littleliterary license. Trust me, sister. The story works great when you're notaround to correct it with trifles like the facts.            I do remember the laughable panic that Washington plunges into every timethe city gets so much as a dusting of snow. But here in New York City, as youknow, the mindset is a little different. Here it takes the equivalent of apercussion bomb to get anyone's attention. Here, we don't chitchat much aboutthe weather or foreign policy or world peace. Every day is a Seinfeldepisode and, even when it's not, the tabloid headline writers try to turn itinto one. We're the hard-to-please connoisseurs of a unique local art form: TheTruly Weird Story.            Take today. Rather than waking up and remarking about the four inches ofsnow we received here overnight, the big story here is about the two officeworkers who were stuck in an skyscraper elevator that went on a 40-story freefall--only to screech to a stop near the fourth floor when the emergency brakekicked in.            Apparently, some rescue workers took an adjacent elevator to the place wherethe man and woman were stuck, took out the side panels that separated the twoelevator cars, then asked them to make a tightrope walk across a narrow beamthat spanned the shaft between the two elevators, as if these two poorknee-knocking souls were suddenly the second coming of Karl Wallenda.            They did it. But can you say 'intensive therapy'?            Another headline here today said Mia Farrow's son, Seamus, wants to enrollat Columbia next year. Even though he's 12. Apparently, he's already takingcourses at a small college at Massachusetts. I read that and thought I can'teven remember what I was doing at 12? Can you? I faintly recall jamming a fullpack of bubblegum into my mouth before every softball game I played. Andfalling asleep to baseball games that I listened to on a transistor radio Ismuggled to bed. And getting so dusty from playing outside all day that I couldwet my finger and write my name on my dirt-covered legs. Back then, my parentshad just bought us a homicidal pony named Yankee, and while I was trying toride him one day, he bucked me right over a three-rail fence. I landed in sometall grass with a thud.            Perhaps not surprisingly, years later I had to go to the doctor because of aback problem. I had a slightly cracked disk, and the doctor asked me how itmight've happened. And I thought about being launched off the horse and all theother stuff that happened that same year--the time I fell out of a tree in myneighbor's yard, the time I fell 20 feet from a hay loft and landed unhurt on abarn floor covered with straw; the time I wrecked a minibike or fell into aravine after trying to swing one-handed on a tree vine, like I'd just seenJohnny Weismuller do in a Tarzan movie. I also fell smack on my head in gymclass when a classmate forgot to hold my legs onto the uneven bars as Ipracticing a gymnastics maneuver called a "Flying Eagle." I couldn't turn myhead for a week.            So just as I'm about to tell my doctor, Leopold, all this, she's staring atthe X-ray and absently says, "You know, 90 percent of these back problems arehereditary."            So that's what I was doing at age 12. I didn't even know the word"matriculation."            Gotta run now because the TV news has just started a story about the policeapprehending "Soccer Guy"--this sidewalk bandit who distracted tourists bybreaking into a soccer-ball-handling routine, then circling and bumping themuntil he'd pickpocketed their wallets. As local lore goes, it doesn't match theall-time classic ("Headless Body Found in Topless Bar"). Nor does Soccer Guyseem like an appellation that's likely to go down in the annals of crimealongside Sammy the Bull--or even Paulie Walnuts, that hit man on theSopranos.            But, as in Washington, on snowy days like this, you take what you canget.            Stay warm,Johnette
