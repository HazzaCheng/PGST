                                 The SEC's Battle Against Selective Disclosure                        Sometimes a situation seems so obviously wrong that you can't believe it'sallowed to continue. Then someone--like, say, the Securities and ExchangeCommission--comes along and says the situation won't be allowed to continue,and a host of opponents spring up to say, unbelievably, "Things are just finethe way they are." To which the only reasonable response, of course, is to say,"Who are these people?"            This is pretty much the story of the SEC's battle against the selectivedisclosure of significant financial and business information by companies toinvestment bank analysts and large institutional investors, who routinely getlooks inside companies and notifications of changes in future outlooks longbefore everyone else does. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has been publicly on theattack against selective disclosure for the past 18 months, and yesterday theSEC issued a remarkably measured proposal, Regulation FD, that simply stated inessence that companies would not release any "material information" privately.Instead of applauding the regulation, Wall Street looks ready to fight it.            From one perspective, of course, this is hardly surprising. Investment banksand brokerage houses built their businesses around their access to information,and their ability to get that information to their clients before it reachedanyone else. And while in theory that information could be--and sometimesis--the product of especially dedicated digging or sharp analysis, it's oftenthe product of a phone call to a chief financial officer, or comes from a vicepresident who lets slip that the fourth quarter is looking especially good. Ifyou give up selective disclosure, and create a truly free flow of informationbetween companies and all of their investors, then the possibility of makingeasy profits (either by getting in before everyone hears the good news, orgetting out before everyone hears the bad) disappears.            That's hardly an argument even Wall Street could use to defend itself. Soinstead what you hear is the classic "this will lead to a general chill oninformation" argument, which says that since companies don't want to put outpress releases all the time, they'll stop talking to analysts at all, for fearthat they'll be breaking the law. And since markets function best when there'smore information, the market will work less well if Regulation FD isratified.            The truth is, it's not clear that there would be any damage done at all ifcompanies stopped having private conversations with analysts. The privilegedposition of the analyst, after all, is a vestige of the days when just aboutall investors had accounts with the major brokerage houses. In today's world,with the profusion of online brokerages, that's an unnecessary privilege. Atthe same time, if you look at analysts' estimates for companies' quarterlyearnings, they tend to be quite similar, which suggests that they're the resultnot of aggressive independent research but rather of company guidance. Ifthat's the case, then let the company give its guidance publicly, in aconference call accessible to the public, broadcast on the Internet, andtranscribed on the company's Web site. The same should be the case with anydisclosure of material information.            Regulation FD will work, though, only if it's followed up with a looseningof the rules on the kinds of public statements companies can make without fearof running afoul of either the SEC or minority-shareholder lawsuits. Eventoday, the SEC continues to limit the kinds of forward-looking statementscompanies can make, out of a desire to protect individual investors--whom itconsiders less serious and financially responsible--from potentially deceptivestatements. And the ability of lawyers to sue every company executive who makesa prediction that doesn't come true obviously keeps executives from makingpredictions that would be of great use to investors. Both of these phenomenaare legacies of Depression-era laws passed when Wall Street was purely aninsider's game and individual investors really were at a radical disadvantagein terms of separating truth from lies. But protecting individual investorstoday has the ironic effect of perpetuating their informational disadvantage.If we're going to have full disclosure, then we have to accept the risks thatgo along with it. So let companies speak and investors listen and decide fromthemselves, and cut out the middle men.
