                                 Newsweek to Faludi: All Is Forgiven!            Chatterbox was a bit surprised to see Susan Faludi's forthcoming book,Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man , get thered-carpet treatment from Newsweek . The magazine put Faludi on thisweek's cover, and inside ran a lengthy excerpt with no fewer than four sidebars (to read them, clickhere and here and here and here) and, to top it all off, an extremely sympathetic interview with the author. Perhaps Chatterbox wouldn't have beenso surprised had he known that Faludi recently became a Newsweekcontributing editor. But that's surprising, too.            Why? Because Faludi's hugely successful previous book, Backlash , was in large part an attack on, well,Newsweek . Backlash is remembered as a broadside against 1980sculture as a whole, and (to quote its subtitle) its "undeclared war againstAmerican women." That culture is represented in Backlash mainly throughthe news media, which (if you read the book quickly) comes off as uniformlyhostile toward feminism. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that somenews outlets come off worse than others. Faludi doesn't make a big deal ofthis, presumably because she never really intended Backlash to be acritique of particular news organizations so much as, well, a broadside againstthe culture as a whole. (That the culture as a whole quickly turned Faludi'sbook into a runaway best-seller has always suggested to Chatterbox thatBacklash's thesis was an oversimplification.)            According to Faludi's acknowledgements, Backlash began as a story forthe San Jose Mercury News's Sunday magazine debunking an unpublishedacademic study by David Bloom, a Harvard economist, and Patricia Craig, a Yalegraduate student, purporting to show that never-married college-educated womenfaced, at age 30, only a 20 percent chance of getting hitched in theirlifetimes. The findings became famous when they landed on the cover of Newsweek . Much of Backlash is dedicated to demolishing both theBloom-Craig research itself and Newsweek's further distortion of it-mostfamously, Newsweek's preposterous claim that a single gal was morelikely to be killed by a terrorist than to find a mate. Faludi writes that                                             [a] former Newsweek bureau intern who was involved in the story'spreparation later explains how the terrorist analogy wound up in the magazine:"What happened is, one of the bureau reporters was going around saying it as ajoke--like, 'Yeah, a woman's more likely to get bumped off by a terrorist'-andnext thing we knew, one of the writers in New York took it seriously and itended up in print."                                                      Newsweek also gets cuffed about in Backlash for decrying "theemotional fallout of feminism"; for hyping "cocooning," a trend pretty muchinvented by Faith Popcorn; for attacking the "myth of Supermom"; for runningtwo covers on the "trend of childlessness"; and for exaggerating the problem ofdrug addiction among pregnant mothers, among other sins. In many instances,Faludi's digs at Newsweek are actually somewhat unfair. (The conflictbetween women's traditional motherhood role and their increased participationin the workplace isn't just something dreamed up by newsmagazine writers.) Butthat isn't the point. The point is that an implicit theme running throughoutBacklash is that in a world plagued by stupid, superficial journalism,Newsweek is stupider and more superficial than most print outlets. Thatdoesn't make Faludi a hypocrite for becoming a contributing editor atNewsweek . Even if she thinks the magazine is no better now than it wasin the 1980s, she probably figures she'll help it improve. But look at thisweek's Faludimania cover package from Newsweek's point of view: They'reheaping laurels onto someone who's called them a bunch of sexist ninnies! Isthis an admirable show of open-mindedness, a pathetic demonstration of lowself-esteem, or inevitable mindless worship of whatever is "hot"? Perhaps a bitof each.
