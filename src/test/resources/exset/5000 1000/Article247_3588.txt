                                 Which Creation Theory?                        Last month, the Kansas Board of Education voted to remove evolution from thestate's required curriculum. The decision was a victory for those who favor atleast equal treatment for creationism. But several                  Slate                readers, responding to William Saletan'sFrame Game on the controversy, note that while thereis basically only one theory of evolution, there are many different theories ofcreation. Here are a few:                           Buddhism , unlike most religions, does not have a single creationstory. There is, instead, an endless cycle of creation, destruction, andrebirth. At the beginning of each kalpa (or era), there is nothing but waterand darkness. As time passes, land slowly forms on the water's surface. Theonly living creatures are spiritual beings who were reborn at the end of theprevious kalpa. Eventually, one of these being is tempted by the pleasures ofearth, abandons his soul-life, and takes on the form of a man. As othersfollow, they begin to experience the jealousy, desire, and misery of a physicalexistence (this is the period in which we are living). In time, the worlddissolves, returning all creatures to the soul-life and beginning the cycleonce again.            African creation stories are varied. The Fans --a Bantu tribe--tell ofan imperfect creation. The god, Nzame, created the earth and populated it withanimals. Deciding that it needed a ruler, he made Fam, the first man. But Fambecame insolent, abusing the animals and neglecting to worship Nzame. So, Nzameburied the earth in soil and tried again--this time, beginning with a tree. Asits leaves fell, they became the animals and fish of the new world. Nzame thenmade a new, more humble man. Needing a family, the man created a woman from atree. Together, they had many children.                           Hindus also have multiple creation stories, though they are all seenas different reflections of Brahman--the uniting holy principle of Hinduism.The Rig Veda--a Hindu hymnal--describes creation through the gods' sacrifice ofPurusa, the primal man. Purusa was, at the time, the entire universe. When hewas sacrificed, his upper three quarters became the immortal heavens, and thelower quarter became the earth. The human castes came from Purusa, too: Hisarms became the warrior, his legs the commoner, and his feet the serf. AnotherHindu story describes the earth's origins in primordial waters. The seas, whichdesired to reproduce, made a golden egg. After a year, Prajapati--one of thedivine forms of Brahman--sprang from the egg. As he cried out, the sound of hisvoice resonating created the earth, the sky, and the seasons.            The Judeo-Christian Bible's book of Genesis recounts a story ofcreation ex                nihilo , or out of nothing. In the beginning Godcreated the heavens and the earth--a formless and empty mass over which Hehovered. Over the next five days, God improved His creation, adding day andnight, the sun and moon, the land and seas, and the plants and animals. On thesixth day, God created man in His own image: Adam was produced from dust, andEve from Adam's rib. God told them to reproduce and rule over the world'sliving things. Then, God rested.            The Navajo story is one of creation by emergence--that is, thatpeople slowly evolved from primitive creatures as they journeyed upward fromthe world's womb. There are six worlds in the Navajo story, four of which liebelow our earth, and one--a land of perfection and harmony--which lies above.People began as insects who inhabited the dark, watery first world. The insectpeople did not recognize sexual taboos, which angered the gods and led to theirexpulsion from each of the first three worlds. In the fourth world, the insectsbecame (or, according to some versions of the story, helped create) First Manand First Woman. The couple had five sets of twins whom the gods taught theskills they would need to survive in the fifth world. The family then climbed areed that brought them to the present earth. They created the mountains,weather, plants and animals they had known below. And they brought the gods upto join them.            Next question?
