                                 Advertising for Dummies                        One of the more remarked-upon trends in modern (actually, postmodern ,I guess) advertising is the reliance upon anti-ads, those commercials thatacknowledge the basic insincerity of the adman's project and which presumablyplease viewers by nudge-nudge, wink-winking them in a way that recognizes howphenomenally aware we are of advertising's attempts to ensnare us. Sprite's"Thirst Is Everything" campaign, with its faux pop songs touting the drink'smagical powers, is the most obvious example, and some days it feels as if we'reall living in the world The Monkees made.            The past few months, though, have given us an entirely new--and relativelyunremarked-upon--advertising trend, which might be called the "consumers aredumb as a post" phenomenon. The campaign for AT&T's "Single One Rate" planthus features Paul Reiser going around talking to people about how now everylong-distance call they make with AT&T will cost just 7 cents a minute,while those he talks to react with a mix of befuddlement and incredulity,peppering him with questions that show that they just don't get what7-cents-a-minute really means.            Similarly, Burger King's new radio campaign for its Cini-Minis centers on anannouncer trying to explain that Cini-Minis cost just 99 cents to a group ofpeople who ask questions like, "If I had 17 cents, could I get a Cini-Mini?"And Merrill Lynch's utterly bizarre television ads for its new pricingstructure/Internet strategy all feature Merrill customers who just can't quiteunderstand what this whole newfangled approach is going to mean, like the guywho tells his broker how much he'll miss her, even as she assures him thatshe'll still be around.            The Merrill campaign is by far the strangest exemplar of the trend, sincewhat the ads--which include one in which confused customers quiz a panel ofMerrill execs at a kind of town meeting--actually point out is both how dubiousthe whole brokerage business was to begin with and how potentiallydamaging the new pricing structure (which includes much lower commissions) willbe to Merrill's bottom line. But the principle in all these campaigns is thesame: The company is offering something incredibly simple and straightforward,but consumers just can't see it.            I think it makes sense to ask whether people really like being told howobtuse they are, because even if the ads work on some level to inculcate asense of superiority in the viewer--as in "These idiots don't know what7-cents-a-minute-every-day means, but I sure do! Ha, ha, ha!"--on a deeperlevel we are the people Reiser and those Merrill guys are talking to, and thinkof how troubling it is to be told that Paul Reiser understands something youdon't. So this aspect of the ads is genuinely perplexing. Usually, aspirationaladvertising doesn't include not being stupid as one of the aspirations it'smeant to inspire.            But there is something else going on in these ads, which is that they'reessentially a kind of reaction against data smog. The people in these ads havebeen confused by complicated pricing plans and service agreements with strangerestrictions. They've been trained to think that everything will be difficultand tricky. They're unable to see the purity of "7 cents a minute" even whenit's right in front of them. And in some way the ads are saying that simplicityis disorienting because we're too comfortable with complexity. It's like"Morning in America" all over again.            The problem is that this message is so simple that you can only hear it acouple of times before it becomes intolerable. I'm happy to watch ads thatremind me of my knowingness, if they're clever. But there's no way to do the"It's so simple it's baffling" ads cleverly, because the whole point of the adsis that cleverness itself is bad. (This is partly why the Merrill ads, whichseem to want to be clever, end up seeming weirdly self-defeating.) And thatwould seem to mean that this trend will be short-lived. Then again, Touchedby an Angel is a Top-10 show. So who knows?
