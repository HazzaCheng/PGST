                                 Credit in the Cards?            The New York Times and the Los AngelesTimes lead with Saturday's meeting in Washington of the Group of Sevenindustrial nations. The Washington Post leads with next year's planned exodus of 33HMOs from Medicare.            The G-7 meeting resulted in a statement--described in the NYT 'ssecond paragraph as a "vaguely worded communiqu,"--which cites the world'sworsening financial problems and recommends "exploring" President Clinton'scall for extending emergency lines of credit to emerging nations buffeted byfinancial troubles. France and England have voiced support for Clinton'sproposal, but Germany and Japan maintain reservations. The WP 's insidearticle on the subject highlights Japan as the G-7 meeting's focus. AfterJapan's Finance Minister met with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in themorning, Japan unveiled its own $30 billion aid package for Asia. The Clintonadministration immediately criticized it as not addressing Japan's morefundamental need for bank restructuring--to which the Japanese Finance Ministershot back that the U.S. plan will never lift off unless a reluctant Houseapproves $18 billion for the International Monetary Fund.            The WP lead, a national story with a local focus, says that 33 HMOswill leave Medicare early next year because they are not recovering theircosts. (Thirty-one other HMOs are withdrawing in selected areas.) Thisdevelopment will force almost 250,000 patients nationwide either to enroll in adifferent Medicare-covered HMO, or to switch to a standard, more expensiveMedicare plan. Yet even as so many HMOs pull out of Medicare, there areconcurrently 25 HMOs hoping to expand their Medicare involvement and still moreHMOs with applications pending.            A WP front-pager explores the tangled web of geopoliticalrelationships around Azerbaijan's massive oil reserves (which could potentiallyproduce 3 million barrels of oil a day). Maneuvering around countries such asRussia and Iran, both with vested interests in the region, is among thebedeviling challenges for big U.S. oil companies and for the ClintonAdministration.            All papers run stories on Sunday's elections in Brazil, in which incumbentPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to triumph handily despite thecountry's economic turmoil. Described by the LAT as "one of thehemisphere's most impressive presidents," Cardoso is seen by voters as the onlyrealistic person for surmounting the financial crisis which has seen Brazil'sstock market plunge 41%. Among the alternative candidates: a left-wingpolitician expected to get one-quarter of the vote and, more exotically, an"excitable surgeon known simply as Eneas, who calls for Brazil to build anatomic bomb" (in the NYT 's words).            The NYT runs an op-edby Gerald Ford. Breaking his silence on the Lewinsky scandal, the formerPresident asserts that President Clinton "has broken faith with those whoelected him." Ford proposes the following punishment: "A harshly worded rebukeas rendered by members of both parties," to be administered in the well of theHouse chamber. "Let it be dignified, honest, and above all, cleansing," saysFord. As a NYT news article points out, Ford's op-ed represents apossible boon for the Clinton administration, since Ford is breaking rank withRepublicans who advocate impeachment.            The cover of the NYT "Book Review" (plus an inside WP "BookWorld" piece) is given to Philip Gourevitch's extraordinary book on the Rwandamassacres, We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With OurFamilies . Gourevitch's narrative demonstrates the "collective criminality"of Rwandan Hutus--neighbors hacking neighbors to death--as well as theall-too-familiar inaction of the U.N. The NYT reviewer, who notes thatclothed skeletons still litter the floor of one death-church-turned-memorial,fears that the rehabilitation envisioned by Gourevitch may yet be a long wayoff.
