While Tinky Winkymay be queer and proud, and while Tinky Winky might be your best fantasy andyour worst nightmare, that's not the why Americans are shaking their heads.            Personally, I couldn'tcare less if Tinky Winky or Bert or Batman is gay. What does offend me is thatbigots such as Falwell and other Christian right-wingers feel the need to"save" our children from supposedly evil influences, such as gay Teletubbies.If a gay Teletubby teaches tolerance and acceptance to children, that's a goodthing. What we should be afraid of are Falwellian bigots who preach hate anddivision.                           --Tyler Green                        Washington                                             RealNumbers                        I am writing from Brazil where the statements byPaul Krugman about Arminio Fraga in the to "Don't Blame It on Rio ... OrBrasilia Either" have been front-page news for a week. While I am pleased thatyou have published to Krugman's note, I am distressed to see that                  Slate                has not taken responsibility for its actions in the sameway that Krugman has.                   Slate               's editors must take a large measureof responsibility for this "baguna "--Portuguese for mess. As Krugmannotes in his apologies, he is an economist, not a journalist. Given theseriousness of the charges--trading inside information for the gain of Fraga'sformer employer--shouldn't                   Slate                offer Fraga an apology as well?Leaving Krugman to take all the heat of a very angry Brazilian public is not                  Slate               's finest demonstration of journalistic ethics.            The greatest tragedy ofthis episode is that of the Brazilian situation is one of the most positive andaccurate I have seen during the past six months. He makes clear what few havebeen able to--the vicious cycle of lack of confidence and interest rates. Iwish the public discussion of his article had focused on solutions to thedilemma he posed rather than on an extraneous appendage.                           --James R.Hunter                        LosAngeles                           War, Blockades,and Peace                        Broadly speaking, I agree with the points DavidPlotz makes in "." Congress has the sole power to declare war, and a bipartisanCongress and the president have cheerfully ignored that clear constitutionalfact. But I think Plotz may be mistaken in saying the recent Iraq bombingneeded authorization. As I understand it, the war between Iraq and the UnitedStates, begun in 1991, has not yet ended. The shooting war of 1992 ended with acease-fire, not peace. Indeed, in the years following, we have enforced ablockade on Iraq. Blockades have always been regarded as acts of war. And thecease-fire is conditional: if Iraq permits inspections, doesn't flyplanes in certain areas, and doesn't threaten our troops, then we willhold our fire. So, if the war was constitutional in 1991-92, the war is stillconstitutional now--nothing in the resolution specified a time limit.            Alas, the president hasnot made this case. Whenever Iraq claimed (quite rightly) that arms inspectionswere a violation of Iraqi sovereignty, we could and should have responded,"Bugger your sovereignty--this is war." Somehow, I can't imagine Clinton sayingthat.                           --AndrewSolovay                        Belmont, Calif.                           Diary of a MadProfessor                        I must say that the "" bythe anonymous assistant professor portrays the day-to-day stresses andanxieties of academic life through the eyes of a shockingly irresponsibleinstructor. The way in which the author views both graduate and undergraduatestudents reveals unhealthy personal insecurity. Teaching is a profoundlyethical vocation: Students entrust their emotional and intellectual well-beingto their professors, and those who command such authority must recognize theirresponsibilities to their students. The stresses of an academic are trulyheavy, but why should it be different from any other profession? Does theauthor think that teaching in the university involves a lighter load thanworking for a corporation? Why? Furthermore, the author is fortunate enough tohave a job when so many of the author's fellow humanities scholars are withoutemployment.                           --Jack W.
