Randy's Wrap-Up                        Many News Quizparticipants treated the top hat as a self-consciously anachronistic symbol ofthe rich. (The participants, not the hat, are self-conscious; although I'd wearmy hat more often if it were a little more self-aware.) But while the silk hatno longer invokes uptown swells, no other headgear has replaced it in ourmetonymy. Indeed, compared to the prewar wealthy, the contemporary rich have noapparent class markers. It is not just hats but entire wardrobes that fail todenote magnificent excess: The modern rich dress like business executivesduring the day and like pop stars at night, if indeed anyone is wearinganything other than sneakers and jeans. The opera house--natural habitat of thetop hat (i.e., the opera hat)--is no longer the preserve of the rich; it is, ifanything, a cathedral of gay culture. Nor have the rich maintained that audibleindicator, that quasi-English, quasi-lockjawed accent that the swells all hadin Depression-era movies. The rich now talk like everyone else, except DonaldTrump, who speaks as if taught by Diane Fosse. Not even the long limousineinspires a class-conscious hooligan to hurl a paving stone; the wise ragamuffinknows he's likely not seeing a mogul but some kids from Queens on the way totheir prom. In an ugly tux. And entirely hatless. But he throws it anyway.                           Stealing From thePoor Box Answer                        The United Way of America must pay William Aramony,its imprisoned former president, $4.2 million in deferred compensation.            Aramony, jailed forfraud and embezzlement after years of stealing from the charity, had a "tophat " pension plan, a grotesquely lavish package of benefits far richer thanthose offered to ordinary workers. Because his contract did not include a"bad boy "clause that would have revoked his benefits if hecommitted a felony, Judge Scheindlin ruled that the United Way must pay up.                           You Are What YouPerq Extra                        This actual e-mail wassent to everyone at Cond Nast. I intended to ask participants to devisesimilar but imaginary perqs that perfectly captured the ethos of other mediacompanies, but then I couldn't shake the image of Ved Mehta in spandex, so Ithink I'd better go lie down and put a cold compress on my forehead. Or down mypants. However, other examples of actual character-revealing corporate perqswould be most welcome.
