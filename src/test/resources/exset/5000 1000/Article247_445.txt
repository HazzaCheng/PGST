                                 Tiananmen Square-Off            The Clinton/Jiang summit is everybody's lead. A nuclear nonproliferationdeal was struck, as was a deal selling American-made airliners. But what seemsto make the biggest impression on the dailies was the extraordinaryshoulder-to-shoulder dispute over China's human rights record between the twomen at their joint press conference. Everybody reports that when Jiang defendedthe suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests as necessary to preserving hiscountry's stability, Clinton stated that on human rights, China is "on thewrong side of history." The Wall Street Journal points out that Clinton was similarlyforthright regarding China's trade policies, noting that he said right toJiang's face, "Just as China can compete freely and fairly in America, so ourgoods and services should be able to compete freely and fairly in China."            The LosAngeles Times calls the episode a "cordial but frank clash," but saysthe two countries have agreed not to let their continuing rights differencesstand in the way of strategic and economic ties. The New York Timessees things a little more starkly, saying that the public disagreement"appeared to broaden the gulf between the two powers on human rights."            Both the Washington Post and NYT report that the summitagreement for U.S. companies to sell reactors to China in return for China'sstand-down from helping Iran go nuclear was immediately denounced by somemembers of Congress. Yet neither paper explains what Congress can do about thedeal. The Journal does a little better, saying that Congress can"challenge" it within thirty days, but doesn't elaborate what form thatchallenge can take. Also, the Post says that the deal calls for China to"curb," and the Times says it calls for China to "abandon," its Irannuke program, but the WSJ explains that China agreed merely not toengage in any "new" cooperative programs with Iran, but will be completing twoprojects already underway there.            The NYT says the two leaders did, in private talks, discuss theallegations that China funneled illegal contributions in the 1996 election. Butapparently Mr. Clinton did not ask where Charlie Ya Lin Trie is. TheTimes also reports that at the joint press conference, when Jiang wasfirst asked about human rights, he checked his watch. And in search of clues tothe exact status of the Clinton/Jiang relationship, the Times closelymonitors Clinton's body language. Results: No grip of Jiang's bicep duringhandshake, but the leader of the free world did cop some elbow and back.            The WP , NYT and USA Today each report on their fronts that Iraq hasordered all Americans working for the U.N. arms inspection team there to leavewithin a week. The U.S. is considering a response and discussing the situationwith its allies.            The WP runs a cluster of articles today dealing with variousrevelations from the newest batch of Nixon tapes to see the light of day. Newlyexposed Oval Office Nixon no-nos include: early plans to destroy the tapes,thanking a supporter for supplying funds Nixon knew were being used as hushmoney for the Watergate burglars, a plot to "shakedown" the milk lobby for morecampaign contributions, and various schemes to interfere with the Democraticprimaries by creating spurious grassroots campaigns for Ted Kennedy and JesseJackson.            P.J. O'Rourke has an anti-Clinton screed on the NYT op-ed page today.What's new is his reason: to rail at many of his fellow conservatives fordrifting away from discussing the realities of the Clinton administration infavor of indulging in wacky conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary.            The WP , LAT , NYT and USAT all have front-pagerson the Clinton administration's decision to allow respondents to racial andethnic category questions on federal forms to, for the first time ever, checkmore than one block (the alternative of having a separate "multiracial" box wasrejected). If you feel the proliferation of such questions promotesBalkanization, the decision now gives you a legal way to fight back: Just checkthem all .
