                                 Who's Afraid of an Internet Tax?            Judging from the last two Republican presidential debates, the new big issuein this campaign is taxation of Internet commerce. Or rather, since none of thecandidates wants to tax Internet commerce right now, the issue is who ismost committed to extending the current congressional moratorium on taxingInternet commerce, which runs out in 2001. Writing in the Wall StreetJournal on Dec. 6, John Simons and John Harwood identified Internettaxation as a "21 st century wedge issue" for George W. Bush, whosays he wants to extend the moratorium but won't rule out Internet taxes in thefuture. In the zany context of the Republican nomination race, this makes Busha tax-and-spend liberal. Here's how Simons and Harwood explained Bush'spolitical dilemma:                                             The issue pits traditionally Republican Main Street business proprietorsagainst the highflying Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have contributed moreto Mr. Bush's campaign than any other. It also pits the GOP's vocal band ofantitax economic conservatives against many of the Republican governors whomMr. Bush is relying upon to support his primary campaign. ... The reason thatMr. Bush and his gubernatorial backers are loath to support a permanent ban isthey tend to rely heavily on sales taxes to fund their stategovernments.                                       The Republican governors, of course, have it exactly right. It's totallyunfair that Internet businesses can sell their wares without making customerspay state sales taxes, given that bricks-and-mortar stores are obliged to maketheir customers pay state sales taxes. A reasonable alternative totaxing Internet commerce would be for all 50 states to eliminate sales taxesaltogether and make up the lost revenue with increased or new state incometaxes. But don't hold your breath for Republicans (or even Democrats) toembrace that redistributionist solution anytime soon. (Indeed, OrrinHatch and Alan Keyes are headed in the opposite direction: They proposeeliminating the federal income tax and replacing it with a national salestax.)            In pressing for a tax-free Internet until the end of time, Bush's detractorsare ignoring or minimizing whatever costs that would impose on traditionalretailers. Check out this exchange (from the Dec. 6 Arizona debate on CNN) betweenJohn McCain, justly praised for being stirringly responsible on manyother issues in this campaign, and Orrin Hatch:                                             McCain: Orrin, you and I have worked on ... the Internet tax moratoriumact. As you know, this was stoutly resisted by governors, Republicans governorsas well. Don't you think we ought to make the Internet tax moratoriumpermanent?                                                      Chatterbox translates: "Orrin, don't you think governors in general,especially Republican governors of big states bordering New Mexico,Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana, are tax-loving jerks who would makebad presidents ? I would never say such a thing, of course, but perhapsyou'll do it for me .                                             Hatch: Yes, I really do. I really think that we ought to do it, because Ithink it's far overblown to think that the fact that people buy over theInternet is going to reduce mainstream USA. I think mainstream USA can competevery, very well.                              I mentioned [in the New Hampshire debate] last week, I asked my wifeabout that, I said: Elaine, what would you do if you could order everythingright over the Internet and have it delivered right to your home? She said: Istill want to go to the stores, I want to test things, I want to look at them,I want to enjoy it. I think she's not alone.                                                      Chatterbox translates: "Even though usually I'm a big Internetbooster, I am going to pretend now that Internet commerce will never amount tomuch. And I'm going to flatter bricks-and-mortar retailers by telling themthey're so powerful that they can subject their customers to my new nationalsales tax and still trounce the tax-free Internet! Whoopee! It's a goodthing I have no chance of getting elected!"
