                                 Max Senate Comedy            The impeachment trial continues to lead all around. Today's big story is theSenate's closed-door debate of a motion to summarily dismiss the chargesagainst President Clinton. The debate went until nearly 10 PM Washington timelast night and will continue again today. The secret session came about after amotion to hold all impeachment deliberations in open session was defeated. TheNew York Timeslead editorial calls the shuttered approach "an affront to the public."            The papers report that with the matter of whether or not to call witnesseshanging in the balance, much of yesterday was taken up by senators trying togin up a fast-track strategy that would bring the proceedings to a closeexpeditiously without witnesses. But, say the papers, none has the votes yet.And so the Senate Republicans are encouraging the House Republican managers tocut down their proposed witness list. The Washington Post says the House team appears ready to do so,with a list including Vernon Jordan, Betty Currie, and White House aides JohnPodesta and Sidney Blumenthal. The NYT says the House managers areleaning toward calling Jordan and away from calling Currie. The Postadds that there has been some interest in calling Dick Morris, whom the paperreveals, was debriefed by prosecution staffers on Sunday. But in the end, saysthe paper, such interest waned. One wonders why, given that the WP saysone of the things Morris had to say in his dry run was that President Clintonexpressed concern to Morris about the gifts he'd given Lewinsky.            The NYT , WP and Los AngelesTimes all report that Trent Lott submitted ten questions to PresidentClinton, and that the White House says neither Clinton nor anybody else therewill provide answers. The LAT sees the stonewall as a sign that Clintonis confident he'll win the case.            The papers report that one idea being kicked around by senators is one voteon whether the charges against Clinton are true and another on whether heshould thereby be removed from office. The NYT offers the bestexplanation of why this is attractive to Republicans: This would be a stringentform of censure, but the finding of facts would only require 51 votes, whichmeans it's doable.            Everybody fronts yesterday's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that the 2000 Censusmust be an actual headcount, not the statistical sampling that's alleged to bemore accurate. The main political impact of the decision is that it will affecthow many congressional seats each state gets, and perhaps will also affectwhich party's members occupy them, because the conventional wisdom is thatsampling favors Democrats, by being more able to include folks in cities andrecent immigrants.            The WP front reports that U.S. aircraft enforcing the no-fly zoneover southern Iraq fired missiles at an anti-air site and that Iraqi officialsclaim eleven civilians were killed when one of them went wide of the mark.Later, says the paper, the Pentagon acknowledged that a brand-new type ofvideo-guided missile may have missed its intended target and hit housesinstead. Significantly, the U.S. attack was preemptive, part of a toughereffort to suppress Iraqi anti-air activities without waiting for full-blownattacks against U.S. planes. USA Today fronts the Vatican's criticism of the U.S.campaign in Iraq, and the incident is inside at the two Times .            Another story receiving wide play--front at USAT and the NYT ,flagged in the Wall Street Journal news box--is Intel's decision to climbdown from its previous plans to ship its new Pentium III chip with the capacityto allow Web sites to identify a computer. The feature has been called "cookieson steroids," says USAT , inspiring privacy concerns among manynetizens.            The WSJ reports a new development in the music business in England,inspired by a recent rash of charges of song ripping-off--plagiarism insurance.Huge legal fees involved in successful defenses against such charges by thelikes of Andrew Lloyd Webber are cited as creating the market. Thepolicies--underwritten by Lloyd's of London--provide coverage for all damagesand defense costs in such cases. One special requirement: taking out the policymust be kept a secret, to avoid inviting lawsuits.            Today's WP answers some questions tendered here yesterday regardingthe financing for Monica's sudden blowing into town. Her travel expenses,including luxury accommodations at the Mayflower Hotel, are being paid by KenStarr until such time as she is called to testify at the impeachment trial.Then Congress pays for them.
