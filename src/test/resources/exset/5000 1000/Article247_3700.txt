                                 In Praise of Movie-Ticket Prices            Chatterbox loves to go to the movies. Mostly this is because he lovesmovies, but partly it's because moviegoers enjoy one of the last great consumerbargains in America. This is not widely recognized. Especially in New York City(where prices for movie tickets, and most other things, are higher than theyare elsewhere in the United States), politicians are constantly grandstandingabout the high price of movie tickets. In March, New York City Council SpeakerPeter Vallone issued a pressrelease urging the Justice Department to intervene because Loew's Cineplexhad just raised ticket prices in Manhattan to $9.50. Vallone kicked up asimilar fuss two years ago when Sony-Loew's New York Lincoln Square Multiplexraised prices to $9. A decade earlier, then-Mayor Ed Koch actually urged aboycott when movie-ticket prices rose from $6 to $7. (Click here toread CNN's coverage of the earlier controversies.) The boycott fizzled because... well, because, $7 wasn't all that much to spend on an evening'sentertainment in Fun City.            Chatterbox lives in Washington, where a Saturday night visit to what iswidely recognized as the area's spiffiest movie theater, an Art Deco palacecalled the Uptown, costs $7.75 ($9 if you purchase an advance ticket by phone).That's still "high" by national standards; according to the Motion PictureAssociation of America, the average movie-ticket price last year was a mere$4.69. Is that higher than it used to be?            Take a look at this chart, which Chatterbox found on a Web page about inflation thatwas forwarded to him and several other journalists by Jonathan Rauch,the economics columnist for National Journal . Observe that in constant dollars,movie-ticket prices more than doubled between 1935 (when they cost a quarter;that's $2.93 in 1999 dollars) and 1970 (when they cost $1.55; $6.68 in 1999dollars). Prices for movie tickets peaked, in constant dollars, during the1970s. By 1980, movie-ticket prices had dropped to about $2.69--$5.46 in 1999dollars, where they stayed until 1990. Constant-dollar movie prices dropped abit more in the early 1990s, stabilizing during the middle 1990s at $4.70 to$4.80 (in 1999 dollars), where they remain.            It's interesting to note that the 1970s, the decade when the price ofgoing to movies reached an all-time high, was also the decade when Hollywoodmovies were better , in the aggregate, than they've ever been before orsince. This was the decade of The Godfather , Chinatown , and more great films than Chatterbox can countby Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman. It's tempting to conclude thatif consumers paid more for movies, they would get better movies. But the 1980s,which produced movies that were worse in the aggregate than movies beingmade today (and much, much worse than the movies that were being madeduring the 1970s) would seem to disprove that hypothesis, because movie-ticketprices were higher then (in constant dollars) than they are now.            Perhaps the reason movies were so good during the 1970s had to do with thesize of the audience. According to data (not available, alas, online) from theMotion Picture Association ofAmerica, weekly movie admissions dropped from 78 million in 1946 to anall-time low of 15.8 million in 1971. Weekly admissions stayed in the teens formost of the 1970s, rising to the low 20s during the 1980s. (Chatterbox assumesthis has something to do with U.S. demographics.) Conceivably the shrinkagecaused the moviegoing public to become more like shoppers in a boutique thanshoppers in a supermarket--i.e., less interested in mass-produced items, andmore interested in quirkier handcrafted products. But if that's true, it cannotbe extrapolated that movies continue to get worse as audiences continueto expand . If that were true, movies would be worse today (weeklyadmissions numbered 27 million in 1997, the last year for which data areavailable) than they were in 1985 (when weekly admissions numbered 20million). But in fact, movies are better today (assuming you don't countEyes Wide Shut ).
