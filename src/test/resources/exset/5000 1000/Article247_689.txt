                                 Poll Tacks            The LosAngeles Times leads with its over-the-weekend poll indicating thatdespite the Starr revelations, the public's support for Clinton remains ratherrobust. USAToday 's off-lead provides its weekend polling, with a similar upshot.The New York Timeslead also looks at the popular reaction, summing it up as revulsion atClinton's behavior, but reluctance to put the country through impeachment.USAT leads with the political reaction to the Starr report, claimingthat over the weekend there was "no ground swell" in Congress for impeachment,although noting that prominent members from both parties called for censure ofPresident Clinton, (a Washington Post front-pager also notes the congressionaltrend, while a NYT front-page story says this is becoming moreacceptable to the Clinton camp as well). The WP , once again flashing itscommand of Beltway exits, leads with Sammy Sosa hitting two home runs to tieMark McGwire.            The LAT poll piece says just over 7 in 10 of those surveyed said theStarr report did not change their opinion of the president (of course, byitself, this means nothing, since they might have already thought he was anintern-bonking Mr. Hands). The poll also detects much public support forcensure--34 percent. Censure gets the nod from 60 percent of USAT 'ssample. A WP front-page story puts the censure rate at nearly six inten. These polls suggest a clear majority of Americans want Clinton to remainin office--but USAT 's finds that 50 percent would favor impeachment ifit could be proved that Clinton lied to the grand jury. Which is precisely what60 percent of those polled by the LAT think Clinton did. Wackiest stat:3 percent of the LAT sample say that after the Starr revelations, theynow view Clinton more favorably. The LAT story puts the size of itssample--968 people--and its margin of error--4 percent--in its seventhparagraph. USAT puts its counterpart info--between 449 and 631 peopleand 4-5 percent for various polls--in its last paragraph, the twelfth.            The NYT lead says at least 25 newspapers have called forPresident Clinton's resignation. That number is added to today in a significantway: USAT 's lead editorial says Clinton should quit because "a presidentwho puts his interests above the nation's cannot lead."            The WP reports the Sosa home runs drove the hometown Cubs fans wild but incontrast to McGwire's 62nd last week, there was no ceremony and no commentsover the public address system. In its Sosa off-lead, the NYT adds thatunlike with McGwire's record shots, baseball authorities had not putidentifying marks on the game balls Sosa hit out.            A WP inside piece reports that new Russian premier Yevgeny Primakov has pledged to turn his country towards a"socially oriented economy," which is being taken by some Russian reformersto mean a restoration of communist rule. Primakov stated his priorities includethe timely payment of salaries and benefits, and that it is unacceptable formost Russians to live below the poverty line.            The Wall Street Journal 's "The Outlook" is sounding what couldbe an early warning alarm for a new round of international economic crisis notrelated to the Asian turmoil. Several big British employers are laying workersoff because of falling exports caused by Britain's surging pound. The pound'srise, explains the WSJ , stems from Britain's decision to opt out of thecoming common European currency, the euro. The eleven euro countries wererequired to cut government spending and raise taxes, and Britain wasn't, withthe result that U.K. interest rates are very high. In addition, continentalskeptics about the euro have been buying pounds as a refuge.            The Post 's Howard Kurtz notes that the Starr report confirms a numberof Matt Drudge scoops: the existence of the semen-stained dress, the storyabout Lewinsky giving President Clinton oral sex while he was on the phone withDick Morris, the use of a cigar in sexual activity, and a Clinton-Lewinskytryst on Easter. But Kurtz still has to flash his guild card at Drudge and saythat being accurate isn't enough, a story still has to be well-sourced. Theresponse is obvious: How could Drudge have been so consistently right if hewasn't well-sourced? In fact, it's pretty clear from this list that his sourcewas someone in Ken Starr's office. Which is trouble for Starr, but not forDrudge.            A high tech executive quoted in the WSJ and a letter writer to theNYT make the same point: Congress passed a bill last year to keeppornography off the Internet and yet, on Friday quickly voted to put it on.
