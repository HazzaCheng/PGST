                                 Y2OK            The New York Times leads with themillennial coming, while the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post lead with the resignation (just after theFriday papers closed) of Boris Yeltsin. The chronological milestone dominatesboth the WP and NYT fronts. The former runs a huge "2000" atits top, while the latter goes for "1/1/00."            The NYT lead communicates the vast, unprecedented scope of the revel,noting besides the hometown $7 million bash attended by perhaps 2 millionpeople, an "around-the-world series of golden moments" in the Pacific, Asia,Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The overriding theme of the coverage is thesymbolic enthrallment of the planet from east to west and mercifully, the sheerglitchlessness of it all. The WP says the $500 billion spent worldwideon Y2K seems to have done the trick, although it would be just as plausible towonder now if most of the spending was ever really necessary. The LATincludes an "extra" front page that briefly notes Australian bus ticketingfoul-ups and South Korean trial summonses gone awry but which declares above itall in large pitch type "Millennial Mildness."            So taken are the papers with millennial matters and the other pressingstories, that none makes room on their front for the news that all the majorindexes ended the year/century/millennium in nosebleed territory.            Yeltsin's surprise departure from the world scene leaves Prime MinisterVladimir Putin as acting president and also the likely full-time successorafter the presidential elections that must take place within three months.Yeltsin, the papers report, said the new millennium required new leadership andhe appealed for forgiveness on his way out. Putin responded by signing an ordergiving Yeltsin immunity from prosecution. On a day that, according to thecoverage, saw Russian and American military officers jointly shepherdingnuclear missiles through Y2K, Yeltsin and Putin participated in a littletransition ceremony that centered on the handover of the suitcase that is usedto monitor a nuclear war.            The other big story, which everybody fronts, is the peaceful resolution ofthe Indian Airlines hijacking crisis. India traded safe passage for threeimprisoned Kashmir militants and the five hijackers for the safety of theplane's 150 or so passengers. It appears from the coverage that the Taliban,which controlled the overall situation of the plane sitting in Afghanistan, wasinstrumental in forging the deal.            There is some surprisingly wonderful stuff in the millennial coverage. TheNYT 's coverage of Hungary's celebration dryly mentions "a journalist"getting "belted" twice in a minute by a reveler and then hit again by another.Of course, in Times speak this means the reporter writing the story. TheWP runs 100 biographical sketches solicited from readers and many ofthem fascinate. TP's favorite: "My parents were activist, intellectual, MarxistJews. In the '50s they were blacklisted; in the '60s they worked for civilrights and painted an orange Day-Glo peace sign in our front window topublicize their opposition to the Vietnam War. They embarrassed the hell out ofme, and I swore I would grow up to be normal. But what's written in one's DNAcannot be denied. Thirty years later, I am a 46-year-old Jewish bisexualpriestess of eco-feminist witchcraft."            The NYT takes the occasion to fess up to a mistake in the way thepaper has been counting its issues. Seems that since Feb. 6, 1898, the paperhas been giving itself credit for 500 numbers more than it actually published.The mistake, the Times tells us, was discovered yesterday. By a24-year-old news assistant but, yes, with the help of a computer.            The papers report inside that George Harrison will recover from his stabwounds and that the man who inflicted them was charged with attempted murderand scheduled for psychiatric evaluation. Trivia Question: Why is GeorgeHarrison alive but John Lennon dead? Answer: because in England, a wack jobcan't get a handgun.            There's no sign yet of what the papers are going to call the decade justentered. Today's Papers favors "the noughties" or the "uh-ohs," but a letterwriter to the Times proposes another idea that merits consideration:"the e-decade."
