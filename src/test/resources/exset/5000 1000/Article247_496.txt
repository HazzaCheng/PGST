                                 Honey, They've Shrunk the Op-Ed Page!            The New York Timesleads with the latest maneuverings in the Unabomber case. The Washington Post goes with a new push to train workers forcomputer-related jobs. The Los Angeles Times leads with the U.S. effort to turnaround the Indonesian economy. And USA Todayleads with the cold snap that has left the Northeast U.S. with hundreds ofdowned power lines.            The NYT reports that after the chaos in the Unabomb trial last week,Justice officials were considering a new offer from Theodore Kacszynski thatwould, if accepted, deliver him from the death penalty. The Timesreports that by the end of the weekend, the new plea deal had been rejected.The story doesn't reveal until its eleventh paragraph that the new round ofnegotiations was first reported by this week's issue of Newsweek . Somejournalists defend this suppression practice on the grounds that such sourcingissues are only of interest to other journalists, and not the general reader.Well, if this were a good argument, then newspapers shouldn't use bylineseither (general readers hardly ever notice them), or at least should put themin the eleventh paragraph.            The WP , which credits (sister publication) Newsweek in thefourth paragraph of its inside Unabomber story, treats the new round ofnegotiations as still open.            The WP lead reports that the Clinton administration's computertraining effort will include millions of dollars in grants to fund educationalprograms, an Internet job bank and a campaign to glamorize computer-relatedprofessions. The campaign's goal, says the paper, is to remove the "nerd"stigma from the computer profession. (This is probably cheaper than actuallyremoving the nerds.)            The LAT lead reports that a high-level Treasury team's mission toIndonesia has the goal of meeting with President Suharto today to persuade himto carry out the economic reforms mandated by the IMF. The Indonesian rescuestory is also carried on the WP front and inside at the NYT . Thefurther weakening of the Indonesian currency is covered on the USATfront.                           Don't ask, don't type. The WP breaks an astounding story inside about how the Navy is attemptingto dimiss a sailor for homosexuality because his AOL profile, which doesn't usehis last name, states that he's gay. Apparently, when Navy investigators calledAOL to identify the profilee, AOL supplied the man's name. (Which is TimothyMcVeigh! No relation.)            The Wall Street Journal 's main "Politics and Policy" piecepoints to an emerging health care issue: given the increasing degree to whichHMOs make medical decisions, should they continue to enjoy limited liabilityprotection against malpractice? The Journal reports that Texas hasalready passed a law eliminating that protection, and that the bill'sarchitects are being consulted by politicians elsewhere.            Readers inclined to think of prostitution as a victimless crime areencouraged to read the first-rate piece about the international flesh market by Michael Specter onthe front of yesterday's NYT . Specter reveals that the latest trend isSlavic women, who are lured by false ads from the Ukraine in great numbers tosuch countries as Italy and Israel where whoremasters confiscate theirpassports and work them until they are arrested and deported. Complainers havebeen known to be thrown out of buildings or beheaded.            One linguistic quibble: the piece revives the old-fashioned term "whiteslave trade," which brings with it an unnecessary implication that slavery is aspecial insult to white women. Far better to go with "sex slave trade."            Today's NYT opinion page is defaced by another of the paper'spatented unfunny celebrity tryout pieces--this time by miniature actor RickMoranis. It's something about a future New York City where gambling is king andapparently every Vegas reference gets big laughs. Wouldn't you love to be a flyon the wall when these pieces get assigned? Who calls whom? And why?
