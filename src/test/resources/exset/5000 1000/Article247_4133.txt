                                 The Pornographer Who Didn't Bark            So, Newt Gingrich has been having an affair with congressional aide CallistaBisek for six years--since before the Republican Revolution of 1994. Why didn'tLarry Flynt tell us about it when it mattered? You remember: Flynt, thepornographer, and his crack team of snoops were going to blast the lid off thehypocritical Republican Congress that was trying to impeach a president oversex, etc. Flynt offered up to $1 million in reward money. Yet here one ofFlynt's juiciest potential targets was cheating, and Flynt didn't blow hiscover.            Did Flynt fail to find out about Gingrich and Bisek? No, according to AllanMacDonell, executive editor of Flynt's Hustler magazine. MacDonell toldkausfiles that "we had some information" on Gingrich--indeed,Hustler had compiled a "good dossier" on the speaker before he resignedhis office after the Nov. 1998 elections. Did that dossier include the Bisekmatter? "Yes." So why didn't Flynt expose the affair? "We were holding back."Why hold back? MacDonell said that Bisek was a "private" citizen, which causedsome concern, but also that Hustler "wanted to see what Gingrich wasgoing to do next as far as his career was concerned."            Hmmm. In early 1999, while the Clinton impeachment was pending before theSenate, Republicans charged that Flynt was blackmailing anti-Clintoncongressmen. This came after Flynt's investigator, Dan Moldea, told theWashington Times, "We have a lot of these guys, dead bang, and theevidence is clear. But they haven't been going on TV, or on the floor ofCongress, shooting their mouths off, trying to take the moral high groundagainst Clinton. And as a consequence, we're throwing it back in the river." Ifa Republican "hasn't been shooting his mouth off," Moldea said, "we let himgo."            And, come to think of it, Gingrich was kind of uncharacteristicallyquiet during the impeachment mess, wasn't he? ...            Did Gingrich know Flynt had the goods on him? "We never contacted him," saysMacDonell, though he concedes Gingrich "could have known." MacDonell saysHustler 's concern was getting maximum publicity and sales forHustler , not necessarily making Gingrich behave. "We were going to waituntil the disclosure would do us the most benefit." If Gingrich had come out ina high-profile way and denounced Clinton's sexual immorality, would Flynt havedropped the bomb then? "That was kind of our idea." What if Newt hadn'tresigned after his 1998 election losses, and instead had resolved to seekanother term as House speaker--would Flynt then have tried to bring him down?"Not necessarily," says MacDonell. "We weren't that concerned with bringingdown anybody. We wanted to do the most for [ourselves]."            So was Gingrich effectively (if not illegally) blackmailed? You, the reader,be the judge! I tend to believe MacDonell's claim of pure, publicity-seekingself-interest. But that doesn't mean Gingrich's behavior wasn't affected byknowledge that Flynt, or someone like him, knew about Bisek and might blow thewhistle. Intentionally or not, Flynt served Clinton well.            Flynt would probably agree. Last spring, after Clinton's impeachment trialwas over--and months after Gingrich resigned--he finally published hislong-awaited (and disappointing) Flynt Report. It did allude to theBisek matter, saying: "Rumors of an ongoing affair between the remarried NewtGingrich and a female staff member of then-Congressman Steve Gunderson(R-Wisconsin)* reached HUSTLER from more than one inside source. Maybe thiswhiff of fresh scandal was the deciding factor in Newt's abrupt withdrawal fromthe mud fight." And, Flynt might have added, in determining Newt's fightingstyle during the previous months.            Gingrich's press spokesman, Michael Shields, declined to comment on thisstory when contacted by kausfiles .                           * In 1993, when her romance with the speaker apparently began, Bisek wasan aide to Gunderson.
