Publishing NotesExtra                        The cover of the new Paladin Press catalog (Vol.29, No. 5, September) features this notice: "WARNING: Paladin Press does notintend that any of the information contained in its books or videos be used forcriminal purposes. In specific cases involving such misuse, Paladin willcooperate with law enforcement investigations."            I believe a similar notice appears on the currentKnopf catalog.            Just inside, on Page 3, is this announcement:"EXPLOSIVE BOOKS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. In light of the current political andlegal climate in this country, we have concluded that it is no longer feasibleto publish or sell certain titles on explosives, demolitions, improvisedweaponry, and self-defense, or anything by that quirky but lovable AnneTyler."
