                                 Boy Vey                   BRENTWOOD, Calif.--As we begin the autopsy for Boys R Us--the beer'n' boorishness, boobs 'n' bang-bang, jeans 'n' sneakers, rock 'n' freakingroll pop culture that won the Cold War--it might be wise to determine a time ofdeath. What'll it be: the day Kurt Cobain killed himself? The day KeithOlbermann left ESPN? The day Bill Watterson stopped drawing Calvin andHobbes ?       Or was it yesterday, when an action film starring Bruce Willis gotsquashed in its opening weekend by Lost in Space --featuring a fullyclothed Heather Graham; the youngest girl from Party of Five ; and ahuman body count of zero--and Titanic . Some of us around here stillremember when Titanic was going to be the Ultimate Boy Movie, based onthe Ultimate Boy Tragedy, courtesy of Jim Cameron, the Ultimate Boy Director,the guy who put Jamie Lee Curtis in That Dress, shot down her cleavage, andblew up a bridge beneath her.       Cameron is the Kim Philby of Boys R Us, the man whose Girl Movie in BoyMovie's Clothing led to Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" and to the detritusof Leomania. Titanic spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. box office, beatingthe pants off such movies as Wild Things --whose Boy Culture appeal wassummed up by its star Denise Richards when she told EntertainmentWeekly , "I don't want my dad to see my breasts. I'm hoping he'll cover hiseyes."       Meanwhile, "My Heart Will Go On" has pulled two different albums to thetop of the charts, humiliating new releases from Van Halen and Pearl Jam. Butthe music industry has been hip to the death of Boys R Us since last summer,when Lilith Fair out-grossed Lollapalooza. Last year for the first time,according to the Recording Institute of America, more girls than boys boughtrecords. Three years ago, Trent Reznor was singing, "I wanna fuck you like ananimal"; last year, in "Not Tonight," Li'l Kim and a gaggle of female rapperswere demanding oral satisfaction.       Elsewhere on the cultural landscape, the news for Boy Culture getsbleaker. Television? Two words: Dawson's Creek . Talk radio? Goodbye,Rush ... hello, Dr. Laura. Even sports are under siege. The U.S. women's hockeyteam wins the gold medal? No problem ... but when the men's hockey team losesand gets frisky with a fire extinguisher at the Olympic Village, theypractically have their citizenship revoked. After years of watching locker-roomcelebrations, I thought I was supposed to enjoy it when athletes got rowdy. Notanymore. Check out Boston, where golden-armed QB Drew Bledsoe is in Dutch forstage-diving during an Everclear show last year, and Red Sox slugger Mo Vaughnstill can't get a long-term contract after a couple of strip clubincidents.       Has every American male teen had his allowance suspended or hispart-time job taken away? They're not buying records or movie tickets or novelsor Levi's or Arch Deluxes or Nikes. Even the people who make Budweiser have solittle faith in the buying power of their core audience of males that they'retest-marketing Catalina Blonde, a near-beer expressly designed for women. Andjust when you thought the sport utility vehicle craze could four-wheel BoyCulture back to the mountaintop, here comes the VW Bug, complete with a "Driveit? Hug it? Drive it? Hug it?" ad campaign so insufferable it makes Hello Kittylook like Pulp                Fiction .       So where can Boys R Us make its last stand? There are Comedy Central'sunashamedly foul South Park ; Howard Stern and Jerry Springer; and PamelaAnderson, who could undergo a million makeovers like the one she just receivedand still be the star of The Video. My hopes were pinned on J.J., theCalifornia gray whale nursed back to health by Sea World and then released intothe ocean. J.J. promptly ditched the four (!) transmitters researchers hadimplanted to monitor all perigrenations and breeding patterns. Track this, youaqualosers! Born free, baby! J.J showed up just when boys were in gravestneed--in between Hugh Hefner's calling off his divorce and the release ofGodzilla --to remind us that, whether we see them or not, America's malesare out there, ready to resurface. Trouble is, J.J.'s a she.            -- Chris Connelly
