                                 Guns Don't Kill People; Olympic Athletes Do            Two months ago, Chatterbox wrote an itempraising Bill Bradley for turning the tables on Sam Donaldson and Cokie Robertswhen Donaldson asked Bradley, on ABC's This Week , whether he'd ever usedany illegal drugs. (For a full transcript of the broadcast, click here.) Chatterbox continues to admire Bradley for firingback, "Have you ?" and "Have you , Cokie?" and "George [Will]? Whowants to know?" And Chatterbox continues to find amusing Roberts' desperateattempts to change the subject ("Senator, on guns and violence" and "Can we getto guns and violence?" and "The--you wrote an Op-Ed on guns") after she gaveBradley the ridiculous non-answer that "I was so pregnant during those years."(As Chatterbox observed in the earlier item,Roberts has only two kids.)            But Chatterbox was too beguiled by this little operetta to notice at thetime that once Bradley finally permitted Roberts to change the subject, it wasBradley who gave Roberts a nonsensical answer. Let's pick thedialogue up where Chatterbox's previousitem left off.            At first, Bradley more than held his own:                                             COKIE: The--you wrote an Op-Ed on guns.                              BRADLEY: Yes.               COKIE: Why not ban all handguns? Why just leave it to Saturday-nightspecials?               BRADLEY: Well I would ban Saturday-night specials.               COKIE: I know.               BRADLEY: And ever since I saw Robert Kennedy in a pool of blood on the floorof the Ambassador Hotel, the picture of it, in 1968, I thought any presidentshould ban Saturday-night specials. I think that with regard to all handguns,we should have system of registration and licensing, just like we do forautomobiles. If we can do it for automobiles, we ought to be able to do it tohandguns. We ought to take gun dealers out of residential neighborhoods. Weought to make it a felony, not a misdemeanor, if you sell a gun to somebody whois underage or who is a felon himself. And I think that we ought to put triggerlocks on guns. And I think, finally, that we ought to have background checksfor people who buy guns at the gun shows.                        But then Roberts came up with a very good question:                                             COKIE: But why not just get rid of them?                              BRADLEY: Get rid of all guns? I think that getting rid of all guns ...               COKIE [ Nice try, slick ] : Handguns.                              BRADLEY [ Uh oh ] : Getting rid of all handguns. Well, I mean, whatare we going to [do] with the pentathlon team in the Olympics? [ You may have heardthat I captained the gold-medal-winning U.S. Olympic basketball team in 1964... ] They've got to have handguns. That's an event in the Olympics . There are several other exceptions. So Ibelieve that we can have commonsense ...                              ROBERTS [ I'm ready for ya! ] : England got rid of handguns after theshootings in Scotland, and they participate in the Olympics.                              BRADLEY [ Time to try a little bluster ] : Well the point is, thenthey haven't gotten rid of all the handguns , have they?                              SAM [ Teach you to ask me bullying questions about my pastdrug use, beanpole ] : How many angels can dance on the head of a pin,Senator?                              BRADLEY [ Yo Sam, thanks for overplaying your hand, as usual, withrudeness ] : Well enough to answer this question the way I want to answerit.                                       By then, time had run out on the interview, leaving Roberts no chance to askthe logical follow-up: "Do you favor a handgun ban that would allow anexception for members of the Olympic pentathlon team, like they apparently havein England?" To which Bradley would almost certainly have answered, "No." Whichwould have undercut (though, of course, not eliminated) Bradley's status asBravest Candidate on Gun Control.                           Pedant's corner: Roberts might also have pointed out that the gunsused in the Olympic pentathlon are airpistols, not exactly at the top of Sarah Brady's wish list of firearms toban.
