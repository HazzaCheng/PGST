                                 Monica Speaks to Today's Woman                        Dear Todd:            OK, L.A. is wacky and maybe a little too proud of it. But only theNew York Post would even dream of running an item like the one in "PageSix" today about how Don Hewitt (the executive producer of 60 Minutes )and Christie Brinkley were both seen at the grand opening of a new Kmart in theHamptons, "loading up on bargains." I'm keeping my fingers crossed thattomorrow they'll tell us what some of those bargains were. (The smart money ison giant containers of cheese fish.) But the bottom line is that it is nicejust to realize, in a kind of "We Are the World" sense, as we come upon anotherholiday season, that there are things that even Don Hewitt and ChristieBrinkley can enjoy doing together.            There's a great local story on the front page of the L.A. Times todaythat is sure to hit all the big newscasts and the radio talk shows by thisevening. The female half of a 25-year marriage, "a relationship so close thatthey shared an electric toothbrush" (Yuck. I hope they only mean the handlepart), apparently filed for a quickie divorce from her husband just 11 daysafter she was so busy that she forgot to tell him that she won $1.3 million inthe California Lottery. Cut to a couple of years later when her puzzledhusband, who had no clue as to her motives for leaving the marriage so hastily(but if he had asked me I would have said "Give a little thought to the area ofdental hygiene"), accidentally intercepted a piece of her mail that mentioned afew of the lottery details. The upshot is that he took her to court and now ajudge has ruled that because she "acted out of fraud and malice" when she"violated state asset disclosure laws" during the divorce proceedings, she mustturn the entire lottery win over to her ex. Ouch, that must sting. She isclaiming the only reason she never mentioned the big lotto win to her oncebeloved was due to an "ignorance of the law." You're probably scoffing now, butI, for one, believe her. There are so many painful emotional and logisticaldetails surrounding the nightmare of a divorce--the search for good counseling,the brouhaha about how it will affect the kids--that no one ever really talkspublicly about the ways in which people are often forced to part with a lot oftheir money. Now it's out in the open, I guess.            Elsewhere in the L.A. Times ' "Southern California Living" section,there was a brief review by "fashion experts" of Monica Lewinsky's new handbagenterprise. It gave the Web site address, so I couldn't resist spending a little timethere examining photos of her "purses and totes," each one "adorned with theunique rose-bordered label that says 'Made especially for you by Monica.' "(Wear it with pride!) Come with me now as we revel in the "Garden Patch": "adeep sage green velvet bag with its outer avocado patch pocket," priced at $70and $90. Or luxuriate in the "Bohemian Baroque": "terracotta, gold, salmon, andmaroon chenille tapestry that is reminiscent of an earlier century" (I wonderif she knows which one). Cost to you the consumer? $110 and $130. (But sorryladies, all sold out!) Apparently, we learn in the Web site text, Monica wasbreathing life into these masterpieces as she underwent a "reawakening of mycreative senses" during "an almost undendurable time." Which brings us to herwish for us. "I hope that you recognize the importance of being free spiritedwith your creativity," she writes. Making me think that she may have learnednothing at all from her big ordeal. I'm not sure if the "being free spirited"angle has really worked all that well for her so far.            Actually my favorite part of the Web site is where she writes (under ProductDescription), "Today's woman needs both practicality and durability en vogue."En vogue? Who talks like that? I think what we have here is a rare glimpse ofthe "more mature Monica," the one that she used to exercise when she wouldoffer Bill Clinton her ideas concerning educational reform. (Sadly, I can'trecall whether those more enlightened policy discussions took place before orafter the usual free-spirited stuff.) And since she brought up the issue of"practicality," from a practicality standpoint alone it surprised me that allof her purses are "Dry Clean Only." She of all people should be endorsing aline of fully washable products. If ever there was a person who has learnedfirsthand about the difficulties of having to drag things to the dry cleaners,it would certainly be she. In fact, the least she could do is throw in a bottleof free stain remover for your hundred bucks.            I'm back to reading more string theory now.
