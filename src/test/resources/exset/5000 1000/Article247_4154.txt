                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        By the time most of you read this, the Producer Price Index for Novemberwill have been released, and if this month's other economic statistics are anyindication, the PPI will show only very mild inflationary pressure back up theproducer pipeline.

This may be evidence of the new winner-take-allsociety, or of continued anxiety among workers, or it may be that the wagegains due to productivity are enough to keep workers happy. Or perhaps it'sjust evidence that Alan Greenspan really is God. In any case, on to theChat.            1.
