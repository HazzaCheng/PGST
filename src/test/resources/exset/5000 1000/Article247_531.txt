                                 Roll, Jordan, Roll                           USAToday leads with Kofi Annan's politically-loaded cancellation of a tripto Washington. The Washington Post goes with the weekend call by severalClinton allies for Kenneth Starr to abandon his Whitewater inquiry. TheNew York Timesleads with the first big test for the balanced budget--the pork-linedtransportation bill. And the Los Angeles Times leads with another in its seriesof important stories on the L.A. County Sheriff's Department--this time it'snews of a major bribery scheme involving food contracts for the countyjail.            Kofi Annan was, says USAT , to be in Washington today to meet withPresident Clinton and "bask in praise for ending the threat of war with Iraq."But, U.N. officials told the paper, he postponed his trip after Sen. TrentLott, who last week harshly criticized the deal Annan brokered with Iraq, saidhe didn't have time to meet with him. (Idea for editors: report on Lott'sschedule for this week. It would be interesting to see how many fundraisers andmeetings with lobbyists he manages to fit in.)            The WP lead notes that on weekend yap shows, White House advisor RahmEmmanuel and Sen. Patrick Leahy called on Starr to wind up Whitewater, and thatthree Republican senators also expressed guarded criticism of him. Emmanuelstopped short of saying Starr should resign, but Leahy said, "Sure he should,"adding that he is "totally out of control." The paper reports that over theweekend Arlen Specter, John McCain and Orrin Hatch each questioned Starr'scalling in Sidney Blumenthal to question him in front of a grand jury about hispress contacts. The idea that Starr has blown it is explored in a large pieceinside the Times and was also the subject of an LAT front-pageron Sunday.            The NYT notes that the transportation bill before the Senate is sucha big challenge to the balanced budget because it provides goodies to everycongressional district in the country. The piece points out that among thosewho want to make sure the bill doesn't eat into any budget surplus is NewtGingrich. The Times also notes that the bill raises several partisanside issues that could lead to a confrontation with the White House, namely,proposals to delay new clean air regulations, scale back affirmative actionhiring on highway projects, and lower wage levels for transportation projectworkers.            The Wall Street Journal front page tells the story of how fouryears after the FAA announced its intent to create a $500 million system forallowing commercial aircraft to use military Global Positioning satellites fornavigation, the system is nowhere near in place. In fact, says theJournal , the system might end up costing $14 billion. And the FAA wouldhave to keep paying for the current, conventional system until every airlinehad switched over. Meanwhile, last year, there were 225 near-misses over theU.S., up 22 percent from the year before.            The Journal also reports on the trend of professional sports teamsoffering player education programs in an attempt to keep their newmillionaires out of trouble. The programs typically cover how to handlegamblers, groupies and...salad forks. The most elaborate example, run bybaseball's Texas Rangers, even includes role-playing bimbos, and iseuphemistically called the "Career Development Program."                           USAT 's off-lead reports that, rumors to the contrary, Vernon Jordan,who is scheduled to appear before the Starr grand jury on Tuesday, has notrequested immunity from prosecution. Jordan's lawyer also told the paper thereis no rift between his client and Bill Clinton.            "Military rock and roll is to rock and roll as..." The WP reportsthat Gen. George T. Babbitt, head of the Air Force MaterielCommand at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, recently jammedwith the Ventures, a band he helped form in the late 1950s.
