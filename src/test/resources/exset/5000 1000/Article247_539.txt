                                 The Marines Should Have Landed                           USAToday leads with an unprecedented court decision reinstalling in theMiami mayor's office the former incumbent defeated at the polls last November.The Washington Post leads with the finding by militaryaccident investigators that the crew of a Marine jet was at fault in the deathsof twenty civilians in the Alps last month. The New York Timesleads with word that the American Stock Exchange and the National Associationof Securities Dealers are discussing a stock exchange merger. The Los AngelesTimes goes with California Gov. Pete Wilson's executive abolition ofaffirmative action in the awarding of state contracts. Wilson's announcementcame just days after the courts said such a move would be legal.            The WP reports that accident investigators found that the Marine jet was flying toolow--only 300 to 400 feet when it was supposed to be at 2,000-- and toofast--more than 100 miles per hour over the prescribed limit for theroute--when it struck that Italian cable car wire. (By the way, the Postis wrong to say the plane was going "100 knots per hour" too fast--a "knot" isa (nautical) mile per hour.) As a result, says the paper, they recommend thatthe crew face "some sort of punishment." The NYT , LAT , andUSAT are, in their front-page pieces on the finding, all clearer aboutwhat kind: court-martial and prison. In addition, say the papers, superiors inthe aviators' chain of command are also likely to be subject to furtheradministrative action. Everybody notes that authorities hope the tough stancewill ease Italian demands to try the aviators in the Italian courts.            None of the papers are very clear on why not only the pilot but also theother officers in the plane's crew could plausibly be held accountable. Nonementions that the EA6B only has one set of flight controls and that thereforethe three electronic warfare officers on board cannot control the plane'sspeed, altitude or course. The Post barely brushes this topic,speculating that the investigators may have concluded the tragedy resulted froma decision by the entire crew. But for all the papers say, the finding makes asmuch sense as holding a stewardess responsible for a commercial pilot's flightviolations.            The NYT lead quickly becomes a primer on the history of therelevant stock markets and the differences in mechanics and culture among them.But inexcusably, the piece delays until the ninth paragraph any hint of why thepossible merger could be of interest to the general public: it could meansavings for investors. The merger story is also a leader at the Wall Street Journal , but doesn't make anybody else'sfront.            A USAT inside piece on Linda Tripp reveals that she never labeled thetapes she made of her phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky, but did keepher TV on during the calls, knowing that the World Series broadcasts and sitcomepisodes audible in the background would enable the particular calls to bedated.            The WSJ reports that last year, the purchase of the average-priced new vehicle took almostexactly half a year's worth of median family income. That sounds high, so thereal surprise is that, according to the Journal , this is the lowestlevel since 1980.            The WP reports the results of a joint Associated Press-Center forResponsive Politics survey on lobbying, which show that interest groups arespending $100 million a month to pressure the federal government on pet issues.The number one noodge is the American Medical Association, which, in the firsthalf of 1997, the most recent available reporting period, spent $8.6million.            The NYT has a big illustrated front-page piece on the recentdiscovery that an asteroid, called "1997 XF 11," is likely to pass within30,000 miles of Earth (that's eight times closer than the moon) on October 26,2028. What's more, there's a possibility it will hit Earth then. (The asteroidstory also makes the USAT front and is inside the WP .) Theastronomer making the announcement is quoted saying there is "no immediatecause for alarm." (That's right--the cause for alarm is thirty years from now.)We have, he says, plenty of time "to improve our knowledge of this thing andtake steps, if necessary." Steps, like, says the Times , blowing up anuclear bomb near the asteroid. The Times also mentions that two moviescoming out later this year deal with the scenario of threatened interstellarcollisions. The producers of those movies must just be sooo upset aboutthis news.            TP thinks the big question isn't whether 1997 XF 11 will hit us in2028--it's how will it affect Ken Starr's investigation.
