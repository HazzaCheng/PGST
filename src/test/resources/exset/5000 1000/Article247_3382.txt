                                 The Bell Epoch                        It's hard to imagine, David, but when The Coming of Post-IndustrialSociety was first published in 1973, much of the controversy it generatedarose from the threat it seemed to present to scientific Marxism. How dare Bellsuggest that there might be an interim "post-industrial" stage between thetwilight of monopoly capitalism and the dawn of socialism! You are right thatMarx is not "in vogue" at the moment, although there are somesoi-disant Marxist guerrillas stirring in Colombia. I do not know ofany Bell-ist guerrillas anywhere, except perhaps at the American EnterpriseInstitute.            You are, of course, bang right about stock options muddying the olddichotomy between the capitalist and working classes--although some people havetold me that they can feel quite proletarian when their options are underwater.            Before delving back into this slag-heap of a book for additional nuggets,let me take a breather and say a few more words about Bell the man.                           He marks himself off from his fellow New York intellectuals by describinghimself as "a social democrat in economics, a liberal in politics, and aconservative in culture."               In the mid '60s, he and Irving Kristol founded the policy journal ThePublic Interest , arguing that, with the end of ideology, the ladder to theCity of Heaven must be an "empirical one," based on hardheadedproblem-solving.               Nonetheless, in the '80s, Bell refused to be lumped with Irving Kristol andthe neocons, saying, "Whenever I read about neoconservatism, I think, 'Thatisn't neoconservatism; it's just Irving.' "               Although it is not always apparent in his writing, Bell can be witty,sometimes wickedly so. About his late brother-in-law, the loveable butnotoriously irascible Alfred Kazin, he once remarked, "We're all human, butAlfred abuses the privilege."               An index of Bell's stature abroad: An international jury has just honoredhim with the Prix Tocqueville, which carries a cash award of 100,000 Frenchfrancs. Previous recipients include Raymond Aron, Karl Popper, and OctavioPaz.               Yiddish was Bell's first language as he grew up on New York's Lower EastSide. An uncle changed the family name from "Bolotsky" to "Bell."                        Now back to the book. The more I think about Bell's farsightedness, the lessimpressed I am by it. Most of the trends he wrote about were well establishedby the early '70s. The United States had already become the first nation in theworld in which services had come to dominate manufacturing (both in employmentand as a share of GNP). Computerization had been under way for two decades.Information technology had been playing an increasing role in industrialproduction since after the Second World War, when the field of "operationsresearch" (inventory control, etc.) was invented to help the U.S. miliarymanage its massive war effort. When Bell peers into the future, toward the year2000, his forecasts are often the opposite of what has proved to be the case.For instance, he predicted that more and more public outcomes would bedetermined by government technocrats rather than the market (the way thingsare, say, in France). That has not happened--as witness, for instance, healthcare, which, after the political fiasco of Hillary Clinton's abortive reform,is increasingly being governed by insurance companies and HMOs.            So what is Bell's achievement in this book? He was the first to identify thestructural changes in American society that led to the "information age." Hedreamed up a conceptual scheme, full of ideal types and whatnot, that tiedeverything together. I don't think that conceptual scheme has a whole lot ofexplanatory or predictive value--the way Marx's would if only it were true--butat least it has helped us to see the post-industrial society steadily andwhole, and as something qualitatively different from the industrial societythat it superseded. By naming the thing, Bell ushered it into existence. Thanksto him, we see it as obvious, a clich.            One thing still bothers me, though. Bell often writes about information asthough it is something we consume directly, something that makes us happy. Infact, our "utility functions," as economists call them, have not reallychanged. The final goods from which we derive satisfaction are food andmanufactured objects--the products of agricultural and industrial society.Information has transformed the mode of production, rationalized it, madeproduction and markets more efficient, and so on. But the informationrevolution has not changed the nature of the good life. Or has it, David?
