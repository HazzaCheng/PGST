                                 Kids as Status Symbols            So, you've got the beachhouse compound on Nantucket, the 63-foot Hinckley sailboat, the corporate jet,the nanny, and the gardener; and your stay-at-home spouse with the advancedacademic degree heads up the local United Way campaign. What other acquisitionmight serve your high economic and social status? How about having some morekids?            It haslong been a demographic truism that richer means fewer, not more, kids. And asfar as it goes, census data seem to bear this out. As the average incomes ofAmericans have increased, the smaller their families have become. Since theheight of the baby boom in the 1950s, the number of children born to anAmerican woman has dropped from an average of 3.76 to only 1.98 today. And thisphenomenon is not confined to the United States. The average number of childrenborn to women in Western Europe has fallen from 2.5 in 1960 to 1.6 today.            People have lots of reasons for choosing to have fewerchildren, including the expansion of opportunities for women in the workplace,but it is an undeniable fact that rearing children in the modern world is anexpensive activity. Throughout most of history children were net assets--theytoiled in the fields, mucked out the barn, and cared for their parents in oldage. But modern parents don't really expect much of a return from the resourcesthey spend on their children. Sure, Johnny may mow the lawn and Jenny might runthe dishwasher, but in general kids today do little to contribute directly to afamily's bottom line.            The U.S. Census Bureauconfirms that women in households with the lowest average annual incomes--thoseunder $10,000--have had the most children; 2.3 on average. By contrast,upper-middle-class households--those making more than $75,000--have an averageof only 1.8 kids. One interpretation of these numbers is that poor parentsstill think that children are a reasonable investment. In a poor rural family,children still do chores on the farm. And before welfare reform, at least, anadditional child usually meant an increase in a poor urban family'sbenefits.            Meanwhile,for the upper-middle class, providing for progeny is expensive. Parents try topay for private-school educations, soccer club and pool memberships, andFrench, piano, and dance lessons. Of course, these parents are spending thismoney in an attempt to assure the future success of their children. But evenwith an income of $75,000 per year, they can afford only so much for Skip andBuffy's tutoring, so they limit their family size in order to bestow more onfewer kids.            But recently I have noticed that many of mywealthier acquaintances, people who live in tonier suburbs like Potomac, Md.,or Darien, Conn., are bucking the trend toward smaller families. Many havethree or four kids. Some intriguing, if sketchy, data suggest that at thehighest levels of wealth and income, the trend is toward larger, not smaller,families.            Forexample, Mendelsohn Research--a company that supplies consumer research toadvertisers, advertising agencies, and publishing companies--offers somesuggestive data. Mendelsohn's most recent annual survey shows that thosehouseholds with children where the annual family income exceeds $250,000 areblessed with an average of 2.3 children currently at home. That is 0.5 kidsmore than the upper-middle-class average and the same number as the lowestcensus income category. And because the Mendelsohn data don't include kids whohave left home--while the census data do--the number of children born in thesevery wealthy families could be even higher.            One other interesting figure comes from the very tiptop ofthe wealth scale. The households that compose the Forbes 400 richest Americansaverage 2.88 children. That's 1.08 kids more than the upper-middle class canafford.            These added kids provide manyopportunities for status signaling. Wealthy parents can talk endlessly at thecountry club about the costs of Maine summer camps, high-school semestersabroad, little Andrew's sailing trophies, and what hunt Sarah rides withregularly. And of course, there are schools and universities. Did they prep atSt. Albans or Choate? How well are they doing at Harvard, Yale, or Middlebury?Being able to provide lavishly for a large number of children shows that you'vereally got it made.            This is not to say that richpeople don't love their kids. Rather, kids today are not only little bundles ofjoy but also are perhaps the ultimate symbols of worldly success and status.Perhaps we are now seeing a new social phenomenon--trophy kids.
