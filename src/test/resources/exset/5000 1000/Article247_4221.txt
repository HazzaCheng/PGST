                                 Cinematic Morals                        Dear David,.            As to whether Pauline Kael, you and I, or anyone, should support a filmsimply because it might do humanity some good, my argument is: All good filmsdo humanity some good, and no bad films do. So I will not give a movie a passbecause its heart is in the right place, and voted thumbs down on such as ASoldier's Story , Besieged , Buena Vista Social Club (greatmusic, bad direction, terrible story sense, too much Ry Cooder), Jakob theLiar , and The Other Sister .            In writing approvingly about The Green Mile , I was not endorsing itfor political reasons but for personal ones. Aware although I was of thebroadness of the John Coffey character, I genuinely liked the movie--found itabsorbing, careful storytelling. Reports from theaters indicate audiences, byand large, love it and are moved by it; it may emerge as the season's biggesthit.            If I have "saddled myself with political responsibilities," it has not beenconsciously, but I don't think that would be a bad thing for any critic to do,at least when a film makes it appropriate. My intense dislike for Very BadThings and the second half of Fight Club reflected political ormoral outrage, among other things. And should have. Anyone who can find racismin The Green Mile but not fascism in Fight Club is lookingthrough a very specialized filter.            But I hope you don't believe I would praise or attack a movie I didn'tactually like/hate, just because of a political agenda. As for the "damnJar-Jar picture," that one is an excellent example of a film so quicklydismissed by fast-draw gossip that many critics (I am not including you) mayhave been ashamed to say they liked it. It could have been the lost footagefrom Magnificent Ambersons and if presented by George Lucas in thatclimate would have been shot down. It is always a little sad when critics tunetheir strings with "Page Six." When Janet Maslin announced she was leaving thetimes, the New York Observer headline said (quoting from memory) "LikedPhantom Menace , Hated Gummo ." As if, 'nuff said. My thoughtwas, So?                        As for Jar-Jar, what was the matter with him? Didn't like his accent?Thought his movements were too alien, or not alien enough? Aliens in movies areroutinely made understandable, likable, comprehensible. Or monsters. Can theynot also be goofy and very odd?            Are the "common man and woman" capable of responding to works of complexity?Sometimes. Depends on the work. But you cite Being John Malkovich ,Three Kings , and South Park as your examples, and I can onlyobserve that the first did disappointingly at the box office, the second onlyfairly well, and while South Park made piles of money, my own guess,having attended a public screening, is that its fans did not respond to it withcomplexity but embraced its vulgarity while the irony whizzed rightoverhead.            Some of the reviews of that film were hilarious in the way they praised itfor accomplishments that had no remote connection, I suspect, to the way it wasseen, perceived, enjoyed, and understood by most audiences. They liked thedirty jokes, the homophobia, and racism and the shit jokes, period. Thefunction of that material as liberating irony and reverse criticism, etc., waslimited to an elite minority within the audience. I believe I was too hard onthe movie in my original review, and doubled back a little in a later TVprogram on animation, but the notion that most audience members picked up inits complexities strikes me as optimistic.                           South Park 's cheerfully blatant racism was praised as satiricalanti-racism by some of the same critics who found racism in The GreenMile , a film its makers intended to be anti-racist. My best guess is: Alarge majority of the audience for South Park processed the racism onits primary level and missed the irony, and a large majority of the audiencefor The Green Mile will see no racism, and if their attitudes areinfluenced by the movie, it will make them less racist, not more. The criticaldiscussion of the racial content of those two movies has been too clever byhalf.            Best,R
