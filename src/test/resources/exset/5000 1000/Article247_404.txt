                                 Arafat Chance            The Albright mission to the Middle East continues to get big play, leadingat the Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes , and topping the Wall Street Journal worldwide news-digest box. The releaseof official Army studies revealing widespread sexual harassment in the serviceleads at the New York Times .And USAToday leads with the Senate's passage of a national educational testingplan.            What's most interesting about today's coverage of the Albright story is theamount of story-shaping on display. The same picture of Albright shaking handswith Arafat accompanies the WP and NYT stories. It shows Arafatbeaming and Albright anything but. Which raises the question, was this reallythe best picture they had or were the editors trying to "say" something withit? And although these papers and the LAT all communicate the same basicfacts about yesterday's events--that Arafat responded to Albright's demands bypromising full cooperation in the fight against anti-Israeli terrorism and thatNetanyahu was very cool toward her entreaties to him to cease landconfiscations, home demolitions, settlement building, confiscation of IDs andthe embargoing of tax revenues belonging to the Palestinian authority--theirheadlines differ in what they emphasize. The LAT runs its story under"Arafat Promises Albright a Steady Anti-Terror Effort," while the WPuses "Albright Urges Israeli Restraint" and the NYT runs it under"Albright Asks Israel To Take a 'Timeout' on Settlements."            The NYT 's lead reports that the Army's largest-ever investigation ofsexual misconduct in the ranks found that it was very widespread and that theservice leadership was to blame. Also, investigators concluded that most femaletroops were unwilling to report instances of sexual misconduct out of awell-founded fear that they, and not their harassers, would be punished. Boththe Times and WP stories quote statistics from the studies abouthow soldiers perceive the atmosphere they serve in, such as "47 percent of thefemale troops polled reported that they had experienced 'unwanted sexualattention,' " or "22 percent of the women and 7 percent of the men said theyhad been sexually harassed in the last year." These are good examples of achronic newspaper gaffe: the uncontextual stat. The reader doesn't know whatsuch claims say about the Army because he or she doesn't know the correspondingnumbers for the same claims in other lines of work. And the papers fail here(as they often do) to provide them.            The Post treats this as purely a story about workplace gender bias.For the most part, the NYT does the same until late in its piece when itobserves that the problems unearthed are "evidence of a larger breakdown oftrust between soldiers." It's USAT that recognizes this as the mostdamaging detail, emphasizing it above all else in its headline--"Soldiers LackConfidence in Their Officers"--and lead: "Soldiers have deep misgivings abouttheir commanders and don't feel confident about following them into combat, aharsh Army report said Thursday."            Perhap's today's biggest story is nobody's lead--another in the WP 'sseries of investigative pieces on campaign fund raising. This morning's effortby Brian Duffy and Bob Woodward reports that Janet Reno and the directors ofthe FBI, the CIA, and the National Security Agency yesterday told members ofthe Thompson committee that they had credible intelligence indicating that TedSioeng, a prominent Los Angeles-based businessman, acted on behalf of China toinfluence 1996 election races via illegal campaign contributions.            The fronts of USAT , the WP , and the NYT bring news of agovernment report saying that AIDS deaths dropped 26 percent last year and thatthe disease is no longer the No. 1 cause of death among Americans ages 25-44,as it had been for the previous two years.            The WSJ "Washington Wire" reports that the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration "advises its staff not to comment on inquiries aboutwhether Princess Diana could have survived her car crash if she had worn a seatbelt."
