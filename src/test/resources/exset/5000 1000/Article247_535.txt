                                 White House of Blues                           USAToday , the Washington Post , and the New York Timesall lead with the latest developments in the White House sex scandal. TheLosAngeles Times goes another way, leading with the latest developments inthe White House money scandal (remember?).            The Lewinsky matter moved Thursday on several fronts, which get covered tovarying degrees. The USAT lead reports that while denying anyobstruction of justice, Jordan said that he kept Bill Clinton informed abouthis efforts to land Monica Lewinsky a private-sector job. USAT also hasthe Post traumatic distress syndrome of Robert Bennett, one of Clinton'sprivate lawyers, as well as word that Ginsburg and Starr squared off before afederal judge, but in both regards it leaves important details out. You have toread the Post to learn that Bennett not only viewed the WPdeposition leak as "reckless, reprehensible and unethical" but also that hesaid, "We are going to seek relief in court on this...." (Apparently, Bennettdidn't elaborate and the Post wasn't about to--after all, it's theWP 's source Bennett is talking about going after.) And to learn that thepoint of the closed hearing was so Ginsburg could try to convince a judge tomake Starr abide by a preliminary agreement to extend immunity to Lewinsky inreturn for her testimony.            Both the WP and NYT describe the wild scene outside thecourthouse, mobbed with press and topped off with anti-Clinton protestorschanting, "Five-six-seven-eight! Married men don't date!"            The two papers also detail Clinton's hot reaction to Thursday's Postscoop: "the court has made it absolutely clear it is illegal to leak anddiscuss" his deposition. Both papers report that all players in thecontroversy--including Ken Starr and Paula Jones' lawyers--deny leaking thedepo. Also, the LAT front reports that Clinton "sternly refused" toexplain Thursday why in his deposition, he said he warned Monica L. that shewas likely to be called in the Jones case.            The NYT lead plays catch-up on the depo story by pointing out thatthe deposition's heavier than anticipated focus on Lewinsky makes sense of theprior Times scoop about Betty Currie's testimony that, the day after,Clinton went over with her the facts about his relationship with the intern.The piece emphasizes how in the Clinton deposition account Currie is thecentral figure, even to the point where it was her idea to get Monica a giftwhen he went to Martha's Vineyard on vacation. The Times adds thistidbit: Clinton said in his depo that previous accusations about drug dealingand even murder had left him "paranoid."            The LAT lead is the news that California campaign donor Johnny Chung,who once compared the White House to a subway, where you need coins to open thedoors, will plead guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud and election law violationsin an agreement with the DOJ under which he will cooperation with theDepartment's fund-raising investigation. The paper also reports that anotherbig Clinton donor suspected of funneling foreign money to the Democratic Party,Yogesh Gandhi, was arrested Thursday on unrelated fraud charges as he preparedto leave the country. The WP and NYT run the Chung story on theirfront pages.            The Wall Street Journal reports that military planners ofpossible airstrikes against Iraq have become less confident of the U.S. abilityto bomb biological weapons sites in Iraq after a secret Air Force test in whicha special bomb that was expected to incinerate a stockpile of anthrax-likegerms instead spread them.            While all the dailies were going front-page earlier this week with the newsthat hands-on basketballer Latrell Sprewell was being given his millions back,there was virtually no newsplay of his most recent escapade. It seems that onMonday, Sprewell was involved in a car accident that sent two other people tothe hospital. The California Highway Patrol says Sprewell's Mercedes wastraveling at "high speed" when it struck sand barrel obstacles, hit a wall andthen collided with another car. Witnesses said they'd seen Sprewell speeding.Perhaps the Highway Patrol fears another arbitrator in the wings. It didn'tgive Sprewell a ticket. All this information comes from the only press coverage"Today's Papers" is aware of--a brief AP item on page 4 of Tuesday's LATsports section. You know, where everyone put the news that OJ had pleaded nocontest to beating his wife.
