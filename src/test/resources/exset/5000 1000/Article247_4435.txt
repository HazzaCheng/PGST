                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        Lots of impressive earnings reports this week from the usual suspects(America Online, Sun Microsystems, Gateway, and Microsoft, among others), andtech stocks remained fairly strong. But the Dow took it on the chin, perhapsbecause (if you're feeling cynical) people who invest in Dow stocks are theonly people who still worry about things like rising interest rates or perhapsbecause (if you're feeling Chicago-school rational) the Dow has more stocks init that will be hit hard by a cyclical slowdown than does the Nasdaq. The truthis it's hard to say.            In any case, the merger wave continued, with Glaxo and SmithKline Beechamannouncing engagement plans. The news sent both companies' stocks down sharply,but their CEOs never stopped smiling. The thing is, after the 1980s, we weresupposed to have understood that most mergers don't work, and that when thestock market punishes both stocks, the merger really won't work. Butthen I remember: Even now, the stock market doesn't run companies. Men who likethe idea of running as big a company as can be imagined do. And so, on to thisweek's Cocktail Chat.            1. "The Wall Street Journal reported that Warner-Lambert, AmericanHome Products, and Procter & Gamble are trying to concoct a three-waydeal to 'foil' Pfizer's $78.9 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.The Journal used the word 'foil,' but surprisingly, it did not run aphoto of Pfizer's CEO twirling his black mustache."            2. "The interest rate on the 30-year U.S. bond is now actually lowerthan the interest rate on the seven-year U.S. bond. In other words, investorsthink it's safer to lend money for a long time than for a short time(relatively speaking, since seven years ago the first George Bush was stillpresident). Apparently bond traders are now anticipating a steep decline in thealready low inflation rate, beginning in the winter of 2007."            2a. "Do you think Soylent Green will really be people in 2007? I hopenot."            3. "In Microsoft's 70-page response to Judge Thomas PenfieldJackson's finding of fact in its antitrust case, the company compared itsdesire to control the presentation of Windows on PC screens to                   MontyPython's Flying Circus               ' desire to avoid having its shows editedwithout the troupe's input. This means, of course, that if the case ever getsto the penalty phase, Judge Jackson will have to demand, before everythingelse, that Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer bring him a shrubbery, lest he have tosay 'Ni!' "            4. "Best headline of the week: 'Mannesmann, Under Attack, Looks toFrance .' Presumably praying that the grandson of Petain is running someFrench telecom giant."            5. "New York Sen. Charles Schumer is taking a lot of heat forsupporting President Clinton's plan to extend Medicare to prescription-drugcoverage after taking campaign contributions from a couple of big drugcompanies . But since the drug companies have firmly opposed the expansionof Medicare before semi-caving recently, all Schumer did was take their moneyand then sell them out. With today's campaign-finance system, that's probablyas close to clean government as we're going to get."            6. "Michael Berger, founder of the Manhattan Investment hedge fund, admittedlast Friday that he had been lying about his annual performance toinvestors in his fund for the past four years. Berger was a well-known bear,and over that same period often published letters warning that the stock marketwas on the verge of a crash, but despite the fact that the crash never came,investors kept giving him their money . Well, I guess there wereMillerites even after the world didn't end in 1841."            7. "Oil prices jumped this week, due to cold weather in theNortheast . That's certainly sensible. After all, who really knows if thiswinter thing is really a pattern or just a statistical fluke?"
