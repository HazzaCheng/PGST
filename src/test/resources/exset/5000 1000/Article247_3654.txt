                                 Raisa and Raises                           USA Today and the Washington Postlead with the sodden aftermath of Floyd, which President Clinton spentyesterday inspecting. The New YorkTimes fronts that, but leads instead with the tremendous earthquake(magnitude 7.6) that hit Taiwan early today, killing thousands, and trappingperhaps just as many in toppled-over and collapsed buildings. Everybody elsefronts the quake. The Los AngelesTimes , however, leads with the day's dollop of the city's metastasizingpolice brutality and corruption scandal: that a police captain chose to ignoreofficers' allegations of a stationhouse beating of a suspect.                           USAT emphasizes Floyd'snationwide toll, favoring numbers to do so: One million people in New Jerseyordered by authorities to boil their tap water; total damages possibly as highas Andrew's $26.5 billion, the U.S. record; 62 deaths in 12 states and one inthe Bahamas. The WP goes more for narrative, withsuch passages as: "In county after county, meanwhile, people confrontedhardships that seemed almost biblical in scope: Coffins sent floating away fromlow-lying cemeteries; portable incinerators being assembled to dispose of100,000 dead hogs and a million drowned poultry; oceanfront homes being sweptaway; and thousands of residents living without safe tap water, telephones ormail service."            The insertion of the U.N.-supported peacekeeping forceinto East Timor is going so uneventfully thus far that it's off everybody'sfront save the NYT's.            Everybody but the NYT(which runs it inside) fronts the death from leukemia of Raisa Gorbachev. TheWP and NYT especiallycapture the sense in which she broke Soviet ground as a political wife: lessdowdy, more fashion-conscious, if not downright materialistic (with her ownAmerican Express card, the Times reminds). But thecoverage fails to deliver a bit in its attempts to depict any furthercontribution. USAT says she "drew criticism forspeaking out" and the Times says she emerged assomeone "who had her own mind," but neither describes any position she evertook on anything.            The WP runs a long storyinside claiming to move the ball forward on the question of how George W. Bushcame to get a slot in the Texas Air National Guard. The then-speaker of theTexas legislature had been saying that although he often received requests forGuard placement, he never received such a request from anyone in the Bushfamily, including GWB's father. But now, says the Post , the ex-speaker says he did intervene, at the request of agood friend of the elder Bush.            The Wall StreetJournal reports that according to the latest government stats, laborproductivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector rose 4.1 percent in 1998, thesame as the year before. Robert Kuttner, in his WPop-ed advocating further raises in the minimum wage, observes that the past twoyears have shown that raising the minimum wage doesn't detract from jobcreation. The just-quoted statistic suggests that they've shown it also doesn'tdetract from--maybe stimulates--productivity.            The WP fronts the third inits well-reported series looking insidethe high echelons of the U.S. and NATO military during the Kosovo war. Todaythe emphasis is on the war-long dispute between NATO commander Army Gen. WesleyClark and his subordinate, air warfare chief Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Short.Clark wanted to use his air assets to target tactical assets, such as tanks andartillery pieces in the field, while Short wanted to hit strategic targets,such as ministry buildings and power plants. In noting that, according to therecently released bomb damage figures from the war, two-thirds of all Yugoslavarmy assets in Kosovo survived intact, the Postleaves the reader with the impression that it was the strategiccampaign--Short's target list--that made the difference.            Back to the LAT and thepolice scandal for a beat. The paper reports that city officials are bracingfor a raft of legal claims likely to be brought against the city by suspectswho've been arrested or questioned by the policemen implicated thus far.Question about that: Just as papers routinely appeal to citizens to provideinformation they might have about unsolved crimes or fugitives, why doesn't theLAT invite readers who think they've beenmistreated by the officers in question to come forward? Of course, this wouldbe easier if the public knew what the officers look like--which raises anotherquestion: Why hasn't the LAT run theirpictures?
