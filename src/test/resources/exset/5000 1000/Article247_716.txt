                                 Netanyahu's Right-Hand Man?            The NewYork Times leads with the Senate's narrow rejection of a patients'rights bill. The Washington Post leads with Congress's self-approvedextension of the budget deadline. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the problems associated with the last few days' suddenleap in mortgage rates.            The NYT lead, also fronted by the WP , says that the Senatevoted 50-47 to quash a health care bill backed by the Democrats. The bill wouldhave guaranteed access to emergency care and medical specialists and made iteasier to sue HMOs for improper denial of care. In the lead paragraph, theNYT states the causes of the bill's demise: "heavy lobbying by theinsurance industry and of the sex scandal that has enveloped PresidentClinton." (Explanation: distraction. Clinton has been too bogged down inscandal to lobby hard for the bill.)            But the national budget may meet a happier fate. With the unanimous 421-0passage of a temporary spending bill, the government now has until midnightMonday to come up with a budget package. (Today's Papers, incidentally,approves the concept of voting oneself deadline extensions.) But even the newdeadline may not be enough time for Congress to resolve all remaining issues.Among the sticklers: President Clinton's education initiatives; IMF funding;the use of statistical sampling in the upcoming census; and even whether givingcontraceptives to minors requires parental notification. Only six of 13spending bills were completed yesterday, and all unfinished measures willprobably be glopped together into one mammoth spending bill.            The LAT lead attributes the mortgage rate rise--in some casesamounting to half a percentage point--to the stuttering global economy. Calledthe most dramatic mortage rate development since the October 1987 stock marketcrash, the rise is forcing consumers across the country to pay more than theyanticipated, or to make last-minute changes of plan. However, says theLAT , rates are not expected to rise much further.            The NYT and the WP both run stories on the Judiciary Committeewitness selection. The WP emphasizes that Kenneth Starr may be among thefirst called to testify (Chairman Henry Hyde having relaxed his objections),but probably President Clinton will not be called. The NYT story playsup the committee's partisan disagreements over the witness issue. Republicanswant the heavy-hitters in the scandal, while Democrats badly want Starr.            The LAT reports that Pakistan is barreling toward "full Islamic law."The country's lower house of Parliament Friday voted to make the Koran thesupreme law of Pakistan. Human rights leaders fear that this could escalateinto further, Taliban-esque repression. The bill must still be passed by theupper house of Parliament.            The NYT runs a bottom front story on last month's court victory by apsychotic killer, Wendell Williamson, against his therapist. The North Carolinaverdict, which netted Williamson $500,000, states that the therapist did notsufficiently follow up with Williamson after terminating their sessions, anddid not sufficiently explain Williamson's condition to him. These sins ofomission, according to the verdict, factored into Williamson's shooting of twopeople shortly after the sessions ended. Psychiatrists around the country areunderstandably worried; the psychiatrist in question intends to appeal.            All papers run stories on the appointment of Israel's new foreign minister.The tapping of Ariel Sharon, who strongly supports Jewish settlements in theWest Bank, is widely seen as a move by Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu to appease his party's far right. Though the Palestinians are upset,the appointment may conversely smooth peace negotiations: Netanyahu will havealready secured the far right, the logic goes, so he can afford to yield morein the peace negotiations next week. Sharon has already shown himself to berather handy with diplomacy: He has vowed never to shake Palestinian Authorityleader Yasser Arafat's hand, and he also remarked on a previous occasion thatBenjamin Netanyahu doesn't know his right hand from his left.
