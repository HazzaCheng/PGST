                                 Oldies but Goodies                        Dear Chris,            Yes, I loved the anecdote about Bob Dylan's mishearing "I can't hide" as "Iget high." And you're right about how easy it is to get caught up in the soundand supply your own meanings. Rock can be almost pure Keatsian negativecapability. For weeks in 1985 I thought the big Tears for Fears song was"Everybody Wants To Live Alone." And for a good two decades--until about sixmonths ago, in fact--I listened to one of my favorite Tom Waits songs, "I WishI Was in New Orleans (In the Ninth Ward)," thinking the Ninth Ward was a wingof Bellevue rather than a neighborhood in New Orleans. All this time Iknew what the Ninth Ward was--and the song is about New Orleans.But my Will to Narrative, as Nietzsche might have called it, was stronger thanmy ear.            My favorite such story, often told in the drug-dimmed dorm rooms of myyouth, was that Ralf Hutter (of Kraftwerk) wrote "(Wir fahren, fahren, fahrenauf der) Autobahn" after mishearing the Beach Boys' "Fun, Fun, Fun" as "She'llhave fahren, fahren, fahren till her daddy takes her T-Bird away." Ihave always assumed it to be totally apocryphal. On the other hand, it makesperfect sense.            The Dylan anecdote reminds me that the book is chock-a-block with excellenttidbits--some familiar, most not--and it would be unfair to let the week passwithout sharing a few favorites:                           Carl Perkins wrote "Blue Suede Shoes" never having seen the word "suede" inprint. ("Blue Swaed Shoes," he called it.)               Listen to the mere stage names of the overproduced Liverpudlian rock studswho preceded the Beatles: Tommy Steele, Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, RoryStorm.               Dick Clark had no particular interest in the rock he was promoting, or inmusic whatsoever. When, shortly before appearing on Edward R. Murrow'sPerson to Person , he was told that Murrow would want to ask about arecord collection, he had to borrow one. He didn't have a recordcollection.                        I'm still trying to figure out what Miller means when he talks about rock asa force for nostalgia. I'm convinced that this is largely a personal project.There's much in the elegiac tone of this book that reminds me of PhilipLarkin's collection All What Jazz? Larkin, to whom "jazz" meanteverything you could hear in war-depleted Oxford--basically, Kid Ory and BixBeiderbecke and King Oliver--was turned loose as contemporary jazzcritic for the Daily Telegraph a quarter-century later, having notlistened to any jazz in the interim. He heard a lot of Mingus and Coltrane andMonk and threw up his hands as if to say, "What's this crap?"            While Miller can't write like Larkin, his nostalgia project is a moreresponsible one. He gives us a history of the term "oldies but goodies," andmentions "In the Still of the Night," scarcely noticed when it came out in1956, but by 1959 a staple of the oldies circuit. In my own life, I remember AlGreen as a serious but secondary musician in the mid-1970s; if the air-time onoldies stations is any indication of his ultimate stature, he's one of thegiants. Similarly, I remember that on the Pretenders' debut album, "Talk of theTown" and "Stop Your Sobbing" got the most play--but only on alternativestations. The album didn't have any "hits." Today, no matter what town you'relistening to the "Classic Rock" station in, it's "Brass in Pocket"--maybe theedgiest, least mainstream thing on the whole album--that gets all theairplay.            Ahem ... after writing that sentence, I looked in a rock reference book andfound that "Brass in Pocket" hit No. 14 stateside. But I think I'll leave it,as evidence that it's my memory that's failing. Perhaps rock history islike retrospective politics. If you poll people on how they voted in 1960, 80percent say they backed Kennedy, even though Nixon got 50 percent of the vote.And if you ask people what they were listening to in the mid-to-late '60s,they'll tell you, "Oh, you know ... a lot of Velvet Underground, a lot ofHendrix."            But I don't believe it.            Best,Chris.
