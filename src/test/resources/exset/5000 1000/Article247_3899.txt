                                 Gore and Bradley Debate            HANOVER, N.H.--Al Gore performed this evening on astage at Dartmouth College. He told jokes, blasted his rival's proposedhealth-care reform proposal as too costly, expressed "disappointment and anger"at President Clinton, and kissed up shamelessly to members of the audience.Bill Bradley was also present at the event.             Gore arrived on stage like some sort of feral animalwho had been locked in a small cage and fed on nothing but focus groups forseveral days. Upon release, he began to scamper furiously in every direction atonce. Assuming his stool 20 minutes before showtime, he volunteered to takeextra questions from the audience. At the end of the hour-long non-debate, hepromised to stay and answer even more. As of this writing (10:30 p.m.) he'sstill at it, sitting on the edge of the stage with his wife, talking abouthuman rights in Africa and offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico with afew dozen New Hampshirites.             Gore came across as a kind of manic politicalvaudevillian. He oozed empathy from every pore, getting all over everyquestioner like a cheap suit. First he would ask the person about hiscircumstances, his family, or his job, in a desperate effort to bond. Then hewould respond with an explosion of gesticulation, sympathy, and agreement. Atthe very first question, which referred to "behavior by members of youradministration," Gore came out with a blast of empathy for emotions thequestioner never expressed. "I understand the disappointment and anger you feeltoward President Clinton," he proclaimed. "I felt it myself." In fact, thequestioner didn't even mention Clinton directly. Not content with the sixdebates Bradley has already agreed to, Gore challenged his opponent to debateevery week .            At first, you think: Hey, this new Al Gore's not such astiff after all. Then you think: This new Gore is a bit over the top. By theend of an hour, the impression is of someone as desperate as he is unable toachieve Clintonian union with his audience. "Tell me about your family," heasked a questioner who asked him what he was going to do about school violence."I have one daughter 17 months old and a husband," she answered. "Which one doyou have the most trouble with?" Gore joked, smarmily.            A clinical psychologist who asked about the problem ofHMOs limiting coverage for mental-health patients also got a full Gore-bombing."I guarantee you I'm committed to it," Gore said."Give me a chance to roll up my sleeves and go to work on this. This is one Iwant to fix for you ." He then told a strainedjoke about managed care: An HMO employee who arrives at the pearly gates and istold by St. Peter, "You can come in, but you can only stay three days." Thiselicited groans in the room where several hundred reporters watched the debateon video monitors, as did Gore's fulsome expression of thanks to the people ofNew Hampshire for the wonderful lessons they had taught him.            Gore's problem, I think, is that he has watched BillClinton for seven years, so he knows just how seamlessly a politician can bondwith an audience. But even as he copies the steps, he lacks the music. When hetries to emulate Clinton's audience-meld technique, he overdoes it, grossly.The problem isn't that Gore can't be personal and expressive. It's that as aperformer, he has no emotional range. When he pumps up to the volume, he alwaysturns it up to 10. This makes him seem insincere, inauthentic, and justgenerally fake, in a way Clinton seldom does. Television somehow heightensGore's plasticity. I saw him in person after the debate, when he sat on thestage answering questions. He was calmer and seemed much less phony.            Bill Bradley, by contrast, makes almost no personalimpression. Dowdily dressed and gravel-voiced, he is as close to affectlessnessas anyone who I can remember running for high office. Aside from one direct andpassionate defense of gay rights, which got the biggest applause of the night,I've already forgotten most of what he said. Challenged repeatedly by Gore onthe high cost of his health proposal, he finally responded by uttering, in hisunmodulated, low mumble: "I want to make one clarification. We all have our ownexperts. I dispute the cost figure that Al has used." Other than that, hedidn't rise to Gore's bait.            But running against the world's most eager salesman,refusing to market oneself may be a plausible stance. Bill Bradley doesn't haveto win you over with his charisma. He just has to wait for you to get sick todeath of Al Gore.
