                                 Principals Make Out            The Washington Post , Los AngelesTimes and USA Today all lead with the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling thatschool districts may not be held responsible for sexual relations betweenteachers and students unless school officials know about and fail to stop theactivity. The New York Timesmakes the school ruling its off-lead but goes its own way by leading with theClinton administration's order of sweeping new protections for Medicarerecipients that will require private health plans treating them to guaranteeaccess to specialists, the provision of translators when needed and medicalrecord confidentiality. The order also grants Medicare beneficiaries the rightto obtain information about the financial condition of a private heath plan andabout how its doctors are paid.                           USAT notes that the Court's school decision will make it much harderfor student victims of sexual abuse and harassment to win damages. TheLAT adds that this will be true even at schools that fail to establishsexual harassment policies and fail to give students a way to complain aboutabuses. The NYT reports that in his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevenssaid the decision gives school districts an incentive not to take steps toprotect students. The Times lead editorial says the decision "perverselydeprived" students and their families of an effective legal remedy. TheWP best communicates the scope of the ruling by eschewing in its lead sentencethe generality of "sexual abuse" ( LAT ) and "sexual relations"( USAT ) in favor of the concreteness of referring to students who are"sexually taunted, groped or harassed." Everybody points out that the Courtwill be ruling soon on the similar question of employer responsibilitiesregarding supervisors' sexual harassment of workers in a job setting. But thereis another bit of context missing from all accounts: what responsibilities thelaw currently assigns to school districts with regard to other sorts of teachermisconduct.            In a story that's sure to develop in the days ahead, the WP off-leadreports that U.N. investigators have evidence that before the Gulf War,Iraq put nerve gas into missile warheads.            The USAT and NYT fronts report that the painkiller Duract isoff the market after being implicated in the deaths of four patients and in theliver damage suffered by eight others. The story is also flagged in the WSJ'sfront-page news box and runs inside at the WP . The NYT says theFDA pulled the drug while USAT , the Wall Street Journal and the WP say the drug'smanufacturer took the action. The papers all observe this is the latest in astring of prescription drug recalls, raising the issue of whether such drugsare now being allowed to come to market too fast.            The LAT front reports that at a time when South Korea has been takinga softer line regarding North Korea, a midget North Korean submarine of thesort often used in spy missions has been captured off the South Korean coast.The story runs inside at the NYT and WP .            With stories inside, the WP and NYT report that Russia has agreed to sell India two commercial nuclear powerreactors. The State Department has already complained to the Russiangovernment.            According to the WSJ main "Politics and Policy" piece, one ofPresident Clinton's chief goals for his upcoming nine-day China trip, the firstby a U.S. president since the Tiananmen Square massacre, is to get Americansback home to see via the television coverage that a changing modern China canbe their ally and best customer. That coverage, observes the Journal ,will be beamed by the very Chinese-launched U.S. satellites at the center ofthe latest Clinton scandal.            The WP reports that a legal tussle between a Washington, D.C.bookstore and Kenneth Starr over a subpoena of records of Monica Lewinsky'spurchases there has been avoided: Lewinsky has agreed to provide the information to Starr.This is not, notes the Post , the first time Lewinsky has cooperated withthe independent counsel. She previously allowed her apartment to be searchedand provided handwriting samples.            According to the Journal 's "Work Week" column, a survey indicatesthat more than half of all U.S. doctors feel insecure about their financialfuture. On average, the docs surveyed were worth more than half a milliondollars.
