Monday's Question (No.352)--"Pro and Context":                                       Some key words in a story in yesterday's New York Times were:jumping jack; youngest; "Dream Catchers"; dreamy, romantic, and elegant; aflip, a toe loop, and a salchow. What was the story about?                        "DickButton's sex life."-- Larry Amoros                        "Ithink the campaign to rehabilitate Sen. Joseph McCarthy has gotten a little outof hand."-- Andrew Staples                        "Idon't care how 'zesty, light, and delectable' it is, Molly O'Neill's recipe foralmond butter tart is just too damn difficult."-- Tim Carvell                        "A newbreakout of that flesh-eating virus. But they tried to kind of, you know,lighten it up."-- Francis Heaney                        "Whatever it was, at least we can delight in the fact that Abe Rosenthal didn'twrite it."-- David Ballard                        Clickfor more answers.                           Randy's Wrap-Up                        The pose and the proseof journalists have changed since Ben Hecht's The Front Page . Indeed,Hecht's reporters would have balked at being called "journalists." Whether theshift from Hildy Johnson to Abe Rosenthal was a good or bad thing, it must benoted that not even Rosenthal's most passionate detractors have ever accusedhim of being a fictional character or of writing a sentence like "Crushing allChechen resistance, Russian troops made their dreamy, romantic, and elegant wayto the outskirts of Grozny." Although there are certainly News Quizparticipants who'd pay to see him perform a flip, a toe loop, and a salchow,whatever they are, on a rocket-powered hell-cycle leaping a wall of fire. Orfailing to leap a wall of fire. Like in the old days in Chicago when  oh, whoare we kidding? We miss him, damn it!                           Low Coefficient ofFriction and Wit Answer                        The story was about ice-skating.            By winning the Metabolife World Professional FigureSkating Championship, 15-year-old Tara Lipinski became the youngestprofessional figure skating champion ever, male or female.            Tara Lipinski is unambiguously female. But neithera boy nor a girl ever won a professional championship at a younger age thanshe. As you all no doubt understood all along. I'm going to stopover-explaining now. No, now.            According toTimes reporter Frank Litsky, Lipinski is a jumping jack. The music sheskated to is called "Dream Catchers." Both the skating and the title song weredreamy, romantic, and elegant. Flip, loop, and salchow are the names of thetriple jumps she performed, although--and I don't claim to know anything aboutfigure skating--they'd also make good names for cartoon squirrels, male orfemale.

But, benefit of the doubt,presumably some of the ads are not intended to sell products so much as toinstill a frisson of imaginary consumption, the sort of shoppingpornography that makes all of us so moist each December.
