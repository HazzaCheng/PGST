                                 More Money! New Money!            Today's leads splay in all directions. USA Today goes with the rampage of Hurricane Georgesthrough the Caribbean. Nearly 200 people are dead, and the powerful storm isnow headed for the Florida Keys. A four-column Washington Post lead reports that lawyers for PresidentClinton and Paula Jones are negotiating for a financial settlement of Jones'sexual harassment suit which is now on appeal. The New YorkTimes leads with favorable new polls for the Clinton camp: ANYT /CBS poll shows that the President's approval ratings have risensince the release of his videotaped grand jury testimony. A backlash may be inthe works against Republicans who favored releasing the tape. (A different pollanalyzed on USAT 's front reaches similar conclusions: Just 29% of votersnow would opt for Clinton's removal, down from 35% last Sunday.)            The LosAngeles Times leads with the bill passed Thursday by the House thatwould grant temporary visas to up to 142,500 additional foreign workers withhigh-tech skills. This bill, which would be effective during the next threeyears, has particular relevance for Silicon Valley and technology firms basedin the west. The Clinton administration, citing the need to protect domesticlabor, worked several compromises into the bill, including a provision whichdiverts a portion of the visa revenues to funds to aid U.S. workers. Themeasure is expected to be passed by the Senate and signed into law.            The WP 's lead cites "sources familiar with the situation" on thePaula Jones lawsuit as saying that Clinton and Jones lawyers have discussed asettlement "in the range that the two sides contemplated during pastnegotiations"--i.e. between $700,000 and $900,000. The NYT , which alsofronts the story, gets much more specific. Citing the lawyers themselves assources, the Times reports that Jones' lawyers initiated the discussionlast week and proposed a $1 million settlement. Robert Bennett, Clinton'sprivate lawyer, counter-offered $500,000, and negotiations are proceedingapace. The impetus to settle comes because Paula Jones' appeal will be heard inmid-October; Jones views the Lewinsky revelations as a possible asset to hersuit.            In other Lewinsky developments, the House Judiciary Committee set atentative schedule for impeachment hearings. The Committee will vote on October5 or 6 about whether to launch an impeachment inquiry; if yes, then the Housewill vote on the measure very shortly thereafter. Amidst the developments, theNYT detects mayhem among the House Republicans. House Speaker NewtGingrich and House Judiciary Committee chair Henry Hyde are tripping over oneanother's leadership initiatives--"a classic case of too many chiefs,"commented another Republican Representative.            The NYT and LAT both report in front-page stories that India'sPrime Minister announced Thursday at the U.N. that India will sign aninternational treaty banning nuclear testing within one year. India'sannouncement follows a similar pledge Wednesday by Pakistan.            Everybody but the LAT fronts the new padding for Americanpocketbooks. According to a Census Bureau report released Thursday, income forthe average household has risen since 1996 (outstripping inflation by a rate ofnearly 2:1), and the poverty rate has declined. Significantly, the number ofblack and Hispanic households below the poverty line decreased. Nonetheless,the papers note, this does not mitigate the long-term trend toward inequality:the top 20% of households still control 50% of the wealth.            Speaking of money, the WP pays tribute inside to the new $20 bills.The Treasury Department launched the first of $40 billion worth of redesigned$20 greenbacks yesterday. The objective? To foil counterfeiters. (The old $20strailed only the $1 bills as a counterfeit cinch.) But the new $20s might notbring Coke cans and subway tokens tumbling out of vending machines just yet:The machines must be reconfigured to accept the new bills.            The Wall Street Journal tries to decipher the bafflingmarketing phenomenon of Beanie Babies. These "little stuffed critters," worth$5.95, have been flagged among disciples as rare and valuable collector'sitems. As a result, some manic Beanie speculators value their collections atupward of $100,000. But there is growing fear that the Beanie phenomenon may beon the verge of collapse either as new rival toys flood the market or, morelikely, when collectors click their heels three times and realize that theirclosets are cluttered with stuffed toys.
