                                 Hillary and Di            Hillary Rodham Clinton hasbeen devoted to Causes all her adult life. Apart from her family, improving theworld (by her lights) is what she is about. For Princess Diana, Causes weremore than a royal-lifestyle accessory but less than a lifelong passion. Eachwoman married into a huge opportunity to advance her Causes. And yet Hillary,the born Causenik, has been far less successful--both for her Causes and forherself.            As theofficial American representative at the princess's funeral, the first lady musthave wondered why a small fraction of the outpouring of affection for England'smost famous woman couldn't attach itself to this country's most famous woman.Millions of dollars and pounds pour in daily for Diana's favorite charities.Hillary, meanwhile, prepares to co-chair a new Conference on Child Care--aprospect that must make her feel at least a small fraction as weary as everyoneelse.            It is hard to remember while in the grip of posthumousamnesia, but Diana's press was often as lousy as Hillary's. The media mockedher outsized clothes budget, her downsized tank tops, her affairs, her variousdysfunctions, her penchant for New Age cures. The National Enquirerpulled its "Di Was Sex Mad" cover off newsstands as soon as it could after thefatal crash. Even the nontabloid London Sunday Times had the headline"Diana on the Couch"--above a story questioning the princess's mentalstability--in the edition that hit British doorsteps (too late to stop) a fewhours after her death.            Both womensuffered the indignity of a press obsession with their thighs. Photos from theClintons' recent Martha's Vineyard vacation featured Hillary in a bathing suitwith close-ups of her legs. You would think that the thighs of a woman ofDiana's years would yield little in the way of news. But her gym sold photos ofher gams to Fleet Street. Her dimpled cellulite was blown up to ghastlyproportions and plastered on newsstands.            But Diana was wiser about how to transcend hertormenters. First, she knew not to trouble her pretty little head about mattersof institutional power. It could only slow her down. When she successfully putland mines on the world's agenda, she didn't do it by going to the UnitedNations or 10 Downing St., but to the places where the mines had done theirghastly damage. She posed for the photographers, uttered some clichs, andshared her glamour. But it worked.            Bycontrast, Mrs. Clinton believed that this feminine approach was old-fashioned,and went after executive authority like the boys. She got bogged down inleading a 500-member Health Care Task Force and fighting with subcommitteechairmen on the Hill. And it's not a question of physical beauty: EleanorRoosevelt also took the Diana approach and got results. When she wantedsomething to be done about conditions in the mines, she went to (and posed at)the mines, not to the Bureau of Mines.            Diana's second lesson for Hillary is the one she deliveredto the royal family: Flex that upper lip. There was a great deal more sympathyfor Diana's frailties, once she admitted to them, than the press--bad judges ofhow readers will process embarrassing revelations--predicted. At a particularlylow point after the Squidgy tapes, Diana went on the BBC for a two-hourinterview. Her private secretary was so appalled over it that he quit, and themedia's assessment was summed up in one paper's headline, "Has She Gone Mad?"But politicians in trouble should pore over that tape for guidance in spincontrol. With that unfiltered performance, her triumph over the House ofWindsor was ensured.            Hillaryonce made a similar appearance, one that has become known as the "pressconference in pink." During the simultaneous controversies over the health caretask force, her killing in cattle futures, and her alleged meddling in theWhite House travel office, she invited reporters into the East Room to hear herexplain herself. But by giving absolutely no ground, she gained no sympathy:Everyone thought she was smart, but no one was reminded she was human. BillClinton has admitted to causing "pain in my marriage," but his wife has nevergiven the slightest indication she feels any.            Of course, there's the fear that a woman--evena woman whose public role derives entirely from her husband--won't be takenseriously if her portfolio is more princess than prime minister. While Dianawas more fame than substance, she accomplished a lot with her 15 minutes onceshe had it. Land mines made it onto the world's agenda because Diana put themthere, using only the cameras and good will at her disposal. Meanwhile, inAmerica, there are still 47 million people with no health insurance.
