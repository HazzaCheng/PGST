                                 Jesuitical vs. Talmudic            An exchange occurred notlong ago in California's Sacramento Superior and Municipal Courts. As a lawyerattempted to excuse his client's behavior with a convoluted explanation, JudgeJames Ford interrupted acidly with the comment, "That's just ... that's justtoo Jesuitical for words." The colloquy continued as follows:                                        Lawyer: "Pardon me?"                                                    Judge: "It's too Jesuitical . You probably didn't go to aJesuit school."                                                    Lawyer: "Certainly didn't. I am of the Jewish faith."                                                    Judge: "Then it's too Talmudic for words."                        One can almost hear the appreciative chuckles from thespectators' gallery at this bit of repartee--the overreactive,tension-dispelling response that very mild witticisms tend to produce in solemnvenues. And yet someone should have risen to say, "Objection!" It is common toregard "Jesuitical" and "Talmudic" as synonymous, but this does an injustice toboth words.            "Talmudic" originally signified nothing more than "of or pertaining to theTalmud" ( Oxford English Dictionary ), the Talmud being the postbiblicalRabbinic code of Jewish laws and interpretations that is the source ofauthority in Orthodox Judaism. "Jesuitical" originally signified "of orpertaining to the Jesuits; belonging to the Society of Jesus; Jesuit"( OED , again), the Jesuits being the Roman Catholic clerical orderfounded by Ignatius Loyola in 1534 as an intellectual bulwark against theReformation. Whatever else may be said about them, both "Talmudic" and"Jesuitical" carry connotations of great learning and meticulous attention toargument. Where they diverge is in motivation.            Very early, owing in part to English Protestantpropagandists, the word "Jesuitical" came to characterize a form of argumentdesigned less to seek the truth than to make a case, a form of argument thatwas aggressive and clever but perhaps not always sincere--indeed, one that wasat times cunningly equivocal or downright deceitful. Aside from pureanti-Jesuit animus, this nuance probably arose from the work of some17th-century Jesuit theologians who imperfectly employed a method known as"casuistry" in resolving questions of moral theology--an approach that gave thebroadest possible leeway to individual behavior. This form of justification,which became known as "laxism," may explain why Jesuit priests were theconfessors of choice among Europe's Catholic aristocracy.            To characterize a lie asan "economy of truth" would be a Jesuitical formulation. To say that one hadsmoked marijuana but did not inhale would be a Jesuitical distinction. (BillClinton received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, a Jesuitschool.) William Safire argues that "Jesuitical" has by now developed a sensedevoid of any overtones of prevarication: "subtle, intricate, moralisticreasoning, informed by a rigorous logic" is his definition. I am not assanguine as Safire, and believe that using the word will always carry someslight risk: It may be wielded as a slur and received as a compliment, or viceversa.            "Talmudic" carries none ofthis baggage. The Talmud, with its commentaries on the Torah and itscommentaries on the commentaries (the process goes on and on) cannot be faultedfor using guile to arrive at a congenial "truth." But the word has its ownnegative connotations. Talmudic scholarship is famous for the tortuous andpainstaking manner in which truth is pursued and established--if it can beestablished at all. It is assumed by Talmudic scholars that the language of theTalmud is precise, and that each word is therefore of surpassing significance.As a result, even infinitesimal details are treated with the utmostseriousness. Also, while Talmudic scholarship is sometimes aimed at practicalaffairs (for instance, civil and criminal law, dietary laws, the status ofwomen), it also considers issues that have no practical application at all, andsometimes delves into matters that may seem utterly fanciful.            In hisbook The Essential Talmud , rabbi and scholar Adin Steinsaltz recounts afamous absurdist parody: A rabbi asked his disciple why the letter peh (p
