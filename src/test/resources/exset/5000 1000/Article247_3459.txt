                                 Questions and Answers                        Issue 1 is Gov. George W. Bush and the rumors that he snorted cocaine whenhe was in his 20s. Pundits also spend a few moments discussing the politicalstrengths and weaknesses of Elizabeth Dole, John McCain, and other GOPpresidential candidates; the Clinton marriage and the political standing of thepresident and the first lady; and the news, reported this week, that KennethStarr might wrap up his multi-year investigation of the Clinton White House andleave his job as independent counsel.            Most pundits agree that questions about whether Bush has ever tried cocaineare relevant to this year's presidential campaign and a legitimate part ofpublic discourse. They also agree that the imbroglio in which Bush now findshimself will probably not severely damage the Bush election effort. GeorgeStephanopoulos (ABC's This Week ) and David Gergen (NBC's Meet thePress ) believe that unless someone comes forward with a specific allegationabout Bush using drugs the issue will likely fade from public notice. Bob Novak(CNN's Capital Gang ) believes that the current Bush position--that hehas been drug-free since 1974--is an eminently reasonable one, and otherpundits point out that the American public simply does not care a great dealabout whether, as a young man in his 20s, George W. Bush dabbled in thedrug.            Still, pundits are highly critical of Bush's handling of the cocaine issue.They believe it raises serious questions about the character and credibility ofthe Texas governor, and they accuse Bush of giving a series of muddledresponses to questions about drug use as a youth. They attack him for soundinglike Bill Clinton, who in 1992 evaded questions about drug use anddraft-dodging in an eerily similar manner. And they argue that Bush, who hasrefused to state flat-out if he has ever used illegal drugs, emerges from thecontroversy looking like a waffler and, worst of all, a hypocrite of the firstorder.            As Paul Gigot (PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ), Susan Page (CNN'sLate Edition ), and other pundits explain it, Bush is running a campaignbased in large part on his personal biography. He has trumpeted his credentialsas a faithful husband and fine father, volunteered to reporters that he nolonger drinks, and attacked Clinton for being an immoral philanderer who hastarnished the dignity of the Oval Office. Bush has promised that as presidenthe would uphold the dignity of that office, and pundits wonder how he can talkabout some aspects of his personal life without discussing other, less pleasantparts of his past. Also, as Gergen and other pundits point out, Bush may have atough time squaring his own past drug use with his image as a law-and-ordertough who supports stiffer sentencing guidelines for convicted drugoffenders.            This week Paul Duke, the moderator on Washington Week in Review ,warns viewers that in Washington the past week has been a "dead" one. Andindeed, other than the Bush cocaine controversy, the opinion mafia has littleto say this week that is new: George Will ( This Week ) attacks JohnMcCain for being a waffler on the abortion issue. Gigot says Elizabeth Dole isrunning a listless campaign and needs to start focusing on major issues ofpublic concern. Margaret Carlson ( Capital Gang ) and Chris Black ( LateEdition ), speaking from Martha's Vineyard, where the Clintons arevacationing, marvel at how Clinton has rebounded from the Lewinsky scandal of ayear earlier. And Karen Tumulty and Brit Hume ( Fox News Sunday ) engagein a heated debate about the merits of Ken Starr and his lengthy investigationinto wrongdoing in the Clinton White House. Hume says the independent counselalmost brought down a president and has been, by most measurements, asuccessful prosecutor. Tumulty thinks Starr a failure.                           Infotainment, Fox-style:                Fox News Sunday routinely airssensational, 15-second spots that titillate viewers and try to convince them tostay tuned for upcoming segments. This week the producers at Fox News advertisean upcoming dialogue on the Bush cocaine controversy by playing the popular'80s dance song "White Lines" and showing footage of a protester running acrossa street carrying a sign that reads, "Snort."
