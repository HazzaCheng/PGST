                                 Incomplete Sentences                           USAToday and the New YorkTimes lead with the passage of a major IRS overhaul. The Washington Post goes with Big Tobacco's negotiations withnumerous states in an attempt to settle their claims, which remain in the wakeof Congress' failure to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation. The LAT leadswith the California Supreme Court's ruling that women may not sue Dow ChemicalCo. for any alleged harm caused by its breast implant subsidiary Dow CorningCorp. The paper points out this limits implant plaintiffs to a share of thepool of money in the Dow Corning settlement announced Wednesday. None of theother leads even makes the Los Angeles Times 's front--hey, it's the SiliconeValley.            Both IRS leads supply the bill's basic facts: it establishes an outsideboard designed to trim the agency's powers and shifts the burden of proof intax cases from the filer to the IRS. And both have the tacked-on provisionshortening the holding period required for the optimal tax treatment of capitalgains (although only USAT mentions that this will cost $13 billion overthe next decade.) The NYT gets into details about the organizationaloverhaul that USAT does not. On the other hand, who do you think gave aclearer account of the president's Gumbyesque history with the bill? TheNYT says, "Although the administration had opposed the bill in its earlystages last year, the measure built up unstoppable momentum after a series ofhearings in the Senate Finance Committee laid out horror stories fromtaxpayers..." while USAT puts it thus: "Clinton, who initially resistedthe overhaul, now says he looks forward to signing the bill."            The tobacco/states talks broke up Wednesday, the WP reports, over thestates' demands for an up-front payment of about $20 billion, twice the amountthe companies offered in last year's negotiated settlement, left in limbo bythe failure of the Congress to implement it. But, the paper points out, thereis certainly pressure to continue talking: in the form of more bills in themaking that could hit the cigarette companies with a large tax surcharge.            Yesterday Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson were respectively sentenced to 2 and 2 years in connection with the death of their newborn at a Delawaremotel. Compare the two front-page headlines on the story: WP : "PairWhose Baby Was Left in Trash Get Short Terms" and NYT : "Teen-Agers GetTerms in Prison in Baby's Death." Doesn't the Post headline bettercommunicate the gravity of the action and the incommensurability of thesentence?            The NYT runs an AP story inside reporting that a Miami executive wascharged with soliciting $20,000 in foreign contributions to Democratic electioncampaigns. The story doesn't mention what the Post tips in the headlineof its version and plays high up in the body: that the man is a friend of AlGore.            The WallStreet Journal "Washington Wire" reports that three separate suicidesby Navy officers in and around Washington in recent months have the servicerattled.            "Today's Papers" wants to make a clean breast of the mistake it madeyesterday, when it guessed that the WSJ had not made a fuss about theDow Corning implant settlement because the news broke after the paper went tobed. Actually, the paper didn't have to make a fuss--it had the story the day*before.*            At yesterday's afternoon Page One meeting, the editorial top guns at theNYT were rightly wowed by the stellar photograph that graces the topfront this morning. It's a geometrically pleasing and emotionally chargedpicture of two sons at their firefighter father's funeral. After all theexpense and complications the Times has experienced putting colorpictures on the front page, it might be a little difficult for the brass toadmit that the picture has something else going for it: its main colors areblue and white, giving it the moody feel of...B&W.
