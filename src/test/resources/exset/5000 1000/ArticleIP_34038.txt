Albert Brooks'new film--which he directed, co-wrote, and stars in--is "good but not greatBrooks" (Roger Ebert, the Chicago Sun-Times ). The plot: A screenwriter(Brooks) has lost his edge, and he enlists the aid of a muse (Sharon Stone) toinspire him. However, Hollywood being Hollywood, this muse requires a suite atthe Four Seasons and gifts from Tiffany's to keep her going. Janet Maslin (theNew York Times ) positively glows for the film, calling it a "mordantlyhilarious cri de coeur ." But most critics aren't so enchanted: Although"there are lots of punchy lines," the "one-joke movie doesn't have all thatmuch to say" (Susan Wloszczyna, USA Today ).

It's a"genial" film with "lots of broad slapstick humor that kids like and adultswince at" (Ebert, the Chicago Sun-Times ). A few critics are outrightirritated--it "disappoints in every way possible," says Kenneth Turan (theLos Angeles Times )--but most are just mildly annoyed. Maslin, however,gives the film a surprisingly upbeat review, admiring its "appealingtry-anything spirit" and noting that it "works well as family entertainment"(the New York Times ).

The                                                Astronaut's Wife                (New Line Cinema).The final entry in a week of blah movies is one Universal wouldn't preview forcritics, presumably to postpone the bad reviews for a few days. Now that it'sin theaters, the pans are pouring in for this "ridiculously derivative" movie(Maslin, the New York Times ) about an astronaut (Johnny Depp) whoreturns to Earth after a strange, and possibly alien, encounter in space. Hiswife (Charlize Theron) is now pregnant--and sporting the same hairdo Mia Farrowwore in Rosemary's Baby --and must determine what has happened to hubbyand what to do about it. "Instead of a movie about aliens, The Astronaut'sWife seems like a movie made by aliens" (Andy Selier, USA Today ).(Click here to find out more about Theron.)                           Books                                                         Headlong                                                : A Novel               , by Michael Frayn(Metropolitan Books). Strong notices for the British novelist and playwright'slatest, a story that "engagingly combines a comedy of manners with elements offarce and art-historical detective story" (Matt Seaton, the New YorkTimes ). The main character, a philosophy professor, stumbles on what hebelieves to be a lost Bruegel painting and becomes obsessed with both obtainingit and determining whether it is genuine. Along the way the reader gets a"fascinating tour through the intellectual thickets of Bruegel scholarship"that manages to be "as entertaining as it is intelligent, as stimulating as itis funny" (Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times ). PublishersWeekly finds all the art history tiresome, as it has the side effect of"entirely halting [Frayn's] promising frolicsome narrative."

Gleick, whose two previousbooks were nominated for National Book Awards, gets positive but passionlessreviews for his rumination on the speed of contemporary life. AlthoughFaster is full of interesting details of how the brain perceives timeand how technology both steals and adds minutes to our lives, several criticsnote that Gleick never makes a definitive conclusion about the data he hascollected. "[W]hy is it that whenever humans are given the choice, we opt forfaster? Mr. Gleick fights shy of this big question. That is disappointing, ifonly because we have such high expectations from this author" (Jim Holt, theWall Street Journal ). It's "as if Gleick couldn't quite make the shortleap from being merely a superb reporter to an astute social thinker" (HenryKisor, the Chicago Sun-Times ).
