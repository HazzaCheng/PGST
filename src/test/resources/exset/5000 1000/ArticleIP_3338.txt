                                 Europa            Translated by DavidFerry                                        (posted Tuesday, July16; to be composted Tuesday, July 23)                        May badpeople see bad omens everywhere,            The screechof an owl, the sight of a pregnant dog,            Or a greyshe-wolf running across a field,            Or maybe afox that's lately dropped her litter;                         Or may theysee a serpent like an arrow            Slitherobliquely across, scaring the horses.            My prayerswill make good omens for good people.            I'll lookto the east and call upon the raven                         To singgood fortune to come to those I fear for,            Before hehas a chance to fly to the west,            To thestanding pools, to prophesy bad weather.            Wherever itis your heart desires to go,                         Go safelythere and be happy, Galatea,            Rememberingwith pleasure how we were.            Let nosinister magpie say you nay            Nor anywandering crow forbid your journey.                         But you cansee the tumult in the sky            When angryOrion sets. You know how black            TheAdriatic can be, and what can go wrong            Even whenlapyx the favoring West Wind blows.                         O rathermay our enemies' wives and children            Experiencethe unexpected gales            The SouthWind brings upon them, the roaring of            Theblackening waters, the sound of the pounding surf                         Shaking thebeaches. Thus it was for Europa,            Entrustingthe safety of her snow-white body            To the notto be trusted bull when in the very            Moment ofher departure she was aghast                         At themidnight sea swarming with terrible monsters.            She who hadonly a moment before that been            A pupil ofthe flowers of the fields            And aweaver of the garlands of the nymphs,                         Now all shesaw in the blackness of the night            Were thewaves of the sea and the faint light of stars.            At last shefound herself upon the shore            Of themighty hundred-citied island of Crete                         And criedout to her father, "Father, I,            Who leftbehind my name and daughterly duty,            Whatmadness was it that came over me?            Where am Inow? Where is it I have come from?                         One deathalone is too little for such as I--            Am I in mysenses, deploring the deed I did?--            Or didn't Ido it? Was it some empty phantom            That flewup through the ivory gate of lies?--                         Which wasit better to do? To do as I did,            To fly herethrough the darkness over the waves--            Or stayback there in the field, gathering flowers?--            If thatyoung bull were here before me now                         I'd strikeinto its hide with avenging steel            And breakthe horns I lately hung with flowers.            Shameless Ileft the gods of my father's house.            Shameless Iwait for Orcus to take me away.                         If thereare any gods who listen to me,            While stillmy beauty remains, send me, naked,            Out amonglions, let me be eaten by tigers,            Beforethese fresh cheeks wither." "Vilest Europa,"                         The voiceof her father says from far away,            "Why do youput off dying? There is a tree,            Anash-tree, near, to hand yourself upon            With thesilken sash you luckily brought with you.                         Unless,that is, the jagged rocks that lie            At thebottom of yonder cliff would please you better,            If that isso, just give yourself to the wind,            A royalprincess otherwise fated to be                         A slavehandmaiden to some savage queen."            Europawept. Quite suddenly, there stood Venus,            Heartlesslylaughing and laughing, and with her her son,            With hisbow unstrung, and when Venus had laughed enough                         She aid,"Dry up your tears and quell your rage            When thebull presents its horns for you to break.            Europa, youare the bride of Jupiter.            Learn howto bear your great good fortune, for                         A region ofthe world is named for you."
