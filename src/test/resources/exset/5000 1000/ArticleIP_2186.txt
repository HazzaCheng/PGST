                                                            Slate: AFashion Statement                        We certainly don't intend tobe a magazine of fashion, either in the sense of being about clothing or in thesense of following the fashion in general matters. Yet, by one of those weirdcoincidences that less scrupulous publications sometimes turn into "specialissues," we have posted two features relating to fashion (in the clothingsense) this week, and will post a third Wednesday.            Our "Letter FromWashington" concerns an admirable (but possibly doomed) campaign to improvethe style sense on the Microsoft campus. Our "Tangled Web"column reports on (and follows, through links) the bizarre theories bouncingaround the Internet about the unlikely figure of Tommy Hilfiger, producer ofsomewhat mysterious ads in many magazines and, apparently, of a line ofclothing as well. Wednesday (April 16) brings "Clothes Sense," our regularmonthly column from Anne Hollander. Anne's subject this month isn't exactlyclothes--she writes about a show of Cartier jewelry at the Metropolitan Museumof Art in New York. But that's still fashion.            You wouldassume, from this onslaught of sartorial hectoring, that the staff of Slatemust dress in exquisite taste. And you would be correct. Any one of us could betransported from this sylvan landscape in Redmond, Wash., strewn with cowchips, computer chips, and potato chips, to the haughty elevators of the CondNast Building on Madison Avenue, and instantly fit right in--stylewise, atleast. We pride ourselves on our fabrics. The staffs of other magazines havespats; we wear them. Other magazines employ heels; we wear them. Not long ago,Bill Gates saw one of Slate's program managers, Peter Randall, walking acrossthe campus, and observed, to no one in particular, "I'd kill for that tie." Butthat turned out not to be necessary.                           LawyerCake                        If you haven't checked insince last week, two new "Dialogues" have started. And a couple more might havestarted by the time you read this. Ronald Dworkin, professor of jurisprudenceat Oxford, is debating assisted suicide with Michael McConnell, who recently leftthe University of Chicago Law School for the University of Utah. Peter Edelman,a former Clinton-administration official who has become the most vocal criticof the welfare reform President Clinton signed last year, is beingchallenged by Mickey Kaus, author of The End of Equality , who supportsthe reform. Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School will be engaging Akhil ReedAmar of Yale Law School on whether the truth gets short shrift in America'scriminal-justice system. (Dershowitz recently reviewed Amar's book on this subjectfor Slate.) And Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, will beengaging Wendell Willkie II, general counsel of the Commerce Department underGeorge Bush, on the subject of human rights and trade with China.            Coming soon: Undersecretaryof State Strobe Talbott and the managing editor of Foreign Affairs ,Fareed Zakaria, on U.S. support for the expansion of NATO. (Read our recent"Gist" on thissubject if you need to get up to speed.)            These dialogues, conducted bye-mail, are fulfilling our hope that they would develop into a new mode ofcivilized debate. E-mail (at its best) combines the immediacy of talking withthe reflectiveness of writing. It also seems to lend itself--more than "live"debates--to actual dialectical progress. Slate's dialogues tend to feature notjust thesis and antithesis, but a bit of synthesis as well. (Occasionally, ofcourse, a dialogue serves to reveal the utter superiority of one side of theargument, as in the recent discussion of the capital-gainstax.)            Often, we've discovered, thebest way to frame an interesting and useful dialogue is not to get a liberalvs. a conservative, but to get two people from roughly the same part of thespectrum who disagree on the application of their shared values to a particularissue. In our current lineup, Willkie and Bauer are both conservatives, whileDershowitz and Amar are both liberals. But we're not beyond the occasionalideological dust-up, such as the recently concluded exchange on divorce between Katha Pollitt and David Blankenhorn.            We do seemto end up with a lot of lawyers. Sorry about that.            -- MichaelKinsley
