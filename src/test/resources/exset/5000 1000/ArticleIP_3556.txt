DearPrudie,                                                      I haveno problem of a personal nature at the moment. What I do have is a societalirritation. Not only the young but also adults who are professionalbroadcasters have taken to ending declarative sentences as though they werequestions. Have you heard this irritating "modernization"? How did experiencedradio and TV people of both genders turn into Valley Girls, and do you knowwhere this annoying development came from?                                       --Earache inAtlanta                        DearEar,            Prudie isrelieved that you are not in distress of a personal nature and hopes it is somecomfort to you that she herself regards this way of speaking as revolting? Itis called "up talk," and if Prudie knew its instigator she would slowly twisthis question mark until it hurt. This raising of the voice at the end of adeclarative sentence is the unfortunate result of trying to fluff up somethingthat needs no fluffing: correct speech.            --Prudie,declaratively                                             DearPrudie,                                                      Are youhearing anything about Viagra from your readers? Do you have any thoughts onthe subject?                                       --Leonard inPortland                        DearLen,            Prudie is hearing a greatdeal about Viagra--but mercifully not from her readers.            As for Prudie's thoughts, sheis sick of the subject, and to distract herself from the pharmacological dramagoing on she is entertained by imagining the drug being given to Dr. JudahFolkman's mice.            Do not misunderstand. Peopleof good will cannot begrudge those in genuine need, but the V pill is on itsway to becoming a recreational drug, thereby creating ersatz libido, andthereby creating God only knows what problems.            Prudiealso thinks the name unfortunate, sounding, as it does, like the well-knownfertilizer.            --Prudie, dismissively                                             DearPrudence,                                                      I needto know how to ask if someone is pregnant without giving offense if they'renot. A casual (married) acquaintance of mine appears to be showing but not in amanner in which one can be certain. I suppose I could wait her out, but I wantto start gossiping as soon as possible.                                       --Love,NaturallyCurious in Washington                        DearNat,            Prudie once made the mistakeof asking the question you have in mind. My unfortunate query elicited thisresponse: "I have a problem with my weight, and you have just ruined myday."            The onlypossibilities other than baby are obesity or a tumor--neither of which needsremarking on. And your use of the words "casual acquaintance" makes Prudiecertain that you should ask no questions and put the gossip on hold.            --Prudie, privately                                             DearPrudie,                                                      I can hardly believe I amhaving this problem in this day and age. I am in my late 20s and in a seriousrelationship. We are discussing marriage, but he has one concern: his mother's,shall we say, "views." It seems my maybe-future mother-in-law is all caught upin ancestors, social pedigree, and similarly irrelevant issues. My boyfriend isafraid she will not welcome me with open arms out of fear her son will wind upout of the Social Register.                                       What isto be done?                                       --No DAR                        Dear No,            Prudie has zero tolerance forthis kind of thinking and, as a matter of fact, has always considered theSocial Register the American Kennel Club for humans.            Yourimmediate determination is whether your beau shares his mother's views. If heis afraid of her disapproval, he will surely be substandard husband material.If he is not wholeheartedly in your corner on this one, say adios and look forsomeone who will not regard you as the little match girl.            --Prudie,democratically
