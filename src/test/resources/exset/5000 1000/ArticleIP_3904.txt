Don'tGive Me That                        AnnCastle deserves congratulations for her prodigious compendiumof philanthropic donations in the "                  Slate                60." But it's simply nottrue, as Jodie T. Allen asserts in her introduction, that the                  Slate                60 is the first list of its kind. I compiled what I believeis the first list of "Most Generous Living Americans" for Town &Country magazine in December 1983. Three years later (December 1986), Iupdated that same list. And in December 1989, for the same magazine, I compileda list of "Most Generous Living Americans" under age 50. Thanks for setting therecord straight.            -- DanRottenberg Philadelphia                           New NewsIs Good News                        "Fiddling Around,"Emily Yoffe's assessment of differences between reporting in the '60s and the'90s, overlooks one important issue--media distribution. In the '60s, thenational media was censored by a small handful of gatekeepers. Any news outsidethe established national news held relatively little credibility in comparison,and therefore held little influence. Since the '60s, the number of nationalnews distributors has grown tremendously. National print magazines, cable andsatellite news, and of course Internet distribution put the news into thenation's living rooms too quickly to be entirely monitored by the old guard.There was never a better demonstration of this shift in media distribution thanthe Monica Lewinsky story, which would have died in the hands ofNewsweek were it not for the Drudge Report .            -- Bill Muscato                                       Prejudice at 160 MPH                        As a New Yorker born andraised, I must confess to a visceral appreciation for petty jabs atSoutherners, "good ol' boys," or other similar cultural unknowns. SethStevenson's "Dispatch" from a recent NASCAR race, however, illustrates howeasily such "harmless" prejudices collapse into crude stereotypes.            When the crowd rises andgasps after a wreck, Stevenson notes that they all, including himself, are"hoping for a violent accident." Some fans may harbor such wishes. For all Iknow, some hockey fans go for the fights. Most race fans, though--real ones,not Stevenson's cartoonish inventions--react to the wrecks for differentreasons. First, wrecks usually knock the victims out of the race, itself adramatic event. Second, it is exciting and even encouraging to watch one's herosmack a concrete wall at such high speeds and walk away unscathed. Most fansprefer that such wrecks not occur, but when they do, fans pay justifiably closeattention to the driver's fate. The flashy team apparel, etc., send a relevantmessage--the fans really care about the drivers. A lot.            Stevenson's eagerness forviolence is his own business; he should not presume the same of others. DidStevenson speak with any of the fans with whose hopes he claimed to be sofamiliar? Virtually all the fans with whom I have spoken over the years (quitea friendly bunch, actually) consider the absence of big wrecks,injuries, etc., a key component of a good race. Stevenson might simply havetrouble believing that mustachioed, tobacco-chewing men wearing big, blackT-shirts can resist the temptation to cry for blood. If so, I'd suggest heattend a future race and talk to some of his section-mates.            There areother reasons that wrecks cause fan excitement--e.g., remaining cars mustcontinue racing to the start/finish line; it releases tension built up overlong green-flag runs. It is sufficient to note, however, that Stevenson wascontent to rely on a mix of his own admitted bloodthirstiness and goodold-fashioned prejudice for his conclusion. I expect better from                  Slate               , and hope that it survived editorial pruning only becauseyou were busy counting your otherwise well-deserved subscription money fromNASCAR fans such as myself (look for my                   Slate                umbrella during thenext rain delay!).            -- GregoryVogelsperger Elmhurst, Ill.
