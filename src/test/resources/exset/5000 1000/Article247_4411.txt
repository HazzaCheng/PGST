                                 Your Pentagon Inaction            The New York Times and Los AngelesTimes lead with the failure last night of a key test of the Pentagon'sprototype anti-missile defense system. The "kill vehicle" was anything but,missing the surrogate incoming warhead 140 miles above the Pacific. USA Todayleads with its latest political poll, which finds that no issue is consideredextremely important by more than 40 percent of the respondents, suggesting thatin the presidential election, the candidates' perceived personal qualities maybe more important than their positions on the issues. The Washington Post goes completely local above the fold, withits top non-local story the Russians' fiercely contested advance into Grozny.(The early editions of the WP and USAT that Today's Papers worksfrom closed before the missile test results had been released.)            The NYT explains that the Pentagon's failed test was the first time the system'santi-missile was evaluated while being governed by a fully integrated system ofsensors. Both Times say there will be only one more test beforePresident Clinton decides up or down on the program. The LAT high upsays that yesterday's failure "measurably increases the odds" that Clinton willchoose not to go ahead with a national missile shield.            On the heels of yesterday's studies from two think tanks suggesting that theincome gap between rich and poor continues to grow, the LAT fronts andthe Wall Street Journal front-indexes similar word todayfrom the Federal Reserve. The difference is that the Fed focused not on incomebut on accumulated wealth. Some of the more striking findings: Although from1995 to 1998 the median family net worth rose from $60,900 to $71,600, themedian family with a main breadwinner younger than 35 saw its net worth shrinkby nearly 30 percent; during that same time span, median family debt rose from$23,000 to $33,300; and the percentage of families that own stock went from31.6 percent in 1989 to 48.8 percent in 1998 and, notes the WSJ , fewerthan 10 percent of American families don't have a checking account. TheWP and NYT stuff the story.            In the half-full, half-empty department, the LAT headline reads,"BOOM TIME A BAD TIME FOR POOREST, STUDY FINDS." The Journal 's reads:"STOCK GAINS PROPEL U.S. WEALTH; MORE AMERICANS OWN SHARES."            The NYT reports that President Clinton announced that he agrees withBill Bradley and Al Gore that the Confederate battle flag should be removedfrom the South Carolina Capitol building. William F. Buckley Jr., in anLAT op-ed, says that the matter should be put to a national plebiscite.Buckley says that the flag doesn't enshrine slavery but rather "nostalgia and asense of Southern idealism and cultural particularism." And he mentions a raftof dead Southern idealists who he thinks might well have voted to keep theCapitol flag in place, but it's significant that he doesn't mention any livingones.

USAT reports on Page 8 a story that in most alternative universeswould have been front-page news: Hillary Rodham Clinton denies that she'llleave her husband when he leaves the presidency. HRC says she will "spend therest of my life" with her husband.            The WP and NYT report that former Angolan rebels say theirleader, Jonas Savimbi, ordered the shoot-down of two U.N. aircraft that crashedmysteriously on separate days just over a year ago, resulting in 22 deaths.            The WP reports that the Department of Justice will announce todaythat it will receive nearly $500 million (enough for five missile tests) tosettle a health-care fraud case it brought against a national chain of kidneydialysis centers. The government alleged that the centers caused Medicare topay for hundreds of thousands of needless tests for patients and had paidkickbacks to obtain referrals.            In a WSJ commentary on the TV networks/drug czar flap, John Podhoretzclaims that the government's attempt to influence the content of shows is"nothing untoward." After all, he observes, the Pentagon reviews scripts allthe time when filmmakers seek to use its facilities and equipment. And thefilmmakers don't protest that the government has exploited them. But one man'smodus ponens is another's modus tollens : The Pentagonscript-vetting process seems outrageous to Today's Papers, all the more sobecause unlike the drug-TV case, all the money and assets involved come frompublic funds. Why should taxpayers only get to see war movies the Pentagonagrees with?
