                                 81 Questions. How Many Answers?            President Clinton's 24-page written affirmation to the House JudiciaryCommittee that he did not lie--though he misled friends and family and is sorryas usual--leads at all papers. In responding to 81 questions posed by theJudiciary Committee, Clinton interspersed numerous "I don't remembers" withshort statements which did not always directly answer the question.            The New York Times writes that Clinton's responses "shed littlenew light on issues surrounding the impeachment inquiry," and the Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes concur. However, despite Clinton's terse and limited responses,he did provide some fresh tidbits for the Committee to mull: The NYTsays that Clinton's responses marked the first time he had acknowledgeddiscussing methods for handling the Lewinsky matter with Dick Morris, hispolitical advisor, shortly after the story broke in January. Clinton also notedfor the first time, says the Times , that his lawyers and reelectioncampaign had hired two private investigators, Terry Lenzner and JackPalladino--though Clinton insists that their investigation was not the "WhiteHouse Secret Police Operation" to scrutinize Clinton's opponents that Morrishas alleged. As an accompaniment to Clinton's statement, David Kendallsubmitted a letter emphasizing that "the president did NOT commit or subornperjury, tamper with witnesses, obstruct justice or abuse power" and thatClinton's response was "in good faith."            The NYT and WP front Friday's confirmation by Exxon and Mobilof their merger discussions (the LAT gives it the Business front). IfExxon took over Mobil--the most likely scenario, experts say--the resultantcompany could be worth $160 billion, says the WP . Though both Exxon andMobil stocks leaped at the news, the WP uses paragraph two to citecautious experts who worry that various factors--among them the "intense,independent personalities of the two firms' chief executives"--could yet derailthe deal. The boards at each company will meet Tuesday to consider theagreement, which would then be subject to anti-trust scrutiny by the FederalTrade Commission. The merged company would be particularly vulnerable toanti-trust charges in its retailing and marketing operations, says theNYT , as opposed to the more competitive exploration and drillingarenas.            All papers run the predictable "It's the day after Thanksgiving and what areshoppers doing?" stories. The WP spotlights the "early-bird" shoppingtrend; the NYT likewise hones in on the bargain hunters, opining that"the 1990s have transformed the holiday shopping experience into one giantnational hunt for deals." The LAT optimistically reports from Southlandthat revved-up shoppers clogging the stores "reinforced a growing belief thatretailers will have a prosperous holiday season this year."            An interesting New York Times "Living Arts" article ponders thepeacemaking--and warmaking--role of non-governmentalorganizations. The Times attributes the increasing involvement ofNGOs to "the growing complexity of the international agenda," advancedtechnology and communications, and declining government involvement in thepost-Cold War era. But how effective are the NGOs? is a question of continuingdebate--all the more pressing because NGOs lack the democratic accountabilitythat governments must face.            The NYT fronts a story on Canterbury's modern-day Pardoner--whoops,make that Pope John Paul II. To usher in the Year 2000, the Pope has declaredthat anyone who quits smoking or drinking (or eating) for one daycan get an "indulgence"--a ticket bypassing purgatorial repentance andsmoothing the way to heaven. Upon reading this, TP hastily cast away the bottleand entered a state of deep and transient sobriety. Alas, that may not beenough--the Papal inner circle insists that it's the spirit of participationthat counts.
