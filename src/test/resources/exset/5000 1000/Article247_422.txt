                                 Bottoms Up            The New York Timesleads with Janet Reno's announcement that she's expanding her inquiry into AlGore's fund-raising phone calls. USA Today leads with the news that juvenile violentcrime has dropped more than 9 percent in the past year, the Los AngelesTimes with the word that the U.S. is likely to OK nuclear power dealsbetween U.S. firms and China, and the Washington Post with the news that President Clinton isabout to propose civilian review boards to oversee the IRS.            The Times reports that while deciding to go forward on Gore, Renorejected the need for an independent counsel to investigate Bill Clinton'sWhite House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom-visit arrangements. Reno has till themiddle of the month before deciding whether or not to expand her inquiry intoClinton's fund-raising phone calls.            The NYT also reveals that one of the attorneys Gore has hired to helpwith his mounting problems is doing the work pro bono. The lawyer , James Neal,says the practice is legal and ethical. The WP front-page piece aboutReno's decision has virtually all the same information, except that thePost missed the Gore-pro bono tidbit.            However, the Post does break ground in a long front-page piece aboutthe disarray surrounding what it calls the DOJ's "crippled" 11-monthinvestigation into White House fund raising. The core problem apparently wasthat the FBI wanted to focus on the president, vice president, and other seniorofficials, but the Justice Department attorneys wanted a "bottom up"investigation. (The DOJ lawyers are defending their point of view in theWall Street Journal 's "Washington Wire," saying thecase against naming a special prosecutor is "pretty strong.") As a result, saysthe paper, the task force didn't even interview senior officials for eightmonths, and the information that may eventually result in the appointment of anindependent counsel came not from the task force but from a "newspaperaccount." (Apparently, modesty is still on the style-sheet at the House ofGraham--that newspaper was the Post .)            The LAT 's story about China's nuke trade opening says that the newU.S. stance comes "amid intensive lobbying by the U.S. nuclear industry." Acompany the paper names as a likely beneficiary is Westinghouse. Also, it isrevealed that the administration's OK will probably be given at Clinton's Cot.28-29 meeting in Washington with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Jesse Helms,the LAT says, criticizes the deal, saying it would stand as a "testamentto the role financial interests play in the U.S. policy toward China." Thestory's details suggest he has a point, inasmuch as it relates that China isstill providing missile and chemical/biological warfare technology to Iran andPakistan.            Meanwhile the front pages of both the WP and the NYT nationaledition state that the Defense Department has given the green light totest-firing a powerful laser at a satellite orbiting some 200-plus miles up.The State Department had been against the idea, particularly because of concernabout what moving forward in this weapons area would do to Russia's attitudetoward the latest arms-reduction treaty, START II, which Russia hasn't ratifiedyet. Both papers reveal that the laser is known by the Strangelovian MIRACL for"Mid-Wave Infrared Chemical Laser." (There's a sneaking suspicion here that theacronym came first, followed by the billions required to make a weapon thatfits it.)            The WSJ explains that U.S. representatives at the Kyotoglobal-warming talks will be singing the praises of pollution credit markets,which, the EPA says, have contributed to a 30-percent drop in sulfur-dioxideemissions here just since 1994. Something this powerful is needed for allgreenhouse gases, since as a chart accompanying the piece points out, the U.S.is the world's biggest CO2 emitter, producing almost twice as much as China,and at a per capita 10 times greater.            (A thought: Maybe there's a solution here to the cloud of graft andcorruption hanging over Washington: scandal credits.)
