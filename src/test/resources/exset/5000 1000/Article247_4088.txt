                                 Brainless in Seattle            Everybody leads with yesterday's Seattle street clashes between protestersand police that delayed the opening of the WTO summit and resulted in anall-night curfew and the calling out of some unarmed National Guard units tokeep the peace for President Clinton's arrival early Wednesday morning. Thefronts all feature photos of the cops firing tear gas and pepper spray onprotesters, reminding the reader of the authorities' central PR problem in suchsituations: Regardless of the merits, there's no way to look good when you'rearmored from head to toe and shooting stuff at folks who are unarmored andunarmed.            The coverage explains that what the Washington Post calls a "guerrilla army of anti-tradeprotesters" (anti-trade?) started massing early in the day, prompting thelock-down of the main hotels in downtown Seattle housing WTO delegates and ofthe convention center where the meetings were supposed to be held. Stores andrestaurants then shut down and then protesters filled the streets. The paperssay that most of the protest was nonviolent noncompliance, but also pass alongeyewitness accounts of destruction of property, including that Seattlesacrilege, the looting and vandalizing of a Starbucks. ( USA Todayshows a moronic dirtball doing just that.) It's reported that much of theviolence was committed by people in black clothes and ski masks.            The papers grapple with the sheer diversity of the protesters: peopledressed as pigs, turtles, clowns, Superman, vegetables, fish, and butterflies,says the WP . The Los Angeles Times spots Earth First! members chainingthemselves together and women calling themselves "Vegan Dykes" marchingtopless. Also present were some top leaders of U.S. labor, a Sierra Clubhoncho, and a leading Chinese dissident. The only common thread seemed to be,as the New York Times puts it, the viewthat the WTO is a "handmaiden of corporate interests whose rulings underminehealth, labor and environmental protections around the world." FrancisFukuyama, in the Wall Street Journal , and Thomas Friedman, in theNYT , have columns today ridiculing this view.            The WTO protests are undoubtedly an important, perhaps even watershed,event, but the LAT overshoots when it states: "Not since the days of theVietnam War and the civil rights movement has the entire downtown core of amajor American city been seized by a popular political uprising." Well, no ...actually there was this thing called the L.A. riots. Remember,LAT ?--your building got trashed.            The LAT fronts and the NYT and USAT go inside with newresearch uncovering brain damage in Gulf War veterans complaining of the myriadsymptoms collectively known as "Gulf War Syndrome." The finding means,according to a lead researcher quoted in the LAT , that the vets'complaints are not the result of battlefield stress, the conclusion of apresidential advisory panel two years ago.            An AP dispatch in the "Findings" section of the WP says secondhandcigarette smoke may be more dangerous than previously believed: A new studyfound that a group of Missouri women with a certain genetic mutation who livewith smokers were 2.6 to six times more likely to develop lung cancer. Anotherpiece of research--based on 366,000 people (!)--in "Findings" is that notsmoking and watching your cholesterol and blood pressure is worth six to 10extra years of life.            The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. auto businesswill this year break a total vehicle sales record that's stood for 13 years.And the paper says some auto industry types think the new car market hasbroadened permanently. Reasons? The enormous wealth caused by the boom meansmore three-car garages. The intersection of rising median income and flat orfalling new car prices hasn't been this favorable since 1980. And baby boomersare entering their 50s, which are the peak car-buying years.            The WP profiles a Maryland man who took a problem where helives--dead deer on the highway--and turned it into a solution to a problemeverywhere--poor people not having enough to eat. His idea: pick up the roadkill and turn it into venison for the hungry. The paper reports that in thepast five years, the project has produced more than 100,000 pounds of meat forthe poor. The man's business card reads "You Whack 'Em, I Pack 'Em." Now, if hecould only make a sauce from spent pepper spray shells ...
