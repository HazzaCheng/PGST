                                 Petroleum Jelling            The Washington Post and New York Timeslead with the decision by a coalition of some of the world's top oil exportersto cut back production in an attempt to reverse a sharp price slide. USA Today ,which runs the oil story as its off-lead, leads with the revelation that lastfall, the State Department shut down some of its worldwide computer systemsbecause of a suspected penetration by hackers. The systems contain unclassifiedbut sensitive information such as the travel schedules of U.S. embassyofficials. The Los Angeles Times goes with the first joint appearance ofthe leading Democratic gubernatorial candidates at a state partyconvention.            The oil news is that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico, which togethersupply about a fifth of the world's oil, issued a joint statement saying thatthey and other oil producers plan a cutback amounting to about 2.7 percent ofworld production. The move, which the WP calls "unusual solidarity," isexpected to send oil prices up. The NYT reports that the initialreaction in the Asian markets on Monday was nearly a $4 up-tick.            The Times explains that having non-OPEC countries like Mexico onboard is important because in the past OPEC production cuts have often been metwith non-OPEC production surges. The paper also notes that many analysts hadbeen predicting the economic pain of low oil revenues would force the producersto rein in production. Clear enough, but then the paper goes on to "illustrate"that idea with the following passage from the joint statement, which isanything but: ".[A] drop in oil prices could lead to a reduction in theinvestments needed to secure international supplies, which would destabilizethe world economy in the medium term."            OSCAR NOTE I: The LAT says that "The Full Monty," made for a paltry$3.5 million, could ultimately turn a profit of around $100 million. TheWall Street Journal says the movie has already rakedin more than $200 million.            OSCAR NOTE II: This past Saturday's NYT reported that acting is onthe rise as an occupational choice for young people, and today's USAT"Snapshot" reports that in a recent poll, 51 percent of men surveyed wouldprefer their children grew up to be a Hollywood star rather than a U.S.Senator. (Only 32 percent of the women preferred this.)            Curiously, the LAT lead puts in the second paragraph the informationthat businessman Al Checchi criticized Rep. Jane Harman for appealing toRepublicans, that Harman sniped at Checchi for having a lot of position papers,and that Lt. Gov. Gray Davis attacked them both as millionaires trying to buythe election, but delays until the fifth paragraph the news that Checchi andHarman said that as governor they would seek to repeal Prop. 209, theCalifornia ballot measure outlawing racial and gender preferences in statehiring and college admissions, and that Davis would not do this. Plus, thereader has to wait to the sixth paragraph to learn that Davis also wouldn'tcommit to signing a bill sanctioning gay marriage, while both Checchi andHarman would do that.            The WP runs a piece inside reporting that according to Russiansources, Russian intelligence agents have, for the past several years, quietlyrecruited scientists to go to Iran and teach their Iranian counterparts how tobuild missiles to carry deadly payloads as far as 1,200 miles. The piece goeson to say that the Russians intend to stop this practice. Some observers,remarks the Post , wonder if the Russian government can in fact stop theflow of scientists to Tehran.            The WSJ brings evidence that not every conservative blindly supportsthe many turns of Ken Starr's investigation of President Clinton. The "Rule ofLaw" piece, by a former Reagan administration deputy attorney general, arguesthat "it is time for a sober reassessment of the power we have concentrated inthe hands of prosecutors and the alarming absence of effective checks andbalances to prevent the widespread abuse of that power."            The two people in America who still think of the NYT as America'ssober "paper of record," are directed to Sunday's front section, page 20.There, instead of the dozens of straightforward shots of Robert Bennett nodoubt available, the paper opts for a shot of him with a crazed smile and handsnot quite in front his face, making him look like a spastic Mafia don.            The WP reports on last Saturday night's Gridiron Dinner, that annualWashington D.C. court masque in which bigfoot journalists entertain thegovernment's heaviest hitters and vice-versa. The centerpiece this year wasPresident Clinton's monologue, which featured the following joke he said hadbeen approved by his lawyers: "Knock-knock" "Don't answer that."
