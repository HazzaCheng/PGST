                                 Bush Beats Clinton                           USAToday leads with the Clinton administration's stern words to Iraq. Boththe LosAngeles Times and the New York Timesgo with President Clinton's last-ditch attempt to generate support for thefast-track trade authority bill. The Washington Post leads with the Democrats' attempt tosalvage the nomination of Bill Lann Lee for Justice's top civil rightsenforcement job.                           USAT reports that the administration warned Iraq on Thursday that itcould face military action or economic sanctions if it continues to keep U.N.inspection teams out of its facilities. Secretary of Defense William Cohen isquoted as saying "sufficient warnings have been given." And the paper reportsthat an American aircraft carrier canceled a port call so as to be able to staywithin striking range of Iraq.            The NYT describes Clinton's Thursday night television appeal forsupport of the trade bill as "extraordinary." The paper reports that the votecount was looking so unfavorable that the president cut short his trip to theopening of the Bush presidential library in Texas--where he got a ringingendorsement for the bill from George Bush--so he could return to work thephones to lobby members of Congress. The LAT says the bill is hanging"by a thread" on the eve of the House vote.            According to the WP , the Clinton administration is also staring atdefeat with the Lee nomination. Lee has, says the paper, faced no seriousquestions about his credentials, but in the past week has become a lighteningrod for congressional Republicans and conservative activists, who have taken toportraying him as an unabashed advocate for race preferences            The WP runs a front-page zinger detailing all the free travelcongress members and their spouses have been copping lately. These pieces havelong been a newspaper staple, but the news is that, in the Post 's words,"In an era when congressional gift rules have all but eliminated the freelunch, the free round of golf and the free night on the town, congressionaltravel is the last great perk."            It seems there's blowback from yesterday's NYT story stating thatmost direct-mail retailers were about to collect sales tax. The Wall Street Journal reports that resistance to the idea onthe part of some vendors is so strong that any such agreement will be put offat least until December, not announced today as the Times had reported.Today's NYT says the deal fell apart because of widespread customercomplaints prompted by its story, and that L.L. Bean is among thedefectors.            That Bush library opening was the occasion for four presidents, six firstladies, and Wayne Newton to get together. The photo op gave the LAT , theWP , and the NYT good shots for their fronts. The weirdest ofthese being the NYT picture, which takes the warm fraternal fuzzies nowfelt by Clinton and Bush to a new level of intimacy by depicting them aspower-suited Siamese twins. The NYT piece on the day keeps it light, butthe WP story keeps hitting current geopolitics, mentioning that as theceremonies were unfolding, "Saddam Hussein was again thumbing his nose at theUnited States," and quoting Clinton's reference from the podium to "thevigilance President Bush displayed in dealing with Iraq, [which] as we allknow, is required again today." The piece also mentions that Bush has endorsedClinton's stance on the current Iraq imbroglio.            The Post mentions a letter of Lincolnesque proportions displayed atthe library that Bush wrote to his children during the run-up to Desert Storm."When the question is asked, `How many lives are you willing to sacrifice'--ittears my heart," Bush wrote. "The answer, of course, is none--none at all." Headded, "Every human life is precious, the little Iraqi kids' too." If Bush hadbeen able to put himself across like that in public, Clinton might never havebecome president.            Very few journalists these days have been in the military, so they have aconsistent tendency to boot matters martial, and the NYT story on thelibrary opening provides an example. The Times refers to the exhibit of"a World War II Avenger fighter plane" like the one Bush was shot down in. Butit's not a fighter. It's a torpedo bomber.
