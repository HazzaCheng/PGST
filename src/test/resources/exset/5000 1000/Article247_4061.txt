                                 Who Stole Nissan's <I>Cojones</I>?            Nissan Motor Corporation, which recently announced a six-month loss of $3billion, has been trying to pull itself out of near-bankruptcy with TV adsfeaturing its handsome, smooth-talking design chief, Jerry Hirshberg. In a spotfor the Nissan Altima that's on the air now, Hirshberg boasts, "Technicallyspeaking, we gave the car some cojones ." The word "cojones " ispartially bleeped out to emphasize that Hirshberg is bravely violating a taboo.Fleeting images of Altimas go by. Edgy!Here's the problem with this ad: Over the last few years, Nissan has managedthe difficult feat of going broke while making some of the best mass-marketcars in the world. About a decade ago, if I remember right, Nissan made theleading vehicle, in terms of quality and performance, in practically everycategory: The Sentra was the best small car, the Maxima the best sedan, thePathfinder the best SUV. Then, although Nissan's quality stayed high, sales andprofits somehow plummeted. How did they do it? One word: ugly .*Since Hirshberg's shop produced many of those loser designs, it's odd that heeven kept his job, much less wound up as Nissan's public face. It's as if theleading Democratic candidate for president hired the architect of theDemocrats' 1994 congressional defeat to run his campaign! OK, bad example. Butyou get the point.Hirshberg has managed to dodge blame for Nissan's decline by letting it beshifted to his Japanese bosses. The Detroit News recently reported that"in the old days, product plans and designs would go from California to Japanand return watered down, Hirshberg said." That may have been true for somemodels. But for others, Hirshberg can't deny paternity. In his own book, TheCreative Priority , Hirshberg boasts of producing the original InfinitiJ30, a car whose massively round, sagging rear end (based, Hirshberg says,on the bottom of a toilet bowl) was like nothing on the road, and nothing manyconsumers wanted to buy. The J30 was a car desperately trying to make apretentious fashion statement, but it galumphed awkwardly in the real world oftires and asphalt. As P.J. O'Rourke once said of a Honda Prelude: It looks goodfrom the front, it looks good from the back, it looks good from the top and thesides. It just doesn't look good.Hirshberg also claims paternity for the original Altima, another radical, droopy-assed design thatperformed weakly in the marketplace. "Every time I see somebody driving one ofthose," says a friend of mine, "I feel sorry for them." The currentAltima retains the original's basic downcast shape--which is why thoseimages in the current TV ad are so fleeting. This is a vehicle designed toinstantly lower your serotonin level by 50 percent.** The reason Hirshberg nowhas to add "cojones " is that he cut them off in the first place.P.S.: Hirshberg was recently hired to help redesign the Los AngelesTimes. How will he (to quote his book) "break through the stereotypes andfreely access the associations and imagery ... needed for inspiration"? Whenhis team designed the ill-fated J30, they thought about toilet bowls andconceived their target customer as "the perfect asshole!" Times readersmay be in for a special treat.P.P.S.: In fairness, Hirshberg's shop did produce at least one brilliantdesign, the 1990 "Gobi" pickup truck, which married a helicopter-pod cabin to asimple corrugated-steel truck bin. On the other hand, his recent proposedrevival of the "Z" sports car was a shapeless blob.                           * Nissan also failed to anticipate consumer demand for airbags; foryears, many of its best cars were available only with those annoying motorizedseat belts.               ** I don't want to speculate on the psychosexual meaning of "high-butt"versus "low-butt" automobiles, except to note that a) it's pretty darn obvious;b) in keeping with a), men seem to uniformly like the high-rear designs, whilethose who like the low-rear look tend to be women; c) the low-rear look hasabjectly failed in the market--the Altima, the J30, and the disastrous 1996redesign of the Ford Taurus being the three most obvious flops. Ford has nowreissued the Taurus with a higher butt, and Nissan probably can't wait to redothe sad-sack Altima. The high-rear form is also functional, improving bothaerodynamics and luggage space. The final collapse of the low-rear school wasprobably signaled recently when Audi was forced to add a spoiler--a raisedwing--to the round, drooping rear of its high-style TT Coupe. Without the wing,the car tended to become unstable at very high speeds.
