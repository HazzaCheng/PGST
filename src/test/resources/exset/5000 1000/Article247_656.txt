                                 Shuttered to Think                           USAToday and the New YorkTimes lead with the U.S. decision, in the wake of the African embassybombings, to shut some embassies in order to update their security. TheWashington Post goes with word that Kenneth Starr'supcoming report to Congress will focus on evidence of possible impeachable actsrelating to President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and will noteven include the Arkansas financial dealings that Starr has been investigatingfor four years. The WP front ignores embassy security, and theUSAT and Times fronts ignore Starr.                           USAT and the NYT report that the State Dept. says it has received more than a dozen threats toembassies since the African bombings, but that State is emphasizingembassies are not being closed permanently. Indeed, the NYT suggests thedowntime might be just a matter of days. USAT quotes the AP'sidentification of three of the affected sites: the embassies in Uganda,Malaysia and Swaziland. The Times also names Uganda and Malaysia, butrefers only to a several-hours evacuation at the Swaziland embassy in responseto a bomb threat. The paper adds that the embassy in the Ivory Coast is cuttingback its business hours while security is improved, and that the Cairo officesof the U.S. Agency for International Development were closed and its employeesmoved into the city's U.S. embassy.            This space often notes how USAT headlines cut to the chase, but itsheadline over this story--"U.S. To Shut Embassies To Fix Security"--cuts toomuch, with its suggestion that all embassies are being affected. Better is theNYT header: "U.S. Closes Down Some Operations in Foreign Posts."            The WP 's account of the Starr report to Congress notes that he will eventuallyproduce a separate and more inclusive document for the judicial panel thatappointed him. In the meantime though, the paper explains, the pared-downLewinsky report will get to Congress quickly (probably shortly after PresidentClinton testifies to the Starr grand jury)--in plenty of time to leak out andproduce much partisan acrimony during the fall elections.            The NYT and USAT top fronts feature stories about yesterday'scourt proceeding in Arkansas in which a twelve-year-old and a fourteen-year-oldwere given the strictest sentence available to juveniles, for shooting to deathfour students and a teacher: confinement in a juvenile detention center untilage 18. One of the boys made no formal statement in court, while the otherapologized but also said he meant to shoot over everybody's head.            The Times notes that in Arkansas, juvenile proceedings are usuallyclosed to the public and press, but that the judge in this case had allowed amore open hearing. And the nation's newspaper editors seem to have likewiseloosened up on juvenile coverage in this case--the papers run the boys' names,and indeed, the fronts of the NYT , WP , and USAT allfeature pictures of them. Just what are the papers' policies in this area? It'shard to figure out from what they publish--just yesterday the papers told thetale of two boys, age 7 and 8, arrested for murdering an 11-year-old girl,without publishing their pictures or their names.            The WP reports that the three-year old Korean War Memorial, built inWashington, D.C. by the Army Corps of Engineers, needs $2 million to fixbuckled paving stones, 40 dead shade trees, and a leaking Pool of Remembrance.Shouldn't a war memorial be built to last longer than the war it's a memorialto?            The Wall Street Journal runs a front-page feature describinga new type of medical consultant service: for about $800 ayear, you get access to a doctor who, when you get sick, advises you how tobest navigate the health care bureaucracy. The paper says such a developmentpoints the way to a multitiered medical system where the quality of medicalcare might depend even more than it does today on a patient's wealth.            The WP reports that last week's signing into law by President Clintonof a comprehensive job training bill "got lost in the backdraft of the MonicaLewinsky investigation." The paper adds that "little seems to be getting donein the capital these days and when it does it barely causes a ripple." Thestory runs on page six.
