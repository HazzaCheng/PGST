                                 What is Puerto Rico?                        Last week, President Clinton freed 12 jailed members ofFALN, a group that fought for Puerto Rican independence (sometimes with bombs)from the United States. What, exactly, is Puerto Rico's relationship to theU.S.? And what alternatives have been proposed?            The U.S. took possession of Puerto Rico in 1898 as partof its spoils from the Spanish-American War. Congress governed the Caribbeanisland directly as a territory until 1952, when it expanded Puerto Ricanautonomy by making it a "commonwealth," allowing it to adopt a constitution andcreate a locally elected government with statelike powers. (Click here for a map of Puerto Rico.)            As a commonwealth , PuertoRico is subject to all federal laws, and the U.S. Congress reserves the rightto repeal any locally enacted legislation. Congress granted Puerto Ricansstatutory U.S. citizenship in 1917, which can berevoked, as opposed to constitutional citizenship,which is almost impossible to cancel. Puerto Ricans residing in Puerto Ricocannot vote for president, and the delegate they elect to Congress has no vote.Puerto Rico residents are also exempt from federal income tax but qualify forfederal entitlements. And all 18-year-old Puerto Rican males must register forthe draft, just like U.S. residents.            Puerto Ricans are free to move to the U.S. where theirrights of citizenship become constitutional, affording them the right to votein all elections. Currently, 2 million Puerto Ricans live in the United Statesand 4 million live in Puerto Rico.            Commonwealth was designed as a temporary fix, butperiodic plebiscites have not resolved what relationship the island's residentswant with the U.S. In 1993 and 1998, support was evenly divided betweencommonwealth status and pursuit of statehood. In both plebiscites, independencegot less than 5 percent of the vote. Washington is not likely to formalizePuerto Rico's status until a clearer consensus emerges.            Puerto Rico has benefited economically from being acommonwealth. After World War II, America poured millions of dollars intoPuerto Rican development, transforming it from one of the Caribbean's poorestterritories to one of the wealthiest. The island still receives $10 billion inassistance (including entitlements) each year. American companies investing inPuerto Rico have long been exempted from income tax, making the island amanufacturing and pharmaceutical center. Congress has begun to phase out thetax exemption, reducing the attractiveness of investment there. If PuertoRico's commonwealth status becomes more permanent, advocates say thatcitizenship and economic assistance will, as well. But there is some debate asto whether such guarantees are constitutionally possible.                           Statehood advocates desirethe benefits of constitutional citizenship, the federal safety net, and theeconomic stability that will likely follow. Puerto Rican critics of statehoodoppose the island's continued dependence on the U.S. and worry that it mighteliminate Puerto Rico's Latin culture. (Indeed, some members of Congress haveproposed adoption of English as the official language as a prerequisite forstatehood.) American critics oppose statehood on fiscal grounds. As a state,Puerto Rico's per capita income would be half that of Mississippi, currentlythe poorest state. In 1995, the General Accounting Office estimated statehoodwould cost the U.S. Treasury another $3 billion in annual benefits.            Supporters of Puerto Rican independence advocate continued ties to the U.S., including a freetrade pact, a common currency, and joint citizenship. Some also suggest thatthe U.S. would continue to be responsible for the country's defense. Butindependence critics dismiss it as unworkable, saying Puerto Rico lacks theinfrastructure and natural resources to compete effectively.            Next question?
