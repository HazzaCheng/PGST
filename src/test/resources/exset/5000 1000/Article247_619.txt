                                 Teachers' Pet Peeves                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with the rejection of a proposedmerger of the nation's two main teachers' unions by the membership of one ofthem, the National Education Association (and this is the off-lead at theNew York Timesand is above the fold at the Los Angeles Times ). The NYT leads with theretreat of the nation's biggest HMOs from managed care programs for the poorand the elderly. The LAT goes with the launch in Yugoslavia's troubledKosovo province of patrols jointly conducted by U.S., British, and Russiandiplomatic observers. The patrols, explains the paper, were first proposed bythe Russians but have since been embraced by the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,who stresses that the two countries are now working together to defuse theKosovo crisis.            Both USAT and the WP explain that had the NEA merged with theAmerican Federation of Teachers, this would have created the U.S.' largestlabor union. The WP says that the no vote came even though the leaders of both unions favoredthe move. The merger idea, says the Post , had gained strength recentlyin response to increased attempts to limit teacher rights and to give studentspublicly funded vouchers to attend private schools. But, both papers say, thestumbling block appears to be a fear among NEA members of becoming affiliatedwith the AFL-CIO, of which the AFT is a member. The WP mentions an NEAfear of being aligned too closely with the causes and politics of the AFL-CIOwithout specifying what these are. The paper does explain that the NEA tends toview itself as more non-partisan and more like a professional organization(like the AMA) than a trade union. USAT says that according to the NEA,the rivalry between the unions cost $100 million between 1973 and 1992.            According to the NYT , general operating losses and cuts in governmentpayments have prompted the country's biggest HMOs--such names as Pacificare,Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross and Blue Shield--to quit Medicare and Medicaid coverage in many different markets.The retreat from Medicaid--government-subsidized care for the poor anddisabled--is the more pronounced of the two. Most of the Medicaid withdrawals,says the Times , have come in the most populous states with large pocketsof urban poverty. With Medicare, it's tended to be rural communities with fewpatients, clinics, or doctors. The HMO flight portends, says the Times ,a return to skimping care for the poor and elderly.            The Wall Street Journal reports that the semiconductorbusiness--seriously affected by the Asian crisis, a production glut and theadvent of the $1,000 PC--is in a global slump, and that American manufacturersare certainly taking their share of the hits. U.S. chip companies that havelaid off workers or tipped upcoming bad earnings include, says the paper,National Semiconductor, Atmel, Cypress Semiconductor and Seeq Technology. EvenIntel has projected a flat second quarter and lower profit margins.            The WP passes along word from a weekend chat show that Kenneth Starrhas decided he will not submit an interim report on his investigation ofPresident Clinton before Congress recesses for the fall election campaigns. Hewill, said an aide, submit a report only if he determines there is substantialinformation that crimes have been committed. The aide also opined, reports thePost , that subpoenaing a sitting president is legally unproblematic, asis indicting one.            In its editorial advocating that the DOJ and FBI abandon theircurrent policy against the use of computer encryption technology the feds arenot at least indirectly privy to, the NYT explains President Clinton'sfailure to oppose this law enforcement stance thusly: "[S]ince Attorney GeneralJanet Reno has protected Mr. Clinton from an independent counsel on campaignfinance, the White House is said to be loath to oppose either her or LouisFreeh, the F.B.I. Director, on this issue." But the reader isn't told who saysthis. A recurring theme of the many media post-mortems on the Time/CNN/nervegas and Stephen Glass debacles--including of those issued by theNYT --has been a fervent tsk-tsking directed at unnamed sources. Soshouldn't this apply to the editorial pages too?
