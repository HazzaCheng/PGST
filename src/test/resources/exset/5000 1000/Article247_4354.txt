                                 Disorganized Crime                        Dear Jeff,            OK, you fuckin' mook. I deserved exactly half of that butt-kicking. But onlyhalf. So watch it. The first rule of mob movies is, never give someone a biggerbeating than they deserve in the first act if you don't want to get your assthrashed in the third.            You're right about the writing being better than the acting, but onlybecause the writing is so good. You're right aboutGoodfellas --"laugh-fest" was too strong. Scorsese is not a belly-laughkinda guy. You're right about expectations having been blown out of proportion.And you are so right that David Chase should have killed off LiviaSoprano, whose acid tongue is starting to remind me of the monster drool in theAlien movies--it eats away at the infrastructure.            I'll get back to Livia in a minute, but first I have to get up on myCulturebox and pontificate on where you're wrong. You are wrong, sir, to saythat television criticism is about profound meaning. Most of it is criticstrying to explain how they think things work, and why they like them. Theaudience has a right to figure stuff out, and to read people who might helpthem do that. The boob tube is powerful. Millions of people watch this show andtalk about it every week. Mobsters in fact do take their cues from it, at leastaccording to Time and Newsweek this week. The Sopranoswill probably do more than any of Tipper Gore's mental-health initiatives toget insurance companies to change their policy on psychotherapy reimbursements.So don't shut down the entire discussion just because you've started hangingout with the producer and presumably swallowed his artsy-fartsy,faux -modest, we're-just-making-TV-here crap.            Now, back to the second season. Cards on the table: I think next Sunday'sepisode is a letdown, although that was probably inevitable. It's anadvertisement for psychotherapy, only this time in reverse. Without Melfi, thepsychiatrist, around to draw out Tony's human side, he and his buddies justseem angry and sour. Thugs are thugs and their wives are idiots to stick aroundand mob business is greasy and seedy, instead of greasy and seedy andfun . There was a sweetness to Tony when he was discovering his innermensch that made his and everyone else's brutality come off as ironicand incongruous, rather than just brutal.            Now stroke-victim Livia is a stringy-haired vision of evil, instead of anamusingly tart-tongued old bitch. Her daughter and Tony's sister, a sleazyex-hippie named Pavarti, nee Janice, has shown up from Seattle, ostensibly totake care of her mother but more likely to scam off her brother. Christopher,Tony's protg, has a new gig as an SEC compliance officer involving somecomplicated scheme to dump crummy stock on unsuspecting widows and shut-ins,but basically he's the same asshole junkie he always was, and has taken tofighting in bars with Ariana, his girlfriend. Carmela is more long-sufferingthan ever. She is reduced in this episode to smiling sadly a lot and cookingziti. Melfi sees patients in a roadside motel, and when Tony finally tracks herdown in a diner, she spits in his face: "Fuck you!"            And Tony, my god. He has turned into a huge drag, stomping around, crashinghis SUV, and throwing hissy fits at the world. The only really great moment inthe entire hour is the look on his face when the male shrink he goes to indesperation says he can't take on a patient in Tony's line of work. After all,quoth the shrink, "I saw Analyze This !" "Analyze This ?" saysTony, with that inimitable Gandolfini I-can't-believe-I'm-hearing-this-shitdouble take. "It's a fuckin' comedy !"            Oh yeah. Analyze This. Do we have to? What's there to say?            Are mob movies played out? Who knows? As Melfi's son said last season,they're our national epic, or something like that. But one thing's for sure:They're all going to have to refer to The Sopranos now, the way TheSopranos has to refer to The Godfather.                        I want to know what happens next with the mob--in real life--if, as you say,the smarter ones realize that the Bada-Bing lifestyle is dead.            And, um, Jeffrey? Little Herring ? What the hell kind of moniker isthat?            Yours most critically,Judith "De Man" Shulevitz
