Your Intdis Index is an accountingsystem; it has nothing to do with the scientific method. The scientific methodis about hypothesis testing and experimentation. Simply giving things numericalvalues is not science.            I can understand yourwanting to shame the Wall Street Journal with some semblance ofmathematical rigor, but Lord knows we poor scientists have to defend ourselvesagainst enough nonsense posing as science ("Mister Chairman, how can that 10year study show us anything about bears when my cousin told me he never saw abear in his life?").                           --Kate Wing                        Washington                           Personal NonGrata                        "" wonders if theprincipal investigator for the research project on the effect of women's workon young children and the journalist who reported the story in the Washington Post , themselves, haveyoung children and worked outside the home. But the Los Angeles Timeslead story was about another research finding (air pollution in SouthernCalifornia), and we did not learn whether the researchers and journalistsinvolved live in L.A. Newspapers continually report on cancer research or heartdisease without telling us if the reporters ever had those diseases, or if theyor any member of their immediate family is an albino lab rat, and so on.                           --John Haaga            Bethesda, Md.

If Tinky Winky (see "")has no explicit gender, how do you know that the handbag, tutu, and so onaren't veiled signals that Tinky is female?            -- Pete Wright                                       Akron, Ohio                                       Jacob Weisbergreplies: I didn't say the Teletubbies have no gender, because they do. Two areostensibly male (Tinky Winky and Dipsy), and two are ostensibly female (Laa Laaand Po). I said they have no intended sexual orientation.

But Jacob Weisberg's "" seems to be offered up as genuine criticalinsight rather than as the "cocktail chatter" it is. Like all dichotomies,Apollonian vs. Dionysian is limited as a means of ordering the world. It's likeputting a filter over a camera lens: Some colors are heightened, but others arecompletely obscured, and the final result may bear no resemblance to reality.Labeling Matisse a "cool, calm, Northern European" and Picasso as a "hot,temperamental Spaniard" is that kind of distortion (not to mention ethnicstereotyping of the most trivial and annoying sort). Do Picasso's "blue period"paintings really strike one as "hot" and "temperamental"?            Do the terms apply to a work's form or its content?I was especially amused by the Dickinson/Whitman dichotomy. Dickinson's poetryis simply too weird, and yes, sexual (talk about images of "ecstatic release"),to fit comfortably into a category whose hallmarks are deemed to be "measure,reason, and control." Yes, you can sing just about every one of Dickinson'spoems to the tune of "I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing" (try it, it's fun),but that kind of surface-level orderliness is undermined by the speaker'sdisconcerting propensity to topple into the abyss, whether prompted by unionwith God, union with the beloved, or union with death. If a work is "about""abandon, irrationality, and ecstatic release," but its execution displays"measure, reason, and control" --one might place any number of baroque operasin this category, for instance, or Nathaniel Hawthorne, for that matter.            Equally annoying is theassertion that we are all either Matisse or Picasso people, or Stones orBeatles people. Many of my older acquaintances have little tolerance forany of them, while I would never be able to make a "desert island"choice between them--really. Besides, "Sympathy for the Devil" only seemsdarker and more subterranean than "Girl."                           --Kathleen R.O'Connell                        New York City
