                                 "Kyle's Mom Is a Bitch": An Exegesis                        Good morning, all:            Roger: Doubtless Elvis will be responding to you about Michael Clarke Duncanin The Green Mile , but I've got to say I flinched when I read that "hisfunction is essentially to absorb and process white pain, suffering, diseaseand guilt, which he does visibly--which is a novel change from the decades offilms in which black characters have done the same thing invisibly." That'sexactly what drives some of us crazy about that character--that he has noautonomous existence, that he's there solely to help "process" white pain.Poitier might have humanized Steiger, but Mr. Tibbs is nominally flesh andblood, a man with a full range of emotions. John Coffey is another of StephenKing's mystical black martyrs with extra-sensory perception. In the scene inwhich he heals Patricia Clarkson, he hovers over her bedridden form in a waythat's meant to summon up rape fantasies of fragile white Southern flowersmenaced by darkies--and to miraculously invert them. But to me a miraculousinversion of a rape fantasy is almost as cheap and false as the thingitself--the black saint as much of an unhealthy projection as the blackdemon.            Before I drop the film-vs.-video, reverie-vs.-hypnosis issue, let me saythat a) I'm salivating over your home theater setup and b) I'm slightly wary ofanecdotal evidence. Your fears about the medium might be warranted (and let'sfind out before all those theaters get converted!), but the tendency to tranceout in front of a boob tube (even a mega-mega-boob tube) has a lot to do withthe setting and the quality of your attention. You can stretch out, glancearound the room, go to the toilet, read a newspaper--and even if you don't, youknow you have the option. I've had most of my really intense aestheticexperiences at live theater (and a few at the opera), and I've always figuredthat's because I'd been forced to make more of an investment in what I waswatching--to commit to it in a way I don't when I watch TV.            I want to apologize, Roger, if I gave the impression yesterday that JoelSiegal and John Simon were making fun of Magnolia at a showing of thatfilm. They were each discussing it--not discreetly but not "publicly"--at ascreening for critics of The Talented Mr. Ripley , and I'm certain thatthey didn't think some smartass like me would report the gist of theirconversations to the world. (I gather, however, that Joel Siegal has lambastedthe picture on an upcoming program of yours. And John Simon has never beenashamed to have his opinions widely broadcast.) I suppose I invoked thembecause they represent such wildly divergent sensibilities--one populist, theother defiantly highbrow--and both were united in a kind of ebullient loathingof this poor picture. I'm glad you're putting Magnolia on your 10-bestlist, because it needs champions; it seems to me so poignantly vulnerable toridicule.            Sarah: In your final post yesterday you asked: "Can it really be thatdifficult to write a song called 'Kyle's Mom Is a Bitch?' I bet any number ofpeople reading this exchange could do as well or better."            I don't wish to discourage anyone from doing as well or better--my mailboxis open (as, I'm sure, is yours, Sarah). But I'd like to speak up for thatnumber, which is emblematic of many of South Park 's strengths. "Kyle'sMom Is a Bitch" is an infantile playground chant raised to the level of comicart by a) Cartman's speed-freak/squalling-baby vocal, b) the sophisticatedBroadway-style orchestration, and c) the happy notion that people in othercultures (the Netherlands, Holland, China, Africa) would come out in fullnational regalia to sing about Kyle's mom being a bitch. In form, it's ashowbizzy patter song, but because of its lightning tempo (which makes thewords barely intelligible) and the steady repetition of "bitch" on thedownbeat, it has the primal force of an incantation:                           Kyle'sMomisaBITCHshe'sabigfatBITCHshe'sthebiggestBITCHinthewholewideworld ...OnMondayshe'saBITCHonTuesdaysshe'saBITCH ...                        OK, it's not Noel Coward, but it makes me as blissful as anything has sinceI was toilet-trained.            Yours,David
