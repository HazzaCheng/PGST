                                 Greenhousekeeping Seal of Approval            The approval in Kyoto of a global warming control plan leads all around. Thedailies note that it puts the first-ever mandatory limits on greenhouse gaseslike carbon dioxide, assigning various countries different output reductions tobe implemented from 2008 to 2012. The U.S. would be required to cut emissionsto 7 percent below 1990 levels. USA Today says developing countries are exempt fromthe emissions cuts and that delegates agreed to a U.S.-backed emissions tradingsystem for industrialized nations but will spend a year deciding how it willwork.            The coverage is confusing, since, for example, the Washington Post says the meetings simply tabled until nextyear the issue of whether and how the world's poorer nations would participate,and the New York Timessays the industrial nations are required to reduce their emissions of the sixmain greenhouse gases to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels, while the Los AngelesTimes says they're bound to a 6.5 percent reduction. (But theLAT headline says 6 percent. No small matter--that half a percentrepresents a lot of pollution.)            The reporters' work was no doubt made difficult by the same rigors faced bydelegates, who kept working even though the interpreters went home and, saysthe WP , the dining hall was down to just a few bananas.            The papers convey the overall impression that environmental groups arefairly pleased by the Kyoto protocol and that industry groups hate it."This agreement represents unilateral economic disarmament," one lobbyist tells the WP . And all the papers agreethat the plan's prospects in the Senate, which must ratify it for the U.S. tobecome bound to it, are at best iffy. Indeed, the WP runs a separate piece about this under the headline: "Senate GOPDeclares Kyoto Pact Dead."            The LAT says Kyoto will alter the way "global residents" do things.Question: are there any other kinds of residents? But give the LATcredit for making the most straightforward observation about why some reform isnecessary: "...1997 has been the warmest year on record." Some of the Kyotoheadlines, like USAT's "Global Warming Pact OK'd," overstate a bit, since it'sa plan, not a deal. The NYT hits the nail a little more squarely: "TentativeAccord is Reached to Cut Greenhouse Gases."            Both the LAT and WP report that the scientific journalNature reveals today that scientists have achieved a primitive form ofteleportation, by replicating the exact properties of a light particle intoanother one three feet away. After reading the Kyoto pieces, it was surprisingnot to find an outraged quote or two here from airline lobbyists.            Lingering question from l'affaire Lawrence for assignment editors: Why notdo a story about how Lawrence came to seize upon the Bushnell sinking as thefabric for his fiction?            No White House story these days is complete without a quote from DickMorris, who rarely misses a chance to bite the hand that no longer feeds him.Today's example comes in USAT 's story about the new presidential dog. Morrisweighs in with: "I think the phenomenon of unconditional loyalty is probablysomething that he could use as president..But if I were the dog, I would watchmy back, because I'm not sure the quality of unconditional love is alwaysreciprocated."            The NYT reports that prior to setting out for the South Bronxyesterday, President Clinton spent the night in "a" $6,500-night presidentialsuite at the Waldorf-Astoria. (Question: do they really have more than onepresidential suite? If so, why?) After touring the Bronx, the WP reportshe went shopping, buying among other things, $400 in jewelry and some sweatersand briefcases. When the owner of one store said he couldn't charge thepresident, Clinton produced his credit card, saying, "Yes, you can." Question:Does that mean we also get to charge him for that Waldorf room?
