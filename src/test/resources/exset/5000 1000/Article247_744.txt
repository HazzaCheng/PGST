                                 Newtered            Election postmortems lead all around. In the aftermath of the first midtermelection since 1934 in which the president's party gained House seats, theheadlines stress Republican disarray. The Los AngelesTimes top says the Republican party "Takes Stock of Losses." USA Today 'sheader says a "GOP Shake-Up is Possible"--right next to a big picture of abefuddled-looking Newt juxtaposed with the caption, "Will Gingrich Survive?"The New York Timesbig type says, "GOP in Scramble Over Blame," and the Washington Post sums things up similarly: "ShakenRepublicans Count Losses, Debate Blame." (Question to the WP 's photoeditor: Was it really necessary at this very satisfying moment for BillClinton, to run a picture of him that suggests he's having cramps? Didn't hesmile at least once yesterday?)            According to the papers, the single biggest lesson learned from Tuesday'svote is, in the words of the Wall Street Journal front-page wash-up, "Impeachment isn'ta winning agenda." And the problem, at least in the eyes of some of the morestalwart movement conservatives quoted in the coverage, was that, on the GOPside, there wasn't enough of any other agenda. The WP quotes Gary Bauerof the Family Research Council complaining, "We just ran one of the leastideological campaigns we've run in years...." and a similar complaint fromRandy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition. But the NYTpoints out the dilemma the Republicans face if they respond by simplyideologically souping up, with this quote from a conservative Floridacongressman: "We've got to reach out and have more than Southern white malesrunning the Washington Republican Party."            The NYT and WP pass along a classic non-concession concession from Newt Gingrich. TheTimes version: "I mean, I totally underestimated the degree to whichpeople would just get sick of 24-hour-a-day talk television and talk radio andthen the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of disgusting bysheer repetition." In other words, explains the Post 's Howard Kurtz, ina "Style" section piece, it was the media's fault. Kurtz goeson to resurrect a Gingrich quote from earlier this year in which he said hewould never again as long as he was Speaker make a speech without commenting onthe scandal. And then for good measure, he quotes conservative muckety-muckBill Kristol's assessment of Gingrich's analysis: "mind-boggling." It's thatsort of chagrin that's behind the rumblings of a House coup all the papersreport.            The papers also say that an immediate consequence of the vote is at least adrastically scaled-down impeachment inquiry. They all report that Henry Hyde isnow leaning towards having his Judiciary Committee call only onewitness--Kenneth Starr. (The WP runs a separate article about this asits off-lead.) The WSJ says look for a quick negotiated resolution ofthe Lewinsky scandal between the Hill and the White House. And the NYTflatly asserts that the Republican majority is now so slim that "there islittle chance the 218 votes required for impeachment can be assembled."            The other big political story of the day is the election in the Minnesotagovernor's race of former pro wrestler Jesse "The Body" Ventura. The politicalupstart garners front-pagers at the LAT and NYT and an insidepiece at the WP . Ventura's out-of-the-blue arrival on the scene isenergizing the media in ways not seen since the early days of Ross Perot'sfirst candidacy. The LAT notes that Ventura, who will now become thehighest office-holder in Perot's Reform party, asked Perot for campaign money,but was turned down. The WP reports that Ventura's ad campaign wasmanaged by William Hillsman, who did the ads for the previous title-holder forMost Shocking Minnesota Campaign By A Former Wrestler--Paul Wellstone's upset1991 win of a U.S. Senate seat. (A previous pre-election Post story onex-Navy Seal Ventura barely mentioned that there has been some controversyabout his military service. This would be a fine time to elaborate.)            The NYT 's Ventura effort is accompanied by a color picture of thegovernor-elect trouncing a previous opponent--in 1985, by stomping him into theropes. The Times piece also includes the sounds-pretty-right assessmentof that astute political commentator, Hulk Hogan: "Jesse's victory proves that people want a realman in power to lead, not a play plastic puppet like other politicians."
