                                 China's Spiritual Void            China's banning of the Falun Gong (Buddhist Law) religious sect was stronglycondemned Friday by the South China Morning Post of Hong Kong. The paper said in aneditorial that China is facing more than enough crisesalready, from the economy to relations with Taiwan, and it should focus onthese problems rather than "launch a massive crackdown against a group whichhas never done anything more harmful than organise peaceful protests." The riseof Falun Gong is a byproduct of China's new materialism, it said. "The collapseof the ideological basis for communist rule in the rush towards a free-marketeconomy has left a spiritual void. It is inevitable that people thrown out ofwork or otherwise unsettled by the sweeping changes on the mainland should seeksolace in some form of religious-like activity. ... Beijing should consideritself fortunate that the popular desire for spiritual inspiration took such abenign form." Falun Gong's only sin was to build a mass organizationindependent of the Communist Party. "This is something the leadership is stillnot prepared to tolerate. For all the changes that have taken place in recentyears, yesterday's arrests were a reminder of how far freedom of expressionremains curtailed on the mainland." The paper reported that more than 70 FalunGong leaders were arrested in China this week, including Ji Liewu, a mainlandbusinessman in his 40s who was responsible for bringing the sect to HongKong.            Announcing the ban Friday, the official China Daily said thesect had engaged in illegal activities: advocating superstition and spreadingfallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances, andjeopardizing social stability. The paper also quoted Chinese Foreign Ministryspokeswoman Zhang Qiyue as saying that Falun Gong had been banned because ithad not been registered in the manner required by law. She also claimed thatthe sect had a declining membership of about 2 million, while other estimateshave put it as high as 100 million.            InIsrael, Ha'aretz ledFriday with the United States urgently pressing Prime Minister Ehud Barak tomake implementation of the Wye River accord his top priority and to carry outagreed Israeli pullbacks from the West Bank. Meanwhile, the U.S. administrationdecided to go easy on Syria, with President Bill Clinton postponing a plannedtelephone conversation with Syrian President Hafez Assad. Barak toldHa'aretz that "an air of suspicion is clouding the whole issue of Wye"and that "before this suspicion becomes mythology, it must be dispelled andunderstanding must be reached."            Friday's Guardian featured an interview with former Chilean President Gen. AugustoPinochet, who has been under house arrest for several months awaiting theoutcome of Spain's request that he be extradited and tried there for murder,torture, and other human rights violations. This is the second interviewPinochet has given since his arrest in London last year. The first, lastweekend, was with the conservative Sunday Telegraph , which opposes hisextradition. The liberal Guardian , by contrast, wants to see him tried,and its reporter, a former human rights activist, noted that his fingers are"flat and meaty like those of a butcher." The general's answers in bothinterviews were almost identical. He categorically denied all charges againsthim and complained about Britain's treatment of him. "I wasn't in England as acommon bandit," he said, in reference to his arrest. "I was here as adiplomatic figure and had been welcomed as such."            InGermany, the FrankfurterAllgemeine Zeitung led Friday on a UNICEF report that more children arenow born in poverty than ever before, and the paper discussed the growing AIDScatastrophe in Africa, where 21 million people are infected with the disease.Die Welt led on a newbirth control patch, developed by Johnson & Johnson, which it said wouldoffer strong competition to the pill when it is put on the market next year.The SddeutscheZeitung of Munich led on a new drive by the German government to getTurkey admitted to the European Union, provided its human rights record isacceptable.
