                                 Not Gotcha            My                   Slate                colleague Jacob Weisbergargues that the ... let's call it the unfolding of Vice PresidentGore's position on the great JointChiefs Gay Litmus Test issue was not sufficiently flip-floppy "toconstitute a 'reversal.'" Many commentators in                   Slate               's "Fray"echo this view, dismissing the whole controversy as a phony media game of"gotcha." I respectfully disagree.            First, of course it was a reversal. Initially, Gore said he wouldrequire that any Chiefs nominee be "in agreement with" his gay policy. Then hecame back and denied there should "ever be any kind of inquiry into thepersonal, political opinion of officers in the U.S. military." The only "litmustest," explained his adviser Robert Shrum, was the banal "constitutional one,civilian control of the military." Under Gore's Position No. 1, Colin Powelland Norman Schwarzkopf get bounced. Under Position No. 2, it would seem, theydon't, since they presumably agree with the principle of civilian control.            Weisberg says no, there is little functional difference between demanding"agreement" and Gore's second position (demanding constitutionally-required"support"), since Gore knows that those who disagree are likely to sabotage hispolicy. The only difference, Weisberg says, is that demanding "'support' ...leaves open the theoretical possibility of appointing a military officer sohonorable that he will work assiduously to implement a policy he personallydisagrees with." But under Gore's second position, Gore won't know whopersonally agrees or disagrees with his policy, since he says he won't inquireinto the actual views of Chiefs candidates. (Don't Ask, Don'tTell!)            More important, Weisberg assumes that Gore would never appoint somebody whodisagrees, and might therefore sabotage the policy (among disagreers, only thetheoretical perfectly honorable officer would pass muster). But it's exactlythat assumption that bothers those who worry about a "litmus test"--the ideaGore would give a privileged position to the gay issue, ruling out a candidatewho was otherwise a military genius and inspirational leader solely because hehad (in Gore's mind) retrograde views on gays.            That implication, in Gore's answer No. 1, is what made it genuinelytroubling, a legitimate gaffe. It suggested the vice president was so keen onhis gay policy that he would give it higher priority than other militaryissues, such as how to win wars (or counter the Chinese and Russian threats).Actually, given the crippling effect of the gay controversy on the first sixmonths of Clinton's presidency, it implied Gore was willing to give the gayissue priority over non-military issues as well. "Not that again!" you couldalmost hear voters saying. There are other, more important concerns for apresident than integrating gays into the armed forces. It's time for somesensible gay leader to point this out. (Andrew Sullivan, are you still readingthis?)            At best, Gore's gaffe revealed a candidate so eager to pander to aDemocratic constituency that he lost his bearings and overstepped the bounds ofgood political judgment. That's certainly forgivable--but wasn't Gore's uniqueselling proposition supposed to be his dull-but-sound reliability? You meanhe's boring and a bit of a hothead too?            P.S.: Weisberg's right to ridicule Gore's Position No. 2--why shouldn't apresident inquire into the personal views of a Joint Chiefs candidate, and tryto appoint someone who agrees with him? A general who disagrees with a policyis indeed likely to implement it unenthusiastically. Gore could have said,"Yes, I'll consider a candidate's views--I'd be naive not to--but I'll look atthe whole man, and the whole range of military issues, not just this oneissue." In somersaulting from personal-views-are-a-litmus-test to "I'll neverconsider personal views," Gore leapt completely over this sensible, obviousanswer. But that doesn't make his performance any less of a reversal, or anymore reassuring.
