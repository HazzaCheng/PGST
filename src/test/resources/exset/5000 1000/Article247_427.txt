                                 Funds and Games            At the Washington Post and New York Times ,scandalous political fund-raising leads. At the Los AngelesTimes , it's news of dramatic drops in California welfare rolls.USAToday 's top story is that a presidential commission is warning that thenation's public and private computer systems are gravely vulnerable tocyber-sabotage.            The cyber-commission's findings won't be handed in until Monday, butUSAT says they include such measures as establishing a center forcollecting information about all computer security breaches and creating aWhite House office to coordinate all the government's computer securityefforts. Former Sen. Sam Nunn tells the paper that the issue is right up therewith nuclear, chemical and biological weapons security.            The NYT 's lead reports that President Clinton denies that the coffeetapes mandated the appointment of an outside counsel and repeats that thefailure to turn over the tapes in a more timely manner was a "simple mistake,not deliberate defiance." The president also says that Republicans are usingthe tapes to divert attention from their defeat of the McCain-Feingold reformbill. Clinton made these remarks before embarking on a campaign fundraisingswing through New Jersey and Pennsylvania, made necessary in part by the largenumber of contributions to the DNC during the last election cycle that had tobe returned because they proved questionable. Meanwhile says the Timesand the other majors, at the Thompson hearings, former senior WH aide HaroldIckes also staunchly defended Clinton campaign finance practices.            The Post 's campaign finance lead is that a Pennsylvania landfillcompany has pleaded guilty to funneling $129,000 in illegal corporate donationsto ten political candidates--including the presidential campaigns of Clintonand Bob Dole--and agreed to pay a record $8 million fine. The scam here was thedisguising of company donations as individual donations. The Dole and Clintonofficials involved state that they had no reason to believe that the purportedindividual $1,000 donations weren't legit, even though some came fromsecretaries and clerks.            The NYT reports that today, the Clinton administration will announcethat it has persuaded handgun manufacturers to provide child-safety locks withall their products. Accidental shootings, says the paper, killed 185 childrenin 1994.            All the majors give front-page space to Alan Greenspan's inflation warningyesterday--and to the downward spiral it predictably caused in the financialmarkets. In recent testimony, the fed chairman had suggested that the Americaneconomy has entered some new sort of anti-inflationary era where tremendousincreases in productivity enable companies to absorb cost increases they wouldhave formerly passed along as price increases. But yesterday, Greenspanreturned to a straightforward reading of the Phillips curve: increasedemployment leads to higher wages, which leads to higher prices.                           USAT reports that flu shots drive down business absenteeism andhealth-care costs so much that companies are starting to entice and pressuretheir employees to get them. Eastman Kodak, for instance, says the shots saved$2.8 million in absenteeism just last year. But even though the company givesthe shots for free, 70 percent of its employees "won't take one in the deltoidfor the team." The leading causes of worker reticence seem to be fear ofgetting the flu from the shots and fear of needles.            The WP has word that a Dutch study today reports that when peoplestop smoking, overall health costs decline only in the short term, and after 15years, actually increase. Look for this study to be used by tobaccomanufacturers in an attempt to whittle the cost of any state or nationaltobacco deal, even though it merely illustrates the truism that dying of oldage is the most expensive way to go. After all, issuing handguns to allteenagers would cut overall health care costs too.            How have recent meat health scares affected the restaurant business? Well,according to the Wall Street Journal , you can still get a rare hamburger atthe Mountain Mist Ice Cream stand in Saranac Lake, N.Y.--but you do have tosign a liability waiver first.
