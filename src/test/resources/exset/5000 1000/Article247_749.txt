                                 Plugging in a Speaker            House politics continue to dominate. The WP leads with the de factoSpeakerhood of Rep. Robert Livingston. The LAT goes with the fractiousRepublican caucus he will try to lead, which the WSJ also addresses in afront-pager. The NYT goes instead with yesterday's Judiciary hearings at whichscholars said middle-ground outcomes like censuring the president had noconstitutional basis. The hearings are also the off-lead at the WP andmake the front at the LAT and USAT, which leads instead with the SupremeCourt's allowing the continuance of Wisconsin's program of subsidizing poorchildren's attendance at private and religious schools. This voucher storymakes the LAT and NYT fronts, but is played inside at thePost .            The WP , LAT and NYT each give the who's-up-who's-downon the House GOP wrangle but there is no clear sense communicated about what itall means. The LAT bothers to tell us that to hold together the HouseGOP caucus Livingston may have to, to coin a phrase, "resort to scotch tape andbailing wire," but doesn't tell us much about the ideological differencesoperating except to say that Livingston has been slammed by the WSJeditorial page and is also disliked by something called the Traditional ValuesCoalition. The coverage tells us that Livingston is apparently all about toneand management and (could this be the Jesse Ventura effect?) that he's a blackbelt in karate. But that's about it. For a topography of the House GOP, turn tothe Journal account, which nicely articulates the three main branches ofits conservatism: pragmatic, economic, and social.            As for the lesser offices in the hierarchy, the papers don't evencommunicate what they do. The reader has no idea what to make of learning that,for example, the vice chair of the House Republican Conference is challengingthe Majority Leader. The one exception to this complaint is the Post 'sreporting on the job of Majority Whip, Tom DeLay. Delay, it seems, was able tovector support to Livingston because he possesses the only really up-to-datelist of members' phone numbers and addresses.            The NYT observes that if the Republicans were looking for a way togracefully abandon impeachment, this was not in evidence at the Judiciaryhearings. The other papers see things the same way. Although it was Elbow Patchand Tweed Day at the committee, the NYT shows that often the academicwitnesses were just foils for members' speechifying. All the experts testifiedthat the standards for impeachment should be kept very high, but some of theRepublican members of the committee made it clear they felt that lying aboutsex qualified.            It's a bit sobering to read that the WP 's political dean, DavidBroder, refuses to bury Newt Gingrich's career in public life. His model forGingrich in '98 is Nixon in '62--down but not out. If, writes Broder, theDemocrats clobber the GOP in the 2000 presidential vote, Gingrich would bepositioned for a comeback, this time as a presidential candidate.            As an apparent conflict with Iraq looms, USAT reports on a visit madelast month to a Navy carrier now enroute to the Mediterranean. The paperreports that the ship is deployed with 250 fewer crew than it's supposed tohave, with the result that flight operations cannot be sustained at the tempocommanders would like. The paper reports that although the Navy denies that thecarrier's recent fatal flight deck collision had anything to do withshorthandedness, the service has experienced a rise in its flight accidentrate. The story quotes one civilian defense expert's assessment: there's plentyof money, it's just being spent on the wrong things--glamour weapons instead ofparts and manpower.            For those wondering how long Kenneth Starr's operation could stay inbusiness, the WP runs a story inside about the independent counselappointed to look into conflict of interest charges against Eli Segal, aone-time Clinton national service advisor. Nine months after getting the case,the IC recommended against prosecuting Segal, and no further action was takenagainst him. But more than a year after that, the office still exists, albeitdown to one attorney working about half time. Why? Well, says, the Post ,the office had to continue operating while those investigated or required totestify appealed for reimbursement of their legal expenses. And there's thecost in time and money of, as the law requires, turning over all paperwork tothe National Archives. And best of all, since any IC office must be audited bythe government every six months, someone must be retained to preside over theoffice while it's being audited. That's how the Segal IC is still managing tospend more than $250,000 a year.
