A BlackHole in Your Logic                        In"Big-BangTheology," Jim Holt writes:                           Maybe the universe hada natural cause. But the big bang could not have been caused by priorphysical processes. That is because it began with pointlike singularity ,which, according to relativity theory, is not a "thing" but a boundary or anedge in time. Since no causal lines can be extended through it, the cause ofthe big bang must transcend the physical world.            Thecenter of any black hole, according to modern physics, is also asingularity. So, does each and every black hole in the universe alsoprove the existence of God, since, according to Holt's argument as I understandit, "prior physical processes" could not have created them either?            -- Erich Schwarz NewYork City                           The Ageof Finiteness                                                         Slate                should probably know better than to publish an essay aimedat deducing the existence of God. Jim Holt's piece "Big Bang Theology"starts out that way, though he ultimately contents himself with the existenceof a First Cause. But he too quickly dismisses Stephen Hawking's argument thatthe finite age of the earth does not imply a beginning. To be sure, Hawking'sexplanation is rather convoluted. Let me see if I can find a simpler way topresent his view. Suppose that our position in time is represented by apositive (that is, non-negative and nonzero) number. Then at each moment weknow that only a finite amount of time has elapsed (if we're at time 5, then weknow that no more than 5 units of time have passed). But note that there is nofirst moment: if we're at time t, then time t/2, which is unequal to t, lies inour past. There you go: a universe with no beginning but a finite age.            -- JoydipKundu Cambridge, Mass.                           Winnie-the-Canuck                        Contrary to David Plotz's"Assessment," Winnie-the-Pooh is neither American nor British. Heis, in fact, Canadian. The original Winnie-the-Pooh was the mascot of aCanadian regiment, an actual living bear named for the city of Winnipeg. Winniefound himself in England when the regiment was transferred to England in theGreat War (or World War I). He was placed in a zoo for safekeeping when theregiment went on to France, and in this period Winnie became a great favoritewith the English zoo-going public.            And the fictionalWinnie-the-Pooh was named for the real bear, a bear born in Canada who neverrelinquished his Canadian citizenship.            So, ifthe bear is going anywhere, send him back to Canada. However, we put no claimon the other, lesser characters.            -- JohnTyrrell Medicine Hat, Alberta                           Bother,Eh?                        David Plotz's polemic as tothe citizenship of Winnie-the-Pooh serves only to stoke the fires ofcontroversy swirling around the five unfortunate dolls. Pooh is not American,but neither is he British or a "citizen of the world." He is Canadian. Poohscholars (there are such things) know that A.A. Milne was a visitor to theGreat White North and bought his son's teddy bear in Winnipeg, hence thename.            Besides,the British have Paddington Bear and the Yanks created the stern Smokey (asuitable symbol of American authoritarianism). In the interests of justice,Winnie must be ours!            -- John RobertsonGraham Vancouver, British Columbia                           BoopBoop a Doop, Indeed                        Regarding Jonathan Rauch's"ReichRedux"--of course all refined Washington, D.C., hostesses know that mintjelly is not a sauce but a jelly. You spread jelly on bread, like that piece ofbread the English call by the misnomer Yorkshire pudding. But they serve thatwith beef and put gravy on it, so I don't know what bread you spread your mintjelly on when it is served with lamb.            I for oneam more than a bit tired of the arrogant, ignoramus, false-elegantpretentiousness of Washington. All these refined ladies and gentlemen of theWashington elite should learn to keep their mouths shut so as not toincriminate themselves. Boop boop a doop, dearie.            -- Judith Nelson                                       Addressyour e-mail to the editors to letters@slate.com.
