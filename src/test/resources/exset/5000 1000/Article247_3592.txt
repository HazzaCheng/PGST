                                 Good Sports            Although international affairs lead all papers, above-the-fold photos ofSerena Williams celebrating her U.S. Open victory dominate the front pages. TheNew York Times leads withthe restarting of negotiations over China's entry into the World TradeOrganization; the other papers refer the story. The Los AngelesTimes leads with an exclusive: In an interview a Yugoslav generalthreatened to reenter Kosovo by force if the United Nations does not allow Serbsoldiers back into the province. The Washington Post leads with Indonesia's softening stance onallowing peacekeepers into violence-torn East Timor; the other papers alsofront the story.            The chief of Indonesia's armed forces, Gen. Wiranto, expressed willingnessto accept an "accelerated deployment" of peacekeeping troops. Hours laterWiranto reframed his message by saying that he would consider "securitycooperation." Indonesia's U.N. ambassador asserted that it was not time forpeacekeepers. President Clinton suggested that the U.S. military might offerlogistical support for an Australian-led peace force. The Post reportsthat a 10-member U.S. military team arrived in Australia to help plan for anEast Timor operation.            The NYT boldly heads its story "Jakarta Concedes A Loss of Control,"but the LAT makes clear that no coherent message is emanating fromJakarta. The paper underscores that Gen. Wiranto made his comments in informaltalks with a U.N. delegation he was escorting around East Timor. The generalacknowledged that some of his troops might be allying themselves with violentanti-independence militia groups.            The LAT and NYT report that during the high-ranking U.N.delegation's visit to East Timor no shots were heard, but the officials couldsee that the city was in ruins. In the East Timorese U.N. compound, civilianscowered in fear of the next paramilitary onslaught. The Post reviewsevidence of atrocities tied to the Indonesian military. A human rights groupreported that hundreds of East Timorese have been shot or hacked to death,including: U.N. employees, members of the Red Cross, priests, and infants.            Presidents Clinton and Jiang Zemin instructed their negotiators to resumetalks on China's entry into the WTO. Negotiations soured last April whenClinton rejected a promising deal. Espionage allegations and the bombing ofChina's Belgrade embassy further stalled relations. The NYT assesses themeeting as a significant sign that the rift between China and the U.S. ishealing. The Post fronts a photo of Jiang and Clinton sharing agood-natured laugh, but its inside account emphasizes that the leaders made "notangible progress." The paper cautions that it remains unclear whether Chinawill recommit to cutting its tariffs to 10 percent and phasing out importrestrictions in exchange for WTO membership.            The Yugoslav army claims it might invade Kosovo because the U.N. has failedto protect non-Albanian civilians. The LAT reports that Serbparamilitaries may already be infiltrating Kosovo through the French-protectedsector of the province. A senior French commander acknowledged thatpeacekeeping officials suspect Serbian paramilitaries are permeating northernKosovo and stirring up unrest.            A political brief in the NYT reports that during a recent trip toBoston Al Gore announced a $5 million aid package for New England's fishingindustry, even though the program was approved a year ago. The piece isostensibly based on a Boston Globe story. On Friday the RepublicanNational Committee sent news organizations two press releases highlighting theGlobe story. The releases are the latest in a series of "World Accordingto Gore" faxes that cast the vice-president as a political opportunist. TheNYT brief cited one condemnatory quote from the Globe story, thesame quote that the RNC underlined and boldfaced in its attack fax.            All papers note that Serena Williams is the first African-American to takethe women's U.S. Open title in more than 40 years. After Martina Hingis beatSerena's sibling in the semi-finals, seventeen-year-old Serena defeated Hingisin straight sets. Serena's father had predicted an all-Williams final. TheNYT notes that his comment provoked Martina to call Mr. Williams a "bigmouth." Serena volleyed by attributing Hingis' remark to her "lack of formaleducation."
