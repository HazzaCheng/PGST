                                 Suckers for a Story                           USAToday leads with the angry reaction from many in business to thegovernment's just-proposed guidelines for fighting workplace repetitive stressinjuries. The Los Angeles Times lead covers essentially the same ground,while also explaining the difference between the new rules and currentCalifornia law. Both stories report that the rules, which mandate variouscorrective actions at the first sign of injury, will cost companies anaggregate $4.2 billion per year. The Washington Post leads with the imminent release of thelargest Pentagon study ever of racial attitudes within the uniformed military.The results are somewhat bracing for an institution that portrays itself asremarkably colorblind: some three-quarters of minority service membersresponding say they've experienced racism, and more than half doubted thatdiscrimination complaints are thoroughly investigated. And the survey showsthat military whites have a drastically more positive view. The paper quotesone defense official as saying the study was actually concluded two years ago,but release was delayed while the brass debated how to portray the results. TheNew York Times fronts thesurvey--adding that a second DOD report shows that black personnel get promotedat a much lower rate than whites--but leads instead with the news that the CityUniversity of New York has approved a plan that would bar remedialstudents.            Both the USAT and LAT leads include criticisms from a vicepresident of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who apparently was once told to giveevery reporter something unique. He tells the former that trying to implementthe new workplace safety regs will be like getting your arms around a"marshmallow," and he tells the latter it will be like getting your arms arounda bowl of "Jell-O." But the coverage itself suggests the squishiness of thesubject matter. The number of relevant workplace injuries mentioned (by theNYT ) in yesterday's coverage was 600,000, but today's USAT andWall Street Journal (in an inside story) up the anteto 1.8 million. The LAT lead's headline--"OSHA Scales Back Its NewWorkplace Safety Plan"--and its first paragraph suggest that the government hasquickly caved in to the protesting business world, whereas the story itselfexplains that the rules were softened last February, not yesterday.            A front-page WP story and one flagged in the WSJ front-pagebusiness news box report that the judge in the Microsoft trial was motivated tobring in an outside mediator by his worries about a rift over possible remedies developing between DOJ lawyers andthose representing 19 states. The rift--with the state lawyers favoring moreaggressive actions against Microsoft, such as carving the company up or forcingit to share its operating system code--has been previously reported on in theNYT .            The NYT fronts and the WP carries inside Bill Bradley's speechMonday in which he charged that Al Gore had little interest in campaign-financereform because the current money-raising system favors incumbents. TheTimes calls the speech one of Bradley's strongest efforts yet to portrayhimself as an outsider and reformer, but also notes that with it, Bradley risksoffending many Democrats in that he is mirroring Republican criticisms raisedagainst the Clinton White House fund-raising apparatus a few years back.            An inside NYT story by veteran reporter Francis X. Clines tells of anew growth industry--companies specializing in cleaning up the messes left byhomicides and suicides. More than 200 such outfits have started up in recentyears, creating concern that the government should establish public healthstandards for the field, like it has already for funeral parlors.            Quick Quiz: Today's WSJ front page features a 1,140-word articleabout Bill Bradley's a) criticism of Al Gore's campaign-finance stance; b)health-care plan; c) Web site as a voter outreach tool; or d) lozenges. Theanswer is d). This kind of drivel is the direct result of a presidentialcampaign that started about a year too early. Candidates aren't saying much ofsubstance yet but are still out there working the rooms and the press feelsthey still have to cover them.            A reader query prompts Today's Papers to wonder about last Sunday'sobituaries for longtime Italian politician Amintore Fanfani. Turns out thatthere's a virtually identical 54-word passage appearing in both the NYTobit, running over the byline of Alessandra Stanley, and in the WP obit,credited to "News Services." Who took from whom? And does this smidgeon oftheft still count as full-blown plagiarism?
