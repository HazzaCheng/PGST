                                 Flowers of Banality            Poinsettias took Issue 1honors as Fox News Sunday , NBC's Meet the Press , CBS's Facethe Nation , CNN's Late Edition , ABC's This Week , and TheMcLaughlin Group displayed festive Euphorbia pulcherrima on theirsets. None of the pundits spoke about the flowers, which are members of thespurge family and native to Mexico and Central America. The flowers spoke forthemselves.            Attemptsto elevate the International Monetary Fund's $55-billion (and climbing) bailoutof South Korea to Issue 2 fizzled despite the attempts of three shows-- FoxNews Sunday , NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , and This Week-- to putit there.                   Slate                columnist Paul Krugman cemented the consensusopinion that the known risk of lending the Koreans billions was far less scarythan the unknown risk of doing nothing ( This Week ).            Besides flowers, the main theme of the weekend gabfests wasthe Year in Review. The pundits happily recycled their hoariest 1997 soundbites in a road-rage rampage of drive-by analysis. Their quick and dirtytargets: the balanced budget; the booming economy; the campaign-financescandal; the death of Diana, Princess of Wales; the stock market; Ellen ;race; sex in the military; Asia's economic meltdown; China; Tony Blair; Bosnia;Iraq; the menace of the tabloid press; Bill Clinton's good luck; Al Gore'srotten luck; porn on the Internet; Microsoft; Dolly. The more formulaic shows(CNN's Capital Gang , The McLaughlin Group , Fox NewsSunday ) offered predictions for 1998 and "awards" (Worst Politician,Biggest Loser, Brightest New Face) to disguise their lack of enterprise, whilethe more somber programs dodged hard work with toasts to their last 50 years( Meet the Press ), their last 30 years ( Washington Week inReview ), and their last year ( Face the Nation ).            Issue 3was the public's growing disdain for Washington and politics. As in previousweeks, the two leading conservative commentarians celebrated political apathyas an indication of "national health" (George Will, This Week ) and "asign of contentment and success of a society" (Charles Krauthammer, InsideWashington ). Giving the conservative theme greater legitimacy were GwenIfill ( Meet the Press ) and Mary McGrory ( Meet the Press ), whoattributed the new apathy to the new prosperity. "Dow Jones is more importantthan Paula Jones," said McGrory.            Michael Beschloss ( Face the Nation )linked Washington's lost vitality to the end of the imperial presidency, whileother Face the Nation yakkers (Bob Schieffer, Stephen Carter, and EllenGoodman) pinned it on politicians and the presidents who have failed to frameour pressing problems (race, Social Security insolvency, women's issues) inpolitical terms. Doris Kearns Goodwin ( This Week ) cited TheodoreRoosevelt's conservation campaign and Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty duringa time of prosperity as examples of how a leader can mobilize the people with apublic challenge. Now, said Mark Shields ( Face the Nation ), we have apresident who endorses contradictory initiatives like teen curfew andmidnight basketball.                           L Is for Legacy: GwenIfill double dribbled her observation that the L word currently hauntingClinton is "legacy," not liberalism ( Washington Week in Review andMeet the Press ).                           Say Something Twice, WhySay It Again? Mark Shields triple dribbled his astonishment that a newopinion poll will crown Clinton the most popular president ever( NewsHour , Capital Gang , Face the Nation ).                           Go to the Mirror,Boy: John McLaughlin designated fellow commentarian George Stephanopoulosthe year's "Most Boring Person" for his "predictable and platitudinouscommentary" on This Week .                           Tongue Bath of theWeek: Wrapping up Evans & Novak 's "interview" with Donald Trump,serial flatterer Robert Novak offered this stroke job: "I was surprised [Trump]showed a lot of charm, maybe even charisma."                           --JackShafer
