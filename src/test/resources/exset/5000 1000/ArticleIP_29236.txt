                                 What Is Permissiveness?            It'snot easy to tell from the European press where NATO is heading on Kosovo. Thereseems to be a consensus around Joseph Fitchett's statement in the leadstory in Monday's International Herald Tribune of Paris that June 18, the dateof a summit between the G-7 countries and Russia, is a "make-or-break date forthe air war to produce a political solution." If no breakthrough occurs bythen, Fitchett explained, NATO will have to choose between ground action and anadmission that President Slobodan Milosevic has won, because NATO's central waraim of getting the Kosovar refugees home will have become unachievable. Butbeyond that, there is no clarity on who stands where on what, especially on thecontroversial issue of ground troops.            TheIndependentof London led Monday, for example, on an agreement between the United Statesand Britain to use ground troops "to drive the remaining Serb forces fromKosovo" in either a "permissive" or "non-permissive" environment. NATO is"ready to go in fighting," it said. And the Times , in its lead storyreporting a doubling of NATO's land force in Macedonia, said that BritishForeign Secretary Robin Cook has "secured America's backing for the forces toenter Kosovo without Belgrade's approval as soon as the Serb army beginswithdrawing."            However the Daily Telegraph , leading on the same thing, reported "a differencebetween Washington and London about whether troops could be sent into Kosovowithout Belgrade's agreement." It quoted Madeleine Albright as contradictingCook's "significant" statement that the troops are being prepared fordeployment into a "non-permissive environment." She was quoted as saying,"Those troops are going to go in a permissive way." Under the headline "Britainand US clash again on when to send in troops," the tabloid Daily Mailsaid Albright had "flatly contradicted" Cook. In an editorial, theIndependent presented the agreed build-up of ground troops as a triumphfor British Prime Minister Tony Blair after his "surprising and apparentlyreckless absolutism in his conduct of the war" by ruling out any "exitstrategy" except total victory. "Even when President Clinton and ChancellorSchrder were at their most flaky last week, he blithely insisted there couldbe no compromise and that all options, including the use of land forces,remained open," it said. Now he has what he wanted.            ATimes of London editorial described Al Gore as a casualty of the war. Itsaid it has made his "essential task" of putting some distance between himselfand Clinton much harder. "Mr. Gore cannot do anything other than support thePresident's conduct of the conflict," it explained. "He is therefore tied to anenterprise that has, so far, reflected Mr. Clinton's political weaknesses. Hehas never felt comfortable with his role as Commander-in-Chief, and neither hashis electorate." In Paris, Libration led on Clinton's statement Sunday in the NewYork Times that he is continuing with the airstrikes but not ruling out"other options." It called this "a semi-threat of ground intervention."Le Figarohighlighted a NATO spokesman's remark that the 19 countries of the alliance are"99 per cent totally agreed" on their Kosovo strategy, although Germany, Italy,and Greece are among countries that last week declared their firm opposition tothe use of ground troops. Le Figaro led on NATO's supposed satisfactionwith its achievements so far--14,000 bombs having destroyed a third of Serbia'sheavy weaponry and 100 of its airplanes.            TheAsian Age ofIndia led Monday with a report that a "fascist clique" is responsible for a plot toassassinate Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of former Indian PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi, who was himself assassinated. A delegation of theCongress Party, of which Sonia Gandhi was president until she recently resignedin a huff when her "foreign birth" was criticized, warned Indian Prime MinisterAtal Bihari Vajpayee that the same "clique" that murdered Mahatma Gandhi morethan 51 years ago was behind it. The paper said the prime minister has alreadybeen warned of "certain plots" against Sonia Gandhi by the Indian intelligenceagencies and has increased the security around her. The Daily Telegraphran an interview with former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in whichshe said that she too feared she would be murdered and had therefore decided tostay in Britain rather than return to Pakistan to fight a conviction forcorruption.
