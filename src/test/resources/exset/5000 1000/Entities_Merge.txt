Area Legal Aid Entities MergeBy Analisa NazarenoJuly 6, 2002The letterhead on correspondence still bears the Bexar CountyLegal Aid name, even though the organization is no longer.Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimescontroversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week tookover four other corporations serving the legal needs of theindigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County.The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named andstretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin.The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans."I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can doto address the serious problems of poverty than the number of caseswe close," said David Hall, the TRLA executive director.In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separategroups to assist small-business owners and residents withlow-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate alegal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky.Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor moreefficient by working with law students who will handle lesscomplicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more"high impact" cases to court."What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can,leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there andmaximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,"Hall said.His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams workingon specialized legal issues.He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary'sUniversity Law School to involve students at the University ofTexas Law School.The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients,assist them with filling out legal documents and answer thetelephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handlethe complicated cases, Hall said.By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys workingwith the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the samecomputer network so they can pass cases to the best availableattorneys.Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of CentralTexas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying thatthe mergers were done illegally and without the input of boardmembers. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hamperedtheir ability to garner funds from Congress.TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneyschallenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in ValVerde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku KluxKlan member won a county commissioner post.Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar Countygroup, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive movefor South Texas."I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knewthat there were bad points," Gill said. "Now I'm hoping toaccentuate the good points and hope that will minimize the badpoints."Gill now heads the newly merged group's elder law team.Some changes, including eliminating pay differences betweenattorneys as well as staff support members across the state andtechnology training, could be two years in the making, Hall said.Another issue is whether to change the name of Texas Rural LegalAid so that it reflects the territory's diverse landscape."Overall, I think the change will be good," said Richard Loza, aSan Antonio attorney and the local coordinator for the bargainingunit of the National Organization of Legal Services Workers. "Ithink that the poor population in the true rural areas will benefitfrom more attorneys with a wide range of expertise. Someone inNatalia that may not otherwise have access to an attorney forcounsel or advice will be able to have that."Since last year, Hall has been meeting with nonprofit leadersand others who expressed concern that a merger would mean lessrepresentation for the poor in their communities."I know change can be difficult, but I think we need to give ita chance," said Joyce Coleman, who as director of Family ViolencePrevention Services worked with Bexar County Legal Aid to providelegal assistance to women in the Battered Women's Shelter."I think it may actually be a good thing for Texas," Colemansaid."Larger is not always better, but sometimes it can be."
