                                 The New Hart Show            The papers deliver a quiet, analysis-heavy Sunday, with no overlap among thefront pages. The New York Timesdetails vast wastefulness at the Veterans Administration. The Los AngelesTimes describes the legal defense of Wen Ho Lee, the suspected LosAlamos spy. And the Washington Post mulls over the causes of partisandivisiveness in Congress.            The NYT lead indicts the Veterans Administration for wasting over $1million a day on maintaining unnecessary and underpopulated facilities. Thenumber of veterans is shrinking and the popularity of outpatient treatment isgrowing, but the VA stubbornly refuses to close its unneeded hospitals-- eventhough, according to a GAO report, the money saved could be better spent onenhanced care for veterans. Veterans' groups view the facilities as "a nationalasset that must be preserved" and insist that they "have earned the right tocare."            The LAT offers a sneak preview of Wen Ho Lee's defense againstcharges that he committed espionage at the Los Alamos nuclear facility. TheJustice Department will decide in the coming weeks if and on what counts toprosecute Lee. His lawyers tell the DOJ that when Lee transferred classifiedfiles to an unprotected local area network, he was merely making backups incase the originals crashed. They also call the potential prosecution a resultof anti-Chinese/Taiwanese xenophobia.            The WP lead reports that despite their recent mergers andtriangulations into each other's ideological territory, Democrats andRepublicans in Congress are unusually adverse to compromise. The Republicanschose to risk a veto on their tax cut rather than settle for a smaller one, andthe Democrats refused to support light restrictions on gun control when theirstricter package was defeated. Potential causes for the inflexibility includepost-impeachment rancor, pre-2000 election shadowboxing, and the GOP's waningmajority in the House. Even the President, normally an avid deal-cutter, mayprefer to let issues such as Medicare and gun control stall, in the hope thatthey will later fuel the election of his wife and his vice president.            A WP front-pager narrates how George W. Bush has already seducedpowerful trade group lobbyists, who usually wait to lavish their money andsupport until a party's nominee is chosen. Specifically, Bush has used thelobbyists as a conduit to their bosses. He has already registered donationsfrom 1,542 CEO types, as opposed to the 264 who have shelled out for Al Gore.The piece implies that the Bush campaign is hypocritical: although it "aspiresto outside-the-Beltway populism," it has "eagerly exploited every advantage ...Washington has to offer."            A NYT front-pager calls Bill Bradley a canny underdog in the contestfor the Democratic presidential nomination. In addition to conserving hisresources, Bradley has consciously avoided the mistakes made by otheronce-promising potential giant-killers. "We're Gary Hart but we have money. ...We're Gary Hart but we know the rules," brags a Bradley aide. The story is thelatest in a spate of NYT pieces to feature a quote embarrassing to theGore camp. "The Vice President's office asked me, 'Why are you saying all thesegreat things about Bradley? Why don't you say things about us?' " relays theIowa Democratic chairman.            A WP piece inside the front section attests to why Steve Forbes is asharp businessman, if not a savvy candidate. Despite his regular eviscerationof George W. Bush, Forbes rented 6,000 names from his magazine's subscriptionlist to the Bush camp. "We reach a desirable group," explained a Forbesmagazine representative.            According to the WP , Europeans are being widely cautioned to avoidstaring at the total solar eclipse that will take place Aug. 11. Watching thesun's emergence from lunar shadow could damage or even eradicate their vision.But Druids have other reasons for averting their eyes when the sun and the moonmerge. "A god and goddess are making love," said an English moon worshipper."We have no right to look upon it."
