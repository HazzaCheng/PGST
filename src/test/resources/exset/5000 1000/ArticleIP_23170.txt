Randy'sWrap-Up                        Judging by News Quizparticipants--and I do--the two groups likeliest to express nasal disdain arefilm critics and political opponents. This is a disturbing ceding of the fieldto professionals. It is, for instance, the right of every American to carpabout his boss (I believe that's in the Constitution) and his relatives (theBible). But there is a recent reluctance to fire at certain targets unless onehas impressive credentials, a professionalizing of contumely. This islamentable and unnecessary. Remember (using Ginkoba if need be) what Johnsonsaid about literary criticism: "You may scold a carpenter who has made you abad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to maketables." Although as any trained Johnson scholar can tell you, the Great Chamclearly did not mean you should criticize News Quiz because you're discontentwith the replies selected for Page 1.                           Really, ReallySorry Answer                        The Rev.

The weeping ministerspoke in Largo, Fla., as he was sentenced to five and a half years in prisonfor swindling more than $4 million from the National Baptist Convention USA,the country's largest black denomination, while serving as its president. "Icannot shake the feeling that I have let so many people down," he added. Well,yeah.
