                                 Dawn of an Icon?                        Dear Tim,            You're right. There is not A Dawn for All Seasons. Ifnovels were furniture, I would not try to sell her to people who insist onMission, or Shaker. To some, her work will feel too busy and gewgawed-up. Asmart reader I know snarled, "Her stuff feels so dated." I didn't even botherto rush to the defense. (By the way, that was one of my favorite letters--theone where Powell complains about the challenge of working with timely material."When I started that book the hero could get a telephone call for a nickel ...I would read over a chapter and think of my vast teenage reading public saying,'What's a nickel, mommy?'")            Part of me, I admit, doesn't want to share her. It'slike having a newspaper broadcast the address of your favorite quiet littlerestaurant. Hard not to wince at the notion of belonging to a Dawn cult.            The novelist Tom Mallon, who has written a book ondiaries and is working on a book about letters, e-mailed me: "I like DawnPowell, though she's now one of those writers in the curious position of beingknown more for her life than her work. I've read or browsed more of the lettersand diaries and biography than I have her books. As Paul Bowles is supposed tohave said about his rediscovery as an old man: 'It's too much too late.'" TheBowles analogy is an interesting one. He was hipper than the hippies whoembraced him, and the charm is that he got there first. Similarly, Powell seemsto have understood things about the culture--about ambition, about sexualpolitics--ahead of her time.            I have mixed feelings about a writer's becomingiconographic in this way. My first reaction is to fear it's the death of awriter once he's in a position to do his own Gap ads (what product does JohnIrving model: Rolexes?). On the other hand, maybe it's a good thing, if iteventually leads people to the work. You lure college coeds in black with noserings to Plath through The Bell Jar and thehullabaloo over her marriage to Hughes, and sooner or later they're going toactually confront the ferocious, complex poems. (And by the way, Plath, too, isoften funny. Almost typed "hysterically" funny; the etymology of that wordreminds us about the problems of being a witty woman.)            Generally, I'm not very interested in what writers are"really" like. I know a slew of 'em, and can attest that there's no "irony" ina writer's being better--or at least different--on the page than in person. Allof us are. That's what motivates us to write, after all: the rifts between ouractual lives and the much richer imagined possibilities. So I don't generallyenjoy writers' biographies. Like Powell, who admitted that she probably knewJohn Dos Passos too intimately to evaluate his work, it often sours things forme to have insider information about a writer's inspirations or sourcematerial. Just as an example: I almost wish I didn't know that the inscriptionEmma Bovary put on the walking stick she gave to her lover, Rodolphe, wasstolen verbatim from a gift that Gustave Flaubert got himself, from his loverLouise Colet. Gus was a boor and a hick and probably deserved his horriblesyphilitic death. Nevertheless, Madame Bovary is agreat book.            My anti-biography bias confessed, I'd also say thatPowell's life and art seem unusually seamless. You meet the same cleareyed,jaunty, generous, doleful, complicated people in many of her characters thatshe offers in person. Or at least as close to "in person" as letters anddiaries can get us. It's hard to say this without embarrassment, so GirlScout-y does it sound, but she's as close as I've found to a Role Model. (Mustbe a common sentiment among her minions. Gerald Howard called his excellentpiece about her in Salon "How Dawn Powell Can SaveYour Life.")            I've really enjoyed talking to you. I would ask you tofax me through a sample of Dawn's handwriting, so I could do some amateurgraphology. But maybe that's too hagiographic, too Elvis- or PrincessDiana-adoring, even for this fan. Anyhow, I know you're on the road, with theSt. Louis Symphony Orchestra. How a music guy became this involved with anovelist is a very intriguing question that we never got to here. But I trustthat your outsider status would have pleased her enormously.            Warmly,Lisa
