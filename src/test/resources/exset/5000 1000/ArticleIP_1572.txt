                                 The War Room Strikes Back                           Hold, a 30-second clipproduced for the Clinton campaign by Bob Squier of Squier, Knapp &Ochs.                        Republican commercials arelaboring to make taxes and character the central issues of the presidentialcampaign. The Clinton War Room--a state of mind this year, not a place--strikesback with Hold , a tough, frontal (and potentially dangerous) responseprepared by adman Bob Squier at the direction of the president's chiefstrategist, Dick Morris.            The Clinton ad begins notwith the issue of taxes but with character, accusing Dole of engaging in theold "attack" politics (proving once again that the best use of negatives can beaccusing the other guy of going negative). The bold red chyrons used in thead--scarlet letters that appear here and later in the spot--are a chromaticcharge of wrongdoing leveled against Dole. Hold both responds to the taxattacks made by Dole and sows seeds of doubt about future Republican assaults.The timing is excellent: According to the polls, Clinton has been attacked sooften that he is in need of a Teflon coating.                           Hold presents Dolein age-emphasizing black-and-white videotape, with a drawing of the Capitol inthe background, indicating that the former senator hasn't left that unpopularvenue. Color footage, complete with a shot of the Marine band in thebackground, lends Clinton presidential depth and authority. The ad argues thatClinton cut taxes, thereby confronting both the tax issue and theconventional wisdom about him and his party. (Voters believe that Clintonraised taxes and generally resist any argument that Democrats are better atreducing taxes.)            The danger of Holdlies in its boldness. If taxes became the defining issue, the terrain wouldnaturally favor Dole. But if Clinton seizes the tax issue, what does Dole haveleft? This calculus of risk and gain reflects the thinking of Morris, a Clintonconsultant in the early '80s who switched parties and often deployed taxes as awedge issue to get Republicans elected.            Clinton's claim inHold that he has cut taxes for "working families" is based on the EarnedIncome Tax Credit, which helps the working poor. The choice oflanguage--"working families"--plays on the fact that most Americans viewthemselves that way. The narration and visual swiftly move on to "tax creditsfor college"--which polls report as more popular than Dole's widely anticipatedproposal for a 10 or 15 percent across-the-board tax cut.                           Hold discounts thepopular assumption that Republicans are tax cutters by citing areas where it'sbelievable that they would increase taxes--"working families" and "SocialSecurity"--areas where Democrats have the natural advantage. Dole, again inghostly black and white, is paired with Gingrich (who owns the highest negativeratings of any national figure) in footage that runs in slow motion, making himlook older and less vigorous. Meanwhile, a list of Dole tax increases scrollsup the screen, annotated with specific bill numbers as proof.            Dole's tax-raising sinsare totaled in red at $900 billion. Even "Republicans" are appalled, the spotsuggests, citing a Time magazine article (from 12 years ago). Theappalled Republican quoted in the magazine--but not named in the spot--is NewtGingrich, who was then a backbencher in the House.            Dole appears briefly incolor--a visual cue that we are now watching him on the stump and not inCongress--and promises that we are about to see "the real Bob Dole." Thisimplies that there are at least two Doles, setting up the conclusion that thecampaigning, tax-cutting Dole is the phony. The real Dole, the spot tellsus--and not just in words--is the aged career politician who has spent 35 yearsraising your taxes.                           Hold goes againstthe grain of popular assumptions about Democrats and taxes; but it doesn't needto convince completely. The tactic is to fight Dole to a draw or a near-draw onthe tax issue; that would be an intermediate victory for Clinton, and make aNovember victory more likely.            --Robert Shrum
