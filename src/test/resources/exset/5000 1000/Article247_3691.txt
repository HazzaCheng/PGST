                                 Steve Ballmer's Bunk                        Steve Ballmer spoke, and the stock market trembled. Toobad it didn't yawn.            Ballmer is president of Microsoft (which,incidentally--well, I hope just incidentally, since I sure do like my job--owns                  Slate               ), and lastThursday, in a post-speech question-and-answer period, he told the Society ofAmerican Business Editors and Writers that the stock market's valuation of"technology stocks," including Microsoft, was "absurd." Ballmer's commentsalmost singlehandedly drove the tech-heavy Nasdaq--"tech-heavy" is an adjectivepermanently attached to "Nasdaq"--to its worst performance in five months andsent Microsoft's shares (which, full disclosure, I own) down 5 percent.            As just about everyone has remarked, Ballmer's commentswere nothing new. Microsoft's CFO, Greg Maffei, told analysts this summer thatthe company's stock valuation was "ludicrous," and Ballmer told those sameanalysts that investors' expectations for Microsoft's future growth were"outlandish." Microsoft execs in general are well-known for downplaying thecompany's future prospects. Bill Gates himself supposedly told his father tosell his Microsoft stock soon after the company went public and saw its sharessoar to what then must have seemed like stratospheric levels. (Sensibly, Gates'dad declined the advice.)            Ballmer also has a clear incentive to talk downMicrosoft's stock price, at least in the short term. A higher stock price makesit more difficult to lure employees with stock options, and, more important,makes existing options more expensive. And keeping investor expectationsmoderate is a good way of making sure you meet those expectations.            But even if Ballmer's comments had been completelyunexpected and completely unrelated to any of Microsoft's broader corporategoals, they should not have moved the market, because Steve Ballmer knows lessabout the appropriate valuation of technology stocks than the market does.            The value of a company depends essentially on twothings: the free cash flow (cash above and beyond expenses, including its costof capital, and reinvestment) that the company generates and the length of timethe company is able to continue generating free cash flow. In valuing companieslike Microsoft, Cisco (which I also own shares of), Intel, and Dell so highly,then the market is saying two things: These companies are generatingextraordinary amounts of free cash flow (which they are), and they will be ableto continue generating that kind of cash for a considerable length of time.            Now, the first point is not really arguable. By anymeaningful measure of economic performance, the dominant U.S. technologycompanies today are among the most successful and profitable in the history ofthe world. (I say that for effect, but I'm not exaggerating.) The second point,which has to do with the sustainability of this domination, is presumably theone Ballmer finds so objectionable. With technology changing as rapidly as itseems to be, Ballmer is arguing, no company can really be sure of staying ontop for a long time.            Now, I think Ballmer is wrong about these valuations,which is to say wrong about the future. (That's why I own shares in some ofthese companies.) Now, the fact that I think Ballmer is wrong is basicallyirrelevant (except, perhaps, to my future here). The fact that the marketthinks Ballmer is wrong is, however, very important.            Our natural inclination, after all, is to imagine thatsomeone in Steve Ballmer's position must know a lot more than everybody elseabout something like the valuation of technology stocks. But to succumb to thatinclination is to reject the most important lesson taught by the triumph ofcapitalism, which is that markets process information, judge the future, andallocate capital far more efficiently and successfully than any individual, nomatter how well-positioned, possibly can. We don't trust central plannersanymore because we know they can never know as much as or react as quickly asmarkets can. And we shouldn't dump our Microsoft stock because Steve Ballmersays it's too expensive for the very same reason.
