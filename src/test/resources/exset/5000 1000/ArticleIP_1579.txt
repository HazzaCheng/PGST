Windows or Mac; downloadtime, 16 minutes at 14.4K                           Tell --the Clintoncampaign's new spot that aired two days before Bob Dole's acceptancespeech--all but defines a rapid-response ad.            The spot capitalizes onthe ambivalence greeting Dole's 15 percent tax-cut proposal: The latestCBS/ New York Times poll shows that voters aren't sure the cut is goodfor the country, but still favor it 61 percent to 33 percent. Tell 'sstrategy is to highlight the cut's dangers without mentioning the benefits.                           Tell begins withshots of the "Old Dole" filmed in the "attack colors" of black and white. Itrips Dole's economic proposal, but avoids calling it a tax cut. Instead, thenarrator warns of "Dole's risky economic scheme. ... He still won't tell us howhe'll pay for it all." The word "risky," displayed as a bold chyron atop theDole footage, bolsters this idea. So does a quotation from BusinessWeek --also shown as a bold chyron--asserting that under the Dole plan, wecan expect the "deficit to balloon."            That Dole is silent abouthow he'll finance his "scheme" makes his plan sound like a Democratic giveawayprogram. This is more political jujitsu from Clinton guru Dick Morris, whocontinues to pre-empt the other side.            Although the Dole proposalis straight out of Reagan's 1980 tax-cut playbook, Tell tilts notagainst Reagan, but against Bush. The next shots plunge the viewer into scenesfrom the Bush recession: an empty factory; a family apparently struggling topay its bills; a "Plant Closed" sign; a bold "1991" chyron over a poster for agoing-out-of-business sale. Tell poses the question, "Are you better offthan you were five years ago?" and suggests that a vote for Dole would returnus to the grim black and white of the past.            The spot's next target isthe Republican Congress. The narrator says that "Dole's campaign co-chair, Sen.D'Amato" (note the studied political correctness of "co-chair") might raiseMedicare premiums to "help" pay for Dole's "promises." Again, there is nomention of the 15 percent tax cut--and the word "help" reminds the viewer thatwe still don't know how the Dole plan will be financed. The message is drivenhome as the camera pans across a doctor's office to an elderly woman in awheelchair.            Medicare is what broke theGingrich Congress, so Tell naturally pairs Gingrich with Dole, who isshown yielding the microphone to Newt. Better than any narrator's accusations,this visual conveys the argument that it if Dole wins, Gingrich will run thegovernment and cut Medicare, Social Security, education. Positioning Gingrich,not Jack Kemp, as Dole's running mate will be a recurring Clinton tactic.            The spot finally shifts toClinton, filmed at the White House in glorious color. The previously ominousmusic is replaced with an uplifting theme. Reaganism is reprised, with areference to a $100 billion tax cut--but the tax cut is Clinton's. This is thefirst time the magic words "tax cut" appear in Tell . The message is thatClinton can make his cuts work while "balancing the budget." We see a workerclocking in while the narrator points to 10 million new jobs and, as the spotcuts to a Kennedyesque Clinton with children, it concludes with the phrase "abetter future."                           Tell is essentiallyabout the past--Clinton's economic success vs. Bush's recession and Gingrich'sCongress. Expect Dole to respond by emphasizing that his 15 percent tax cutsolves the problem not yet addressed by the Clinton recovery: that real wagesfor most workers have stagnated.            With Dole at last in therace and equal to Clinton in campaign dollars, the struggle to define thechoice will peak. Will voters go for the Dole tax cut, the Republicanequivalent of a 15 percent wage increase? Or will they stay with a presidentwho claims to have ended the Bush recession and who offers a lesser tax cut?Framing the election around the desirability of tax cuts is risky business forClinton; since the age of Reagan, the public assumes that the Republicans arethe anti-tax party.                           --Robert Shrum
