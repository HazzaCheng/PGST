                                 Sore Loser            As we all know, GarryKasparov is a Russian chess player. So where did he get this uncanny ability towhine exactly like an American pro athlete after an unexpected drubbing?            "The machine's win has notproved anything. It's not yet ready, in my opinion, to win a big contest."            That'sKasparov, explaining how Deep Blue's resounding victory did not reallyconstitute a "big" win. The rangy, big-shouldered computer prevailed in themost famous man vs. machine chess match in history--3 1/2 points to 2 1/2points--capped by a 19-move butt kicking that inspired one grandmaster toobserve, "Kasparov got wiped off the board." Kasparov reacted by reaching deepinto the sports-clich moan bag, maintaining that he had been cheated by somekind of backdoor playmaking help from the IBM team, that the real GarryKasparov hadn't shown up at the match ("I was not in a fighting mood"), andthat his coaching had been bad ("my biggest mistake was following the advice ofcomputer advisers who recommended I play this way").            What way? Losingly?            In addition, he talked abouthimself in the annoying "third-person jock," whimpered about Deep Blue'ssuperior firepower (news flash, Garry: the other side usuallydemonstrates that when it beats you), and grumbled his way through a trash-talkversion of "wait till next year." "It [had] nothing to do [with] science," hewhined. "It was one zeal to beat Garry Kasparov. And when a big corporationwith unlimited resources would like to do so, there are many ways to achievethe result."            And: "Ipersonally guarantee if the machine plays me again, I would tear it topieces."            As IBM's Chung-Jen Tan, the leader of the DeepBlue team, recognized with his overwrought For the Ages rhetoric ("historicallyfor mankind, this is like landing on the moon"), the match will go down in thepermanent record of human-computer relations. Kasparov made us all lookchurlish, bratty, and just plain bad. We humans deserved a better spokesman atthis epochal point in our ongoing voyage of humility; a half century from now,surly, street-tough androids will routinely start bar brawls over the bitchytone of Kasparov's remarks. Yes, Kasparov had to be the guy on the frontline--after all, he's the best human chess player of all time. Still, he leftmuch to be desired in what Frank Deford would call "the class and gracedepartment."            Howmuch nicer it would have been if Kasparov had accepted his defeat with a fewtactful words like, "You de man!" or, "You de machine!"            If Kasparov does get back onto the board withDeep Blue, he really must get it together deportmentwise. May I suggest that heseek role models in the world of checkers, a supremely challenging game (thereare 500 billion billion possible positions on the checkerboard) that doesn'tget the respect it deserves?            Checkersmasters stared down their Armageddon a few years ago, when a powerful computerprogram named Chinook forged a tie with the second-best checkers player in theworld, Don Lafferty. A weaker version of Chinook had previously lost to thelegendary Marion Tinsley, a retired university math teacher considered thegreatest checkers player of all time, who had to withdraw from a 1994 rematchbecause of the pancreatic cancer that eventually killed him. Lafferty bravelystepped in and duked out a record of 1-1-18. No clear decision.            What really matters, though, is that neitherman resorted to in-your-face woo-woos or bitching, though in this case, sassytalk from the other side probably warranted retaliation. ("The computergets smarter every day," said Professor Jonathan Schaeffer, who led the teamthat programmed Chinook, "and human players like Dr. Tinsley and Lafferty justget older.") Tinsley credited God for his abilities, while Lafferty reacted tothe tie with the same sort of aplomb that, it's safe to say, he would havedisplayed if he'd lost.            "It put a lot of strain onme," he admitted, making Chinook sound not like a machine but like a grizzledcounterpart who deserved respect, even affection. "It's nearly got humancapabilities now. ... But I like this machine. I think humans and computers arecompatible."
