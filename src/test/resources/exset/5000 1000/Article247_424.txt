                                 Brewing Scandal            The White House video revelations lead at the Washington Post , the New York Times ,and USAToday . They are also the lead national story at the Los AngelesTimes and top off the Wall Street Journal 's "World-Wide" news box.            The situation, now reported by everyone, and broken by Time , is thatthis past weekend the White House gave congressional and Department of Justiceinvestigators videotapes of 44 different White House coffees in which potentialor actual campaign contributors met with the president. The tapes could shedlight on a question investigators have been looking into for some time: DidPresident Clinton and/or Vice-President Gore actively solicit contributionsinside the White House? The tapes have already set off a political firestormbecause the Justice Department didn't receive them until Saturday, the dayafter Janet Reno announced she found no evidence that the coffees broke thelaw. Sen. Arlen Specter's remark yesterday on CNN that with the latest flap,the White House "may have crossed the line of obstruction of justice" is quotedby USAT and the WP . The Post points out that such tapeswere ostensibly covered by congressional committee subpoenas going back to lastJanuary, while the WSJ adds that Senate investigators had previouslybeen told that no such tapes existed.                           USAT , the NYT and the LAT each report that one segmentof the tapes appears to show then-DNC Chairman Don Fowler being offered fivechecks by an unidentified attendee. Also drawing wide attention: the onlysegment of the compilation without a sound track is the one in which Clinton isseen meeting with John Huang. "We have a Rose Mary Woods problem here," aninvestigator tells the Post .            The NYT presses the questionable timing of the videos' release a bitmore than the other papers, pointing out that the Senate investigationscommittee was notified about them on Thursday and that White House officialsmet with committee staffers on Friday.            The LAT coffee tapes story has the same basics as everybody else,although unaccountably reporting the non-news that at one coffee PresidentClinton says hi to George Steinbrenner before getting to the potentiallyexplosive Fowler story.            The WP reports that today President Clinton will announce his firstextensive use of the new line-item veto authority to cut funding for 30 to 50military projects worth nearly $300 million from a defense construction bill hesigned last week. The White House claims that these projects were not requestedby the Pentagon, but rather are political pork.            The LAT , WP and NYT all feature front-page storiesabout Israel's botched attempt to kill the head of the political wing of Hamasin Amman, Jordan. All three papers report that Prime Minister Netanyahyu hasbeen gravely damaged politically by the failure both domestically andinternationally. (Of course if the plan were successful, his Israeli criticswould have thought he was a genius.) But the WP also has an excellentnarrative of the mission, right down to a (literally) blow-by-blow account ofthe fist-fight in which the Mossad agents were captured. Also, it's thePost that has a named Israeli source saying it was Netanyahu himself whodirected the assassination plan, and that makes it clear the U.S. was deeplyinvolved in the post-botch negotiations resulting in Israel's surrendering ofthe antidote to the poison they used in the mission and in the release fromprison of the spiritual head of Hamas.            It's a staple of the assassination attempt coverage to call this operationthe worst blunder in Mossad's history. It's odd that none of these storiesmention Lillehammer, which would have to be considered an even worse snafu--asuccessful Israeli assassination of an innocent man.            In case you weren't sure, a "reefer" headline (that is, one referring to aninside story) on the front page of the NYT makes it official: "NewsCycle Speeds Up."
