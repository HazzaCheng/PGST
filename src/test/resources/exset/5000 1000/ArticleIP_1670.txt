                                 Not a Matter of Whether But of When                         As unchecked leads flowedfrom unnamed sources, the TV pundits played judge on Friday, jury on Saturday,but shied away from playing executioner on Sunday morning. Only Juan Williams( Fox News Sunday ) seemed rattled by the pundits' collective vehemence,calling their swarming an "electronic lynching."            OnFriday, the talking heads on PBS reigned somber and sincere. Paul Gigot( NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ) camouflaged his glee by saying that thescandal was now in Monica Lewinsky's hands. Mark Shields ( NewsHour ) wasthe first of many weekend warriors to repeat the stock formula about how thevoters had made this deal with Clinton in 1992: He would curb his sexualdesires while in the White House. If he had violated that deal by having sexwith Lewinsky, Shields recited, the voters would hold him accountable. TheWashington Week in Review (PBS) panel lashed Clinton for returning toform by giving "lawyerly, hair-splitting answers" to straightforward questionswhen what the nation wanted was his outraged denial (Mara Liasson). Meanwhile,Michael Duffy measured the evidence against Clinton and doubted that theindependent counsel could prove obstruction of justice.            By Saturday, the pundits were smelling smoke but decidedthat the press still hadn't "found the fire" (Evan Thomas, InsideWashington ). Charles Krauthammer ( Inside Washington ) sensed anelement of "Greek tragedy" to the story, although he didn't specify whether hewas referring to Oedipus Rex or Antigone . Thomas and Jack Germondfound it easier to cast aspersions on Clinton's partner in ... golf, VernonJordan, than on Clinton himself, demanding to know why the Washington fixerhelped Lewinsky in her job search and to find an attorney. Nina Totenbergjoined Liasson in hollering for the president just to tell the truth.            MortonKondracke ( The McLaughlin Group ) made it official: This crisis, hedeclared, is the biggest to hit Washington "since Watergate." He prophesied ascenario in which President Gore would appoint Dianne Feinstein vice president.Capital Gang ster Al Hunt (CNN) embraced Kondracke's view, predicting a"prolonged impeachment" of Clinton and saying that it was not a matter ofwhether but of when Clinton would be driven out. Sworn Clinton enemy RobertNovak surprised all by turning European statesman on the issue, arguing that apresident shouldn't be impeached because he lied about having sex. (Perhaps heprefers a crippled Clinton to a clean Gore.) Margaret Carlson got off awell-polished line, insisting that "1600 Melrose Place" isn't in the sameneighborhood as Watergate.            The pundits came for Clinton's blood on Sundaymorning, feeding off new allegations unearthed by television reporters: He hadbeen seen "alone" with Lewinsky in the White House movie theater. There were"witnesses" to encounters. Brit Hume ( Fox News Sunday ) repeated CNN'sreport that White House aides were talking about resignation. House JudiciaryCommittee Chairman Henry Hyde appeared on Face the Nation (CBS), LateEdition (CNN), and This Week                With Sam and Cokie (ABC) toadvance the cause of impeachment--by fielding and deflecting questions abouthow his committee would entertain such proceedings against the president. Buteven right-wing pundits like Tony Snow ( Fox News Sunday ) branded talk ofimpeachment irresponsible.            Resignation is anotherthing: Cokie Roberts ( This Week ) framed the question in terms of"survival" of the Clinton presidency. Bill Kristol saw the end coming in amatter of days; George Stephanopoulos blushed at the prospect; and George Will,who kept going on about "moral turpitude" in the White House, seemed moreinterested in having the president crucified for his sins than in having himimpeached. (Will also described the crisis as "military," all but predictingthat next Sunday the pundits would find themselves choosing between Clinton andHussein.) Distancing himself as far from Clinton as he could, Stephanopoulosurged the president to deliver a make-or-break speech from the Oval Office,hold a press conference, and address Congress. Such a presidential Chautauquawould do no good, said Kristol, because Clinton would have to tell the truth,and the truth isn't on his side.            Clinton's misadventure putlesser issues in perspective: The pope's visit to Cuba, the defiant SaddamHussein, the Korea bailout. Even free-lance pundit Dennis Rodman, who wassuspended by the Chicago Bulls for missing a practice, was able to see histroubles through Clinton's lens. Rodman told reporters he was doing fine, "Thepresident is having a bad damn week."                           --JackShafer
