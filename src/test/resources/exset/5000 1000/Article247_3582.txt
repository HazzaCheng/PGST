                                 Long Live Travel Guides                        Andrew, please don't send your guidebooks off to Fresh Kills just yet (didthey overlook this site? Located in Staten Island, it's the largest and mostpoetically named garbage dump in the world). I don't think the Web will makeany of our books extinct, or even slow their evolution into ever-diversifiedspecies. To toss off a clich of my own, the Web is just too unruly. One of themarvelous things about our books is the way they organize a major metropolisand its millions of component parts into a digestible, unintimidating,navigable package. They tell us what to see, where to start, and-this is veryimportant-what to do in case we lose a wallet or rupture an appendix. The Webis host to some excellent travel sites, but you'd have to visit several of themin order to produce a commensurately comprehensive guide. You wouldn't have atable of contents or an index. And you'd have to traipse around with a thicksheaf of computer printouts instead of a slim paperback.            That said, if electronic books ever replace printed ones, travel guidebookswill surely be first among the wired. Our kids will probably hit the road withPalm Pilot XXVIIs stuffed in their backpacks. Instead of buying an actual bookbefore they depart (or hunkering down with 10 of them in the local Barnes &Noble and scribbling down the best of each, as I usually do) they'll simplydownload the latest version of the Lonely Planet Guide to Graceland, which willcontain constantly updated train schedules, hotel prices, and restaurant menus.They'll enjoy the coherence and organization of our guidebooks, but also theaccuracy and timeliness of the Web.            To finish off the book reviews, let me predict that the Access Guides may beout of business by then. Each day I've tested it, my Access Guide has laggedfarther and farther behind the others. Richard Saul Wurman, the informationimpresario who created the series, started off in the telephone book business(click here forhis illustrious bio), and his guides work very much like your local WhitePages. Each site, restaurant, and hotel has its own entry. If you know what youwant to look up and what it's called, you'll be fine. If not, you'll have toread the whole damned book. There's no narrative to tie the entries togetherand little indication that some are more special than others (the Carbide andCarbon Building, a "deco masterpiece," gets the same amount of space as thelocal Eddie Bauer).            Another example: Chicago is graced with a 20-mile belt of parkland along itslakefront. I've been running there each day, and the trails are among the mostscenic and immaculately maintained I've ever seen. The park also featuresbeaches, volleyball and tennis courts, mini golf, and even an outdoor gym witha full set of Nautilus machines, all accessible to the public. In short, thelakefront is one of the city's most defining, enviable, and enjoyablefeatures-like what canals are to Venice or the beach is to Los Angeles. ButAccess consigns it to a short sidebar, titled "Cycling in Chicago," that failsto describe many of the park's offerings, or more important, its central rolein city life. There's no mention of the park in the table of contents or theindex, so unless you happened to read Page 83 in detail, you'd never learnabout it at all.            I disagree with your suggestion that a guidebook contain only endorsements.I want mine to include a few well-chosen pans, to steer me away from theoverrated and the overpriced. Then again, perhaps you're just a more chippertraveler than I am; you seemed to enjoy all your guidebooks equally. Or didyou? I know our dialogue is over, but I still wish I could ask you where you'regoing next and which of these guides you would bring along. From now on, I'llbe traveling with Lonely Planet and Insight. Maybe I'll continue to breezethrough Fodor's, Compass, and Frommer's in airport bookstores. As for Access, Ihope it goes the way of steamer trunks and Pan-Am.            Happy trails to you,Jodi
