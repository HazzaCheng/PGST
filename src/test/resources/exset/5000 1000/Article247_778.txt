                                 Never Mind            The LosAngeles Times and Washington Post lead with the House Judiciary Committee'sabrupt decision Thursday to drop (after only two days) President Clinton's 1996campaign finances from the areas it will consider in its impeachment inquiry.The move is also fronted at the New York Times ,which leads instead with the coordinated decision of Europe's central banks tocut their interest rates. This story is also flagged in the Wall Street Journal front-page news index where the move iscalled the effective birth of the European monetary union (officially, still amonth away), but it's missing from the other majors' fronts. USA Todayleads with word that the unseasonably warm weather much of the country isexperiencing has been bad for seasonal businesses like ski tourism and forwinter-related commodities like heating oil. The Washington Post off-lead adds that the warm spell has hurtNovember retail sales, primarily because shelves are stocked with wintergear.            The LAT explanation of Judiciary's finance plug-pull is a quite baldpolitical one: that there is enough Lewinsky evidence to support going forward.The WP says the move came after the committee's chief counsel read theDOJ fundraising-related memos the committee had just gotten. But the NYTspells this out: the committee honchos think the memos contain no evidence of impeachableoffenses. Of course, there is another reason nobody mentions: while it'slikely that few committee members currently have interns working, er, underthem, almost all of them get off on soft money.                           USAT raises another explanation for not taking on a new area: speed.The paper quotes incoming Speaker Livingston's observation that there will befive more Democrats in the House come January, which could be a decidingdifference, since everyone reports that a House impeachment vote will beextremely close.            The WP and NYT report that draft censure resolutions--somerequiring a fine and/or a public Clinton fess-up--are being much discussed inthe House, especially among moderate Republicans.            Those who think the drive to impeachment is simply Republicanmean-spiritedness, should note that according to the NYT , at a pressbriefing yesterday, when Sen. Trent Lott asked if there were any questions onsomething other than impeachment, "He was met with a chorus of nos fromreporters...."            The NYT reports that the 11-nation European interest cut is a drasticshift in policy, coming just two months after these same central bankersadamantly refused to cut because of fears of inflation. But it's clear now,says the paper, that if anything, some European countries (one example cited:Germany) are on the verge of deflation.            The WSJ "Washington Wire" notes that at this week's impeachmenthearings, the two convicted perjurers who testified were not sworn in.                           WP columnist Charles Krauthammer weighs in against the ever-wideningsearch for what he calls "Holocaust guilt money" in the coffers of now-respectablebusinesses such as banks, insurance companies, and manufacturers, includingAmerican firms like Ford and GM. Krauthammer says this is wrong because thereare so few Holocaust survivors left who will actually benefit fromconfiscation. What will mainly happen, he writes, is that lawyers will get richand bureaucrats will get powerful, and there will be a revival of the Shylockstereotyping of Jews. Krauthammer would draw the line at restitution for actualvictims represented by pro bono lawyers. The pro bono point is probably right,but otherwise Today's Papers disagrees. People will think what they will think,but there's nothing inherently unseemly about seeking to return money from thewrong hands to the right ones. And Krauthammer is wrong if he thinks therestill aren't plenty of right ones--because it's not just the actual survivorsof the Holocaust who were grievously injured by the profiteering banks andother firms. Any person who lost one or both parents to the Nazis is also amongtheir direct victims. As long as WW II's damaged children walk the earth,fighting for them is a just cause.            The NYT "Corrections" box admits that a November 15th "Week inReview" piece about foreign translations of U.S. movie titles contains ninebogus examples--Internet spoofs that got by the reporter. But like many acorrection, this admission is incomplete: the wrong titles are not mentioned.You have to go to Howard Kurtz in the WP to find out, for instance,that "Barb Wire" was erroneously translated by the Times as "DelicateOrbs of Womanhood Bigger Than Your Head Can Hurt You."
