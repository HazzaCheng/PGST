                                 The Lovely Linda            "She can't dance/She can't sing...but she's got to be a part of that popmusic thing." The words of Marshall Crenshaw, who once played John Lennon inBeatlemania , came to mind this afternoon with the news of the death ofLinda McCartney. For most of the 1970s, Linda was one of the most universallyridiculed figures in pop music, her shortcomings as a singer and musician alltoo vivid on Paul's records and, especially, his tours. In the '80s, one waggot his hands on a soundboard tape of Linda's microphone during a performanceof "Hey, Jude," and radio stations put its one flat note into heavy rotation.That, combined with the image of Linda as groupie-in-shutterbug's-clothingconjured up by an infamous piece from the Clay Felker era at the VillageVoice , established Linda as a figure of almost singular unpopularity (the"almost" courtesy of Yoko Ono, who in the public's addled mind, bore the addedstigma of breaking up the Beatles.)            Why this should be, when it wasn't her idea to join Wings in the firstplace, and when by all available evidence she kept Paul McCartney wildlyhappy--and with him raised a flock of spirited children whose achievements arebeginning to come to light? Had she been born 20 years earlier, she would havebeen the decorative spouse who kept the creator satisfied as she gave him astable home; two decades later, she'd have been Baby Spice with a brain,Courtney Love on speaking terms with her biological father, Paula Abdul as aphotographer instead of a choreographer.            Paul now becomes the odds-on favorite for next year's Album of the YearGrammy, but it's worth noting that the Big Moments in his life, John's death inparticular, have not brought out the best in him. For 30 years now, audienceshoped he'd serve up wrenching, emotional music--his version of "Mother" from"Plastic Ono Band"--and it just doesn't seem to be in his nature. All the same,the critical re-assessment of Paul is already upon us, and Linda's death willspeed things along. That assessment will overrate Paul's post-Beatlesoutput--in particular, I'm guessing, the music he makes next, just as Tug ofWar was overrated in the wake of John's murder--and underrate his work inthe Beatles, an explosion of pop craftsmanship without precedence, overshadowedby Lennon's mediagenic personality and subsequent martyrdom. I feel like incouple of months, it'll be safe for me once more to admit that Paul was myfavorite Beatle.                           Bitch, Bitch, Bitch: I've always been grateful to Elizabeth Wurtzelfor teaching me the meaning of the word Schadenfreude . It was a conceptthat came up a lot in the days immediately following Tina Brown's installationas editor at The New Yorker , as many journalists of my acquaintancegleefully counted down the moments until Wurtzel was deposed as pop musiccritic. Her writing since certainly confirms that rock 'n' roll was not herideal subject, but the idea that the value of her provocative thoughts issomehow debased by her candor about her personal life, or by her willingness toappear topless on the cover of her book, is hilarious. In case you missed it:that battle was fought in the '80s, and Madonna won. So get over it... My first(and only) conversation with Wurtzel, during a sort-of job interview, placedher on my short list of Fluff & Folders, right alongside Warren Beatty andDiane Sawyer. Fluff & Folders are people so charming on first meeting thatif one were to ask me, "Can you do my laundry tonight?" my only response wouldbe, "Fluff & fold?"...                           A Magazine About Nothing: There's plenty of buckshot being sprayed atLynn Hirschberg and Vanity Fair in the wake of l'affaireSeinfeld , in which the sitcom icon obtained a pre-publication copy of aVF story being written about him. VF says their investigationindicates the Hirschberg gave Seinfeld the piece herself. Hirschberg denies thecharge. Believe whom you will, but it's Jerry who behaved most caddishly byreading a yet-to- close story about himself, requesting corrections, firing hispublicist, and afterwards--his stated pleasure in the storynotwithstanding--leaving both writer and magazine twisting in the wind publiclyby not taking the blame for wanting to check out the piece in advance. Like hedoesn't know that's against the rules.                           --Chris Connelly
