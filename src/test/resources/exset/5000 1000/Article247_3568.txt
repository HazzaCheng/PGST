                                 W(h)ither the Travel Guide?                        Careful, Jodi-reading your evocative description of the Maxwell StreetMarket, I could sense your inner travel writer clamoring to run free. But theguidebook might be extinct before you have a chance to bring your gifts to thetourist masses. Accurate contact information (Web sites, phone numbers), itseems, is only a stopgap measure in the battle against obsolescence. If you'vegot to get online anyway, what's to stop the reader from eliminating the middleman by using an online content site? Very little, when you're visiting anAmerican metropolis.            Even if the city guide is endangered, I have high hopes for the real wonderof the species, the regional guide. A book that can point you from the busstation to a reliable place to eat and sleep in a remote Indian village, dayafter day, is amazing. And the sympathetic voice of a paperback travelcompanion, even one as chatty as Frommer's, can be quite a balm on those lonelytrain rides when no one else in your compartment speaks your language.            But which guides do I like specifically? I find myself agreeing with theAccess Guide most often. And I love their "celebrity" picks: Frommer's may bethe Cronkite of travel guides, but only Access has Walter himself telling youwhere to nosh on the Upper West Side (Zabar's). Fodor's solidity andunapologetic stodginess warm my heart, but its Compass American book can't makeup in literary savvy what it lacks in maps and practical information. TheLonely Planet earns its keep, particularly with its clear, compact maps. It'salso let me in on some secret, out-of-the-way neighborhoods that other guidesneglect-the borough of Brooklyn, for example.            But without a large, unwieldy fold-out map, the Lonely Planet will likely beoverlooked by the new "tourist chic" elite. I love that the drive fortourist-free fun is coming full circle, pushing hipsters back on the beatenpath. In these retro-crazed times, even the loathed Ugly American is gettinganother chance to be hot. Solitude is all well and good, but no one comes toNew York to get off the beaten path. Besides, tourists are fun-even more likelythan New Yorkers to say something shocking, enlightening, or both. And you mayas well learn to love them. No matter when you visit, it's impossible toseparate the Sistine Chapel or the Statue of Liberty from their attendanttourist hordes, unless you have friends in the Vatican (or on the masthead ofTalk magazine).            You're spot-on, by the way, about the thrill of putting one over on the"experts," as I'm sure any of the regular contributors to                   Slate'sFray wouldhappily tell you. Still, I find your architectural critique unduly harsh. Thequestion of 19 or 14 pages of guidebook coverage is splitting hairs-passing offeither as a comprehensive guide to Loop architecture is sacrilege. Ideally, aguidebook should give you just enough information to get you in the door, andthen suggest a good text on Chicago architecture if you're stillinterested.            But not even recommendations are sacred anymore. Another pet peeve of mineis the blatant self- and cross-promotion that plague these sections. Mostguides contain a list of "recommended" films and books, including travelguides. Brands like Frommer's and Fodor's, who produce multiple New Yorktitles, invariably recommend several or all of their other guides. Credibilityis the bread and butter of a travel guide; why would one sabotage it with suchnaked self-interest? It's corporate "synergy" at its ugliest: Only a sap givesaway an honest opinion when there's a buck to be made passing someone on to acorporate partner.            On a lighter note, do you have any favorite travel writing banalities yet?Given what little I'd seen and heard about New York on TV and in magazines,newspapers, and movies before I came, I expected a bland expanse of people andplaces largely indistinguishable from one other. Imagine my surprise whenCitytripping , a locally produced guide to New York youth culture,informed me that I was entering "a city of contrasts." Access refined this to"a city of dynamic contrasts." Then Fodor's floored me with the revelation thatNew York wasn't a city at all, but a "mosaic of grand contradictions." And you,Jodi? Are you taking care to "rub elbows with locals and tourists alike?" Andwhat percentage of your guidebooks warn you that Chicago, despite its abundantcontrasts, just might be "your kinda town?"
