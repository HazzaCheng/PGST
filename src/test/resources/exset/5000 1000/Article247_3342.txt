                                 One Billion Underserved            The New York Times leadswith the U.S. Treasury's announcement that it would like to take advantage ofprojected budget surpluses by buying back some government bonds before theirmaturity dates. The Los Angeles Times leads with the settlement of differencesamong California's leading water agencies dating back to the '30s about theirindividual rights to water from the Colorado River, but the paper's topnon-local story is the government bond buy-back. Water is also the top localstory at the Washington Post --specifically the Maryland governor'sreaction to the drought there, new regulations that will shut off lawnsprinklers and end unrequested drinking water in restaurants. But the paper'stop non-local story is the Senate's approval of a $7.4 billion emergency aidpackage for farmers, which is a response not only to drought conditions butalso to falling commodities prices. The paper points out that this bill wouldspend more than half of next year's projected budget surplus and comes on theheels of last fall's "one-time" farm fix of $6 billion. USA Todaygoes with the New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling that the Boy Scouts' ouster ofa gay scout leader constituted illegal discrimination. In four previous casesin other states, the paper informs, the high courts sided with the scouts. Theissue is considered ripe for review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The twoTimes front the scout story, while the Post runs it inside.            The basic idea behind the government's buy-back, the NYT explains, is to retire olderhigh-interest debt and then to replace it with newly issued lower-ratesecurities. The plan probably won't take place until next year. The paperpoints out that contrary to the current tax cut/surplus debate, this strategydoes not require congressional approval. Both Times note that it also isa vehicle for reducing the government's reliance on foreign lenders, whocurrently hold 39 percent of U.S. publicly held debt. In addition, they say,reduced government borrowing will also lessen competition with privatecompanies for funds, thereby lowering interest rates. The Wall Street Journal notes that the announcement spurred arally Wednesday in longer-term Treasurys, the supply of which would be reducedif the buy-back happens.            The NYT reports that in a matter of days, India, the fastest growingcountry on the planet, will reach a population of 1 billion. The country'spopulation explosion offers a mixed demographic bag: increased life expectancy(age 63, up from 39 just 50 years ago), a lower fertility rate (from six birthsper woman, down to 3.1 over that same period. But what good is this if thereare so many more women having children?), 500 million illiterates, and 320million abjectly poor people.            The WSJ reports that the war between No. 1 online service AOL and No.1 software manufacturer Microsoft won't stop with the instant messaging tiff:Microsoft's next target is AOL's dial-up business itself, which MS is planningto address by offering low-price or even free access to the Internet. There'sprecedent, notes the Journal : Price-cutting was the strategy thatenabled MS to catch Lotus and Netscape.            The NYT reports that travel agents are really chafing over airlines'discounts for Internet ticket purchases. Travel agents now book about 80percent of airline tickets, but increased Internet purchases are a clearthreat. And since the airlines scrapped the traditional 10 percent agent's feefor a $50 fee per transaction, agent fee rates overall have fallen to 6.3percent.            A top-front-with-picture WP story describes how, yesterday, thenational press distracted Hillary Clinton from her great interest in theJamestown, N.Y., regional economy with still more questions about her commentsin Talk magazine about President Clinton as child abuse victim. Askedwhy she agreed to discuss in an interview such a personal subject, she said,"Well, I'm not going to anymore." The paper notes that the non-media types inthe audience responded to this with applause.            Pollster Andrew Kohut writes in a NYT op-ed that fresh polls showthat Hillary Clinton's Senate prospects are not likely to be helped by anyrevelations regarding her relationship with Bill. Indeed, Kohut says, 74percent of a recent sample say they are tired of all the problems of theClinton administration. He concludes, "For most voters, there are no unansweredquestions about the personal lives of the Clintons."
