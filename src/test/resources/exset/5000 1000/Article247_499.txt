                                 Really Juvenile Reynolds                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with revelations from newly disclosedR.J. Reynolds internal documents that seem to show that the company haspersistently attempted to market cigarettes to teens. This is also the topnational story at the Los Angeles Times . The New York Timesleads with the U.N. Security Council's vote telling Iraq to honor previouspromises to allow U.N. inspectors complete access to suspected weaponssites.            The new tobacco documents (many of them marked "Secret"), released as partof a lawsuit settlement, show a company strategy of attracting teenagersthrough advertising and various youth-oriented promotions such as, according toUSAT , "NASCAR sponsorship," "inner city activities," and "T-shirts andother paraphernalia." And says USAT , the documents show that RJR'sintroduction of "Joe Camel" fits in to this strategy.            The dailies point out that since, in 1994, the then-CEO of RJR testifiedbefore Congress that the company does not market to children, these newdocuments have prompted congressional interest in perjury charges. They alsoreport that former FDA head David Kessler says the new material is "a smokinggun" that shows why Congress shouldn't approve the proposed national tobaccosettlement.            The company responded by repeating its denial of youth targeting and statingthat the documents are being taken out of context, telling the WP , "Ourdocuments reflect the social attitudes of the times in which they werecreated."            The Wall Street Journal , which flags the story in itsfront-page news box, passes along another RJR defense: that one document thatseemed to be suggesting pitching product to 13-year-olds contained atypographical error and was really about 18-year-olds. However, according tothe Post , some documents refer to 12-year-olds.            The WP really goes to town on the RJR story, backing up its lead withtwo more stories inside--one on how the revelations will play politically andthe other a collection of extensive selections from the RJR documents. TheNYT plays the story inside.            The NYT lead passes along a CBS News report that arms inspectors havephotographic evidence of Iraqi biological weapon experiments on human beings.The paper also states that China was wavering on the Security Council action,but was finally brought along by the decision to "deplore" Iraq's behaviorrather than "condemn" it. (No telling how many votes could have been garneredif they'd gone with "not really thrilled.")            The WSJ says that Hallmark Cards is coming out with a sympathy cardfor relatives of those who've committed suicide.            The NYT reports that on educational grounds Georgia Gov. Zell Millerproposed as part of his state budget spending $105,000 to make classical musicavailable to every child born in the state. During his budget address Tuesday,he played a bit of "Ode to Joy," and then asked lawmakers, "Now, don't you feelsmarter already?"            Social scientist James Q. Wilson, in aTimes op-ed piece, makes the following argument for the sanity ofTed Kacszynski: "There is nothing in the [Unabomber] manifesto that looks atall like the work of a madman. The language is clear, precise and calm. Theargument is subtle and carefully developed, lacking anything even faintlyresembling the wild claims or irrational speculation that a lunatic mightproduce." Wilson also observes that besides the Unabomber's manifesto, his"skill in manufacturing bombs and the clever ways in which he concealed hisidentity suggest to me that he was clearly sane." Of course, the legalusefulness of these observations is somewhat dubious, because this attempt toshow that Theodore Kacszynski is fit to stand trial depends on the assumptionthat he is the Unabomber, which in turn requires a trial first, which firstrequires showing that he is fit to stand trial, and so on.            With NBC's deal to retain "ER" at a cost of $13 million an episode gettingfront-page coverage at the NYT , LAT , and the WSJ , maybethe next big domestic policy issue will be controlling television healthcare costs.
