                                 Waging War            The New YorkTimes ' top non-local story is a NYT /CBS News poll showing that the Democratshave a significantly higher approval rating than Republicans on most electionissues. The Los AngelesTimes ' top non-local story is the Senate's 55-44 passage of a $1minimum-wage hike--a bill that has not passed the House and would likely bevetoed by President Clinton for the tax breaks it gives to businesses. (TheNYT reefers this story.) The Washington Post leadswith the revelation that the Army has rated two of its 10 divisionsas unready for war, the first time any division has received such a designationin seven years. This "C-4" rating means that the units in question--based inNew York and Germany--need more soldiers, equipment, and training toparticipate in a regional conflict. The Post says this is partly anappeal for more money. The NYT , which credits the Post ,runs this story inside. USA Today leads with a Y2Kscoop: Nearly 50 percent of local 911 emergency services--such asfire, police, and ambulance corps--are not Y2K compliant. This statistic comesfrom the final report of President Clinton's Year 2000 Conversion Council, tobe released today. The Council also says that 60 percent of health-carefacilities and one-third of schools are unprepared; however, the federalgovernment, the telecom industry, the financial sector, transportationservices, and the oil and gas industries are over 90 percent ready.            The NYT poll finds that the Dems have a greater-than-10-point electoraladvantage on health care, education, and Social Security. (The Republicans leadon military readiness, but this issue holds little weight with voters, the pollfinds.) Moreover, Congressional Democrats have a 7-percent-higher approvalrating than Congressional Republicans; if this holds, the NYT says itwould ensure a Democratic House in 2001. George W. Bush holds a significant butshrinking lead--about 10 points--over both Al Gore and Bill Bradley (thedifference between the two Democrats in a race with Bush was not statisticallysignificant). Bush led Gore by 15 points in October and 17 points in September.Both Democratic candidates have a greater-than-10-point lead over John McCain,however.            The Wall Street Journalreports that 14 Pfizer executives sold 1.2 million sharesof the company in the days leading up to Pfizer's hostile takeover bid forWarner-Lambert. Since the bid was announced last Thursday, Pfizer shares havedropped 9 percent.            A Journal opinion piece describes why there have been so many pharmaceutical mergersrecently. Scientific breakthroughs tend to produce small start-ups firms thatpioneer new methods of research and secure valuable patents. Soon, theestablishment companies realize they need the new research technology andpatents, and the small firms realize they need economies of scale to keepproducing successful drugs. Thus the antibiotic revolution produced a spate ofmergers in the '40s and '50s, breakthroughs in heart and digestive drugsproduced mergers in the '70s, and the genetic revolution is producing mergersin the '90s. Also, the move in Washington to create new prescription coveragefor Medicare recipients threatens to lower drug prices, which in turn pushesfirms to produce newer drugs with higher margins, which requires more researchmoney and new technology.            On the NYT Op-Ed page, Garry Wills arguesthat the true test of a presidential candidate is not temperament or virtue butthe shrewd ability to communicate with a constituency.                           What disqualifies a leader is the kind of flaw that would turn awayfollowers. By that measure, Mr. McCain's anger is not what a pastor wouldencourage for the good of a man's soul, but it makes little difference at allin his ability to attract followers.                        Gore's problem, therefore, is not that he is a "beta" (vice presidents--evenLyndon Johnson--must be) or that he is reserved (so was Lincoln), but thathiring a Dick Morris hanger-on like Naomi Wolf and trying to hide it shows a"stunning lapse in intelligence," a daft inability to perceive what willmobilize and what will alienate the voters.            On the Post opinion page, Michael Kelly asks his colleagues in the media,                           Why does everyone loathe us so? Because, my little preciouses, we are soloathable. ... Reporters like to picture themselves as independent thinkers. Intruth, with the exception of 13-year-old girls, there is no social subspeciesmore slavish to fashion, more terrified of originality and more devoted togroup-think.                         To this, Today's Papers readily, wholeheartedly, and unconditionallyagrees.
