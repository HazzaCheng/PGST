                                 Missing in Action            The WP and NYT lead with the run-up to Thursday's start of the Senateimpeachment trial. The LAT goes with yesterday's air action in the southern"no-fly" zone over Iraq between U.S. and Iraqi fighters. And USAT, whichdevotes its front-page "cover story" to the eve-of-trial situation in theSenate, leads with a survey out today of 213 companies showing that largefirms' health benefit plans will go up about 7 percent this year, far outpacingthe current inflation rate of 1.5 percent and making for the first big risesince the early 90s. The paper says the up-tick is primarily driven by theconsolidation of HMOs, and that it's bad news for employees, who typically paymore than 20 percent of the cost of their coverage. The health cost story runsinside at the WP .            According to the papers, the only thing that's really known about theimpeachment trial proceedings scheduled to start in the Senate on Thursday isthat they're scheduled to start in the Senate on Thursday. Comments made bysenators in breaks from yesterday's continuous palavering suggest that the fasttrack proposal is, in the words of the NYT , "foundering," with a numberof Senate Republicans bucking their leadership to complain that the Housemanagers are entitled to more time to make their case against PresidentClinton. According to the WP , Rep. Henry Hyde, the leader of the Houseimpeachment team, also weighed in with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lottagainst a fast track. A related fault line is whether or not the proceedingsshould include the calling of witnesses. On the one hand, a trial withoutwitnesses seems odd and on the other, there is concern that with a full slateof witnesses, the Senate cannot avoid the rancor just seen in the House. "Wethink that would really become a zoo," Sen. John Kerry tells the Times .Another issue is whether the Senate is constitutionally empowered to considercensure. Things are so confused that Sen. Lott has, according to theLAT , urged citizens to call their senators and express their views, aremarkable statement, says the paper, in light of the public's overwhelmingopposition to impeachment.            According to the LAT lead, yesterday's combat over Iraq representsboth the determination of the U.S. to enforce the "no-fly" zones and of SaddamHussein to flout them. The Iraqis sent up more than a dozen warplanes and theU.S. responded with four fighters firing six missiles. The LAT accountmakes it seem that the U.S. aircraft fired on the Iraqis simply because theywere in the zone, whereas the WP and NYT accounts add that theIraqi planes first illuminated the U.S. aircraft with their fire controlradars, indicating possible imminent missile launch (although no Iraqi missilesactually were). But none of the accounts address the issue this differenceraises: What is the U.S. rule of engagement here? Is the mere presence of Iraqiaircraft in the "no-fly" zone considered justification or is some further moreconventionally understood provocative act required?            Also, for a press that's become quite intoxicated with the technical detailsof our weapons, especially when they work, there's a notable lack ofinformation in the accounts about how each of six U.S. missiles could fail tohit obsolescent Iraqi planes. The NYT quotes the DOD spokesman sayingthat the Iraqi pilots had been able to get out of range of the missiles. Thisis doubtful, if the U.S. missiles were fired within their range envelopes,which is U.S. practice, because missiles are many times faster than airplanes.More likely is that the Iraqi pilots saw the missiles coming and then, probablywith the help of distracting countermeasures, made sudden maneuvers themissiles couldn't duplicate. Another possibility is that the shots were alltaken looking down at the Iraqi planes, with the clutter of the desertbackground confusing the radar-guided missiles. But none of these matters makeit into the reporting. In addition, only the LAT and the WP runthe incident on their fronts. The NYT puts it on page three andUSAT saves it for page nine.            In the past year, the papers have made much of the various safety andenvironmental negatives posed by the wild proliferation of sports utilityvehicles. A front-page WSJ feature adds another to the list. At least in thisweek's blizzard in Chicago, the "off-road" monsters got stuck in the snow likecrazy.            Maureen Dowd makes the case today for President Elizabeth Dole. On theprinciple that we will want our next president to be everything this one isnot, she writes, "After President McMurphy, we will want Nurse Ratched."
