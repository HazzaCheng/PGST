                                 Not So Clean Livingston            The nation's split-screen crisis leads all around--with banner headlinesreferring to both impeachment and Iraq the order of the day. The papers notethat the House impeachment debate begins this morning and presumably a thirdday of military actions will soon follow. So at some point then, there will beat one and the same time charges raining down on Bill Clinton's head and bombsraining down on Saddam Hussein's.            The papers report that in the first two days of the Iraq operation, therewere no U.S. casualties, and that in Baghdad, officials are claiming that atleast 25 Iraqis have died. The coverage also quotes Chairman of the JointChiefs Gen. Henry Shelton's comment that targets successfully hit includedSaddam's Baghdad military headquarters and barracks there housing his securityforces. He is also quoted saying that other strikes were "not as successful."None of the papers note the Pentagon briefing technique on display here: WhileShelton illustrated the successful hits with before and after photos, themisses were not illustrated. It's reported that one of the Baghdad sites struckby cruise missiles was the home of the youngest of Saddam Hussein's threedaughters. The Washington Post quotes an Iraqi official asking if herhouse was one of the key structures for the rule of Iraq. Nobody explainswhether or not the building seems to have been hit intentionally.                           USAToday , the New York Timesand the WP all run President Clinton's forceful response to thesuggestion made previously by senior Republicans that he ordered the airstrikesto distract from the drive to impeachment: "I don't think any serious personwould believe that any president would do such a thing." The papers also note ageneral climb-down among the Republican bigfeet from such suggestions, andindeed, everybody carries Newt Gingrich's remarks on the House floor that "nomatter what our debates at home, we are as a nation prepared to lead theworld."            The NYT front features a story stating that while American andBritish forces have targeted military, intelligence, and communicationsfacilities, they have avoided hitting known Iraqi chemical and biologicalweapons sites in order to avoid unleashing plumes of poisons into the air thatcould kill Iraqi civilians. The paper notes the oddity of this given that oneof the stated aims of the strikes is non-proliferation. A piece on the Los AngelesTimes front offers something of an answer: The Clinton militarystrategy is "containment-plus," the plan to use force whenever needed--not justthis one time--combined with financial incentives to motivate some indigenousIraqi force to rise out of the chaos thus created to topple Saddam.            The papers note some international criticism. The WP says thatRussia's lower house of Parliament passed with only one dissenting vote aresolution saying the U.S. strikes were terrorism. The NYT reports thatat the U.N., Iraq, China and Russia all called for an immediate stop to theraids (using its time-zone-assisted later deadlines, the LAT reportedthis yesterday). The WP says there were protests in Cairo, Beirut andJordan.            Meanwhile, the papers report, Congress yesterday was the site of bitterdebate over whether or not the impeachment debate and vote should proceed whileour forces are fighting overseas. Everybody notes that Bob Livingston, in hisfirst floor speech since being chosen to be the next Speaker, claimed asprecedent the Nixon impeachment hearings, which he claimed went on when"troops, American troops were deployed in the field in Vietnam...." No memberof Congress nor any paper but the NYT caught Livingston's mistake. Butthe Times , befitting its reputation for solid historical reporting,notes that in fact, the last American combat troops left Vietnam seven monthsbefore the House Judiciary Committee got the Nixon case.            Livingston's other big whoops of the day got a lot more attention. Becauseof the imminent release of a Roll Call piece based on a storyHustler is apparently working on indicating that Livingston has hadnumerous affairs during his 33-year marriage, Livingston preemptively fessedup. He suggested that his situation was different from Bill Clinton's becausehis affairs were "not with employees on my staff, and I have never been askedto testify under oath about them." Well, Congressman, just to reassure thenation, you wouldn't mind doing that now, would you?
