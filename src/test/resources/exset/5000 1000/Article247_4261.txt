                                 When Motley Fool Speaks, (Some) People Listen                        The Internet has become such a central part of both the U.S. economy and theAmerican cultural landscape that it's easy to imagine that a real convergencebetween the offline and online worlds has happened, particularly when it comesto the media world. But the truth seems to be that for a lot of the offlinepress, and for much of Wall Street, what happens on the Internet is stilleither something of a mystery or, almost by definition, too sketchy to takeseriously.            Take the case of Celera Genomics, a biotech company that offers informationfrom its genetic databases to drug makers. Since the close of trading on Dec.16, Celera's share price has risen from 76 to 160, or better than 100 percent.The company's trading volume has skyrocketed as well. Just 110,000 sharestraded on the 16 th , while 1.69 million changed hands on the17 th , and the stock has had volume of a million shares or betterevery day since then. (Well, technically, on the 23 rd only 997,000shares traded, but that's pretty close to a million.) The stock leapt 11 pointson the 17 th , 15 points on the 20 th , and 23 points on the21st, fell back a little on the 22 nd , and then bounced further aheadon the next two days.            Even by the standards of this wacky momentum-driven market, that's animpressive and really surprising move, and it did not go unnoticed by eitherthe New York Stock Exchange or, eventually, by the financial press. On Dec. 20,for instance, the NYSE asked Celera itself whether it knew of any reason forthe sudden spike in its stock, and the company said, sensibly enough, that itdid not comment on its stock price. Three days later, the NYSE had to declarean order imbalance at the open because there were too many buy orders and notenough sell orders on the books. And Bloomberg and Reuters both ran pieces onCelera's ascent.            The odd thing, though, is that no one has actually reported what happened.Bloomberg, for instance, blithely attributed the run-up to "increasedenthusiasm for genetic information companies and for incorporating genomicresearch into drug development." As for why that enthusiasm suddenly hitinvestors with such force, and why it was so focused on Celera, all Bloombergcould offer was an article that appeared in the New York Times on Dec.20, which included a one-line reference to Celera. Bloomberg quoted an analystwith Banc Boston Robertson Stephens who confidently said, "The New YorkTimes article would be the trigger today." Reuters, meanwhile, came to thestory yesterday, including Celera in a broader piece about a boom in biotechstocks, a boom that, weirdly enough, it suggested began about 10 days ago, onthe 17 th .            What everyone appears to have missed is that on the evening of Dec. 16, theMotley Fool, an onlineinvestment community with more than 2 million unique visitors a month (and myformer employer), announced that it would be adding Celera to its "Rule-BreakerPortfolio" in the next five days. (The Fools announce all their buys in advanceof actually making the purchase in order not to front-run the stock.) The verynext day, Friday, volume in Celera was 15 times higher than it had been onThursday, and the stock's dramatic rise was under way. It's probably true thatall the stock's rise can't be attributed to the Fool's influence, especiallysince Celera did announce an important acquisition on Dec. 23. But it's alsotrue that many more investors are now paying attention to Celera than werebefore the Rule-Breaker buy, and that now includes lots of people who havenever even visited the Fool site.            Whether you think this is a good thing or a bad thing probably depends onwhat you think of the Internet's impact on financial markets. I think a goodargument can be made that in this case, what you're looking at is not aspeculative bubble but rather an example of potentially valuableinformation--not the Rule-Breaker Portfolio's decision to buy, but itsexplanation of why it was buying--being disseminated to a much wider audiencethan would once have had access to it. But the really interesting thing is thealmost complete obliviousness of the offline media to what actually happened,and the forced nature of their explanations for Celera's rise. You didn't evento have to work hard to find out about the addition of Celera to the portfolio,since the Fool put out a news release announcing it. Call it willful blindness,then. Apparently the Net still has a ways to go before the offline press canreally take it seriously.
