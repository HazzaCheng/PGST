                                 Impeach Pits            The LosAngeles Times and USA Today lead with a court-ordered scientificpanel's finding of no credible evidence that silicone breast implants causedisease, a story that also makes the New York Timesfront, but runs inside at the Washington Post . The WP goes with the HouseJudiciary Committee's ever-increasing hardening of partisan lines concerningimpeachment. And the NYT leads with the Exxon/Mobil deal announcedyesterday, which would create the world's largest company. There is so muchuncertainty about whether the $80 billion deal will get government approval,that, the Times observes, both companies' stock prices dipped on thenews. Columnist Alexander Cockburn warns in the LAT of one thing thatwill in his opinion definitely go up if the deal flies: gas prices.USAT 's inside package on the merger says in the short-term prices willgo down, but the experts quoted are less sure about the long-term.            The implant leads point out that the panel's findings could make it muchharder in the future for women to convince juries that their silicones gavethem arthritis, lupus, or immune system and/or connective tissue problems. BothUSAT and the LAT note that the panel did not address the healthconsequences of ruptured implants, nor, adds USAT , problems of infectionor painful breast hardening. The LAT says that the findings fit withother recent scientific results. The paper mentions in its second paragraphthat three of the four scientists on the panel are women, while USATsaves this information for the last paragraph. And the LAT surpriseswith word that the panel members are barred from speaking to the media. Still?Why? How is this possible?            The Post lead says the committee Republicans won a vote allowingpursuit of alleged Clinton fundraising abuses, and the White House isconsidering not presenting any defense whatsoever to any areas the committeehas raised--because, in the words quoted from presidential spokesman JoeLockhart, the HJC has been "hijacked by extremists." Dick Gephardt, says thepaper, deemed the committee's investigation "in chaos" and asked Newt Gingrichto take charge, which Gingrich apparently will not do. The NYT editorialpage, which has been tough on Clinton lo these many months, agrees withGephardt, in an editorial titled "Out of Control." The Wall Street Journal editorial page gets off a good linefrom the other direction, saying that the Democrats' increasing intransigencegiven their reading of public sentiment shows that "polls are the crack cocaineof politics."            While the WP focuses on all the political carping, it barely mentionsthat yesterday's Judiciary hearing was largely given over to the testimony ofconvicted perjurers, legal experts and several retired military officers, alldiscoursing on the nature and significance of perjury. By contrast, theNYT , in its front-page story, is quite taken with the two perjurers, anex-basketball coach and a doctor, both of whom had been found guilty of lyingabout sex. (But how galling it must be for witness Alan Dershowitz that neitherthe Post nor the Times mentions his name.)            In his WP column, Michael Kelly doles out some important context tothe recent news that an international aid effort has produced $3 billion in pledges of aid for the Palestinian Authority:the London Sunday Times recently reported that the PA once diverted $20million earmarked for low-cost housing to luxury flats for Yasser Arafat'selite instead, and moreover, that the PA's own auditors found last year thatnearly 40 percent of the annual budget of $323 million was wasted, looted ormisused.            An inside story at the NYT reports on the novel fundraising projectundertaken by a fourth-grade class in a Denver suburb. They have used the$35,000 they have raised so far to free 601 people from chattel slavery inSudan. Send your generous donations to Highline Community School in Aurora,Colorado.
