                                 Ruff Treatment            Everybody leads with the release last night by the House JudiciaryRepublican majority of four proposed articles of impeachment, to be voted on bythe committee come Friday or Saturday. The articles charge President Clintonwith four offenses: 1) Perjury before a grand jury; 2) Perjury in a civil casedeposition; 3) Obstruction of justice; and 4) Abuse of power.            The NYT and WP quote White House spokesman Joe Lockhart's reaction thatthere's "nothing in the allegations...that brings anything here up to thestandard of an impeachable offense." The LAT quotes Jim Kennedy of the WhiteHouse counsel's office saying almost the exact same thing, although Kennedyadded the quintessential spontaneity-hating Washington complaint: the no-noticerelease was unfair. The coverage adds that Judiciary Democrats responded bytendering a censure proposal, calling for a condemnation of Clinton that hewould acknowledge by signing. And the papers report that Henry Hyde will allowit to be brought to a committee vote. The NYT and Post note thatyesterday, for the first time, the White House aggressively embraced censure.Both papers explain that the Democratic anti-impeachment strategy is to pushfor a full House censure vote, in the hope that this will siphon some keymoderate Republican votes away from any impeachment bill.                           USAT and the WP report that today, Judiciary's Republicancounsel will probably present the videotape of Clinton's Jones case deposition.The Post explains why: because Clinton has claimed that he wasn'tlistening when his lawyer Robert S. Bennett denied that Clinton had engaged inany kind of sexual activity with Monica Lewinsky, and the Republicans believethe video clearly shows Clinton paying close attention.            Before the advent of the impeachment articles, the committee was busyhearing the second day of Clinton defenders. White House counsel Charles Ruffdid the heavy lifting. USAT and the LAT note that for the firsttime, via his testimony, the White House promised that Bill Clinton would notpardon himself or accept a pardon from his predecessor. The LAT andWP give the most space to Ruff's tortured attempts to show thatClinton's sworn denials of sexual relations with Lewinsky were not perjury. TheLAT reports that at one point Ruff argued that while Clinton misledabout this, he did not commit perjury because he did not intend not to tell thetruth. But if he misled, then didn't he intend to have his auditors end upbelieving a falsehood? And isn't that just as injurious to the legal system asperjury? If arranging to have someone killed is as bad as killing them, whyisn't arranging to have someone believe what's false as bad as lying tothem?            In the same week that USAT revealed that management guru StephenCovey's own company is floundering, now comes the WSJ with a front-page featuredetailing how Wyncom, Inc., a firm that brokers the personal appearances of thelikes of Covey and Tom Peters, is in financial trouble. Recent Wyncom flops:Spending weeks and losing half a million dollars getting just 5,250 people intoDenver's big basketball arena to hear Tom Peters, and losing $700,000 when only2,700 folks showed up at the Georgia Dome to hear Covey and Colin Powell.                           USAT 's front reports on a bit of unintended technology first revealedin the British publication The New Scientist : The Palm III pocketorganizer can intercept the signal used to open an infra-red car lock, the typefound on Mercedes and Chryslers. The stolen code, explains the paper, couldonly be used once and can only open the car, not start it.            It's thrilling to have so many smart readers. In response to yesterday'sconcern in this space that the Supreme Court decision banning probablecauseless car searches after routine traffic stops would prevent arrests likethe one that snared Timothy McVeigh, Today's Papers received manywell-researched and well-reasoned letters. The point expressed by most of themwas that McVeigh was in fact arrested for gun possession after a search basedon probable cause--namely the cop thought he saw a gun bulge on him. Fairenough, but the whole matter gets one to thinking: if probable cause is soessential to a legal search, then how come those X-ray machines and metaldetectors you have to go through at the airport are legal? They're not justapplied to suspicious passengers. Why should travel by plane subject you tosearches travel by car does not?
