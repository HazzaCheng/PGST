                                 The Conformists                        Dear Chris,            A Beatles biographer, I forget which one, once said that Sgt. Pepper"brought the world closer together than any event since the Congress ofVienna." Whatever that means. Maybe "monoculture" is too strong a wordfor this way of thinking, maybe not. But you've certainly hit on something byfocusing on Miller's partiality to music that "brings us all together." He's ane pluribus unum man.            Miller quotes Ed Kelly, one of the interchangeable dancers on Dick Clark'sAmerican Bandstand , as saying: "The craziest part of it was that many ofus became these instant celebrities, yet none of us really had any talent."There is an implicit criticism here of rock's role in creating today'sproblematic (to put it mildly) celebrity culture.            But Miller is not awfully concerned about authenticity. For him, rock is                           the product of the coldest sort of commercial calculation, true,but also embodying a not ignoble vision, of an America transformed, of Mind andBody, Black and White, dancing the same dance, moving to the same beat, askids, en masse, joined in their own brand of Dionysian revelry, watered downand trite, but genuinely uplifting all the same.                        But this is ignoble. This is where rock turns into thefeed-bag-for-morons, the opiate of the masses, that its harshest critics havealways condemned. Once rulers understand the political implications ofDionysian revelry, it gets turned to rotten ends. Merengue is terrific music,too, but when, half a century ago, Trujillo ordered that sound systems be setup to play it all over the Dominican Republic, it wasn't to "uplift" people butto render them passive.            Rock has its roots in the Cold War; it is, at least in part, the musicalexpression of outrage at the uniformity and boredom of American suburbia. Butlike so many protest movements, it partakes of the very vices it purports tocritique. Rock--at least the canonical line of it that Miller describeshere--has been a greater force for unthinking conformism than anythingLevittown wrought.            Kids understand this. Miller doesn't always. That's why he gets blindsidedby punk and disco. The Sex Pistols, of course, are incomprehensible without aglance at the two-track uniformity of mid-to-late 1970s music: lugubrious,11-minute-long navel-gazing guitar dirges by the Eagles and Jackson Browne onone hand; ad jingles like "Undercover Angel" and "Heartbeat--It's a Love Beat"on the other. Not that there weren't a few truly emetic songs that united thevices of both: Gerry Rafferty's "Baker Street," Walter Egan's (was that hisname?) "Magnet and Steel."            But what is disco? Since I know little about it, and since you make bigclaims for it, I would love to hear more. At the time, it seemed like a bid by"out" classes--both urban blacks and the last of urban working class whites--topartake of the license and self-expression that rock had provided to privilegedclasses. Since disco came precisely at a time when the privileged classes, intheir political incarnation, were busily pitting working-class whites againstblacks through such innovations as forced busing, this seems like an oddalliance, to say the least. Unless the white participation in--and enthusiasmfor--disco was a mirage. But it didn't seem like it at the time.            Maybe you're right that Miller is not listening to much modern rock. I don'tlisten to much, either, and most of it's poppy stuff I hear on the drive towork. I too, find a lot of what's come out of the 1990s derivative. SherylCrow's guitar licks seem so familiar that I have often suspected they're simplymixed out of "Stuck in the Middle With You." Smashmouth makes me certain that,while Jim Morrison may be dead, Ray Manzarek is not. The New Radicals soundlike Todd Rundgren has just emerged from the cryogenics lab where he's lainfrozen since 1972. Beck, whom I find a consistent delight, seems to draw fromless mainstream stuff--a hybrid of Prince and that terrific high-tech Britishduo Godley Creme (who had a pop incarnation as 10cc).            I'm sure these are fogeyish and undiscriminating sentiments. My point isthat any casual acquaintance is bound to lead to similar ones, because thesurface of rock is exciting only at rare and lucky moments.            Best,Chris
