                                 Journalistic Integrity, and Other Oxymorons                        I'll do you one better: Let's pose as guidebook writers, and get someoneelse to pick up the tab for our visit to Niagara. I'll impersonate the LonelyPlanet writer, and recommend seeing the Falls the "authentic way," bybarrel.            It's true that listening to a guidebook's cheerleading gets tiresome. But atravel guide full of panned restaurants is useless. If a book doesn't like aplace, they shouldn't list it. The exception, of course, is in small towns orisolated locales (e.g., Liberty Island) where a forgettable restaurant or hotelmight be the only option. Another factor that discourages negative reviews isthe risk of a libel suit.            The real problem is that none of the guides sift through all the stuff andtell you what's right for whom. Even in a general guidebook there's room forspecialization: the best green spots, the best museums and galleries, etc.Fodor's has suggested itineraries, Access and Frommer's have rating systems,but it still seems that you've got to read the entire book to make sure you'renot missing something that you'd enjoy, and that can be wearisome no matter howwell they're written.            When I worked for Let's Go, editors cobbled together a list of restaurants,hostels, and hotels and sent them complimentary service vouchers, which theywould sign and return. Researchers could then visit the establishmentsanonymously, and present the voucher when the bill arrived. This method doesprevent preferential treatment, but I do think that a free lunch can compromiseyour review whether your employer or the restaurant pays--footing the bill isan integral part of the dining experience, and it's harder, if only slightly,to rate the value of a meal someone else buys. In general, though, I've foundtravel writers to be honorable folk. And even the unscrupulous are moreinterested in eating for free in restaurants they have no intention of listingthan in taking kickbacks from low-quality establishments in exchange forinclusion. One way or another, the interests of the readership are served.            It's wrong to say that these guides don't take reader feedback into account.Lonely Planet (and Let's Go) usually acknowledge the readers who wrote themhelpful letters in the back pages of the book. This feature is strangely absentfrom my New York Lonely Planet, but the most recent edition of LP's India bookhas four pages of readers' names. Zagat's may be good for finding a culinarysure thing, but you'll have to stand on line with the rest of New York (or inline with the rest of Chicago). And I think it's nave to use their ratings asan absolute measure of restaurant quality. Locals have different interests,attitudes, and palates than tourists, and would be accordingly harsher on themerestaurants. And before taking Fodor's to task for praising Michael Jordan'schops, admit it: You've got to look pretty hard to find a bad steak inChicago.            As for theme restaurants in general, they're merely indicative of the factthat a lot of people travel with their children. The theme restaurant, as apacifier, is a stroke of genius. The overdone dcor gives the short ofattention plenty to gawk at. The food is bland enough for even the most finickyadolescent palate. And celebrity sponsorship is a behavioral modificationtechnique rivaling Santa Claus: Kids shape up quick if you can con them intothinking that Michael Jordan or Sly Stallone might show up at any minute.Mediocre food at inflated prices is (I imagine) a small price to pay for therespite these restaurants provide for the harried parent, and guidebook writersfeel duty-bound to include them. All the same, Lonely Planet gets extra creditfor noting that the Harley-Davidson Caf is "so commercial the menu's availablefor sale at $10."            Having spent so much time defending my former colleagues, I'm afraid I'veleft you little new to work with. I'd still like an explanation: Why areFrommer's New York titles multiplying, when the Web should be pushing them intoextinction?            Jodi, I doubt that I've done much to advance the science of travel guidewriting, but I've thoroughly enjoyed our discussion. Rumor has it that WalterCronkite is opening his own theme restaurant on West 57th Street.We'll toast your safe return to New York with a "Sloe gin (That's the way it)fizz" (complimentary, I hope).
