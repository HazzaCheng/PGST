                                 Mo' beta SLATE.                           Mo' BetaSlate                        Slate proudly announcesSlate Explorer, a new way to navigate through the delights of slate.com. (Sowhy didn't we name it Slate Navigator ? We dunno. Explorer just seemedmore euphonious, somehow.) We think it's pretty darn cool (a technicalsoftware industry term, used to imply strong feelings of affirmation), and hopeyou will as well. (Click here for instructions on how to download SlateExplorer.)            And what is Slate Explorer?It's a poem, an ice cream cone on a hot summer day, the smell of Styrofoam whenyou crack open that box containing your new computer. It's ... well, it's asmall program, actually, that puts a small box on your Windows desktop. (Sorry,it doesn't work on Macs. Yes, we know, we know. ... But to be fair, it doesn'twork on Windows 3.1 either. It does work on Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0.)Click on the little arrow, and the box expands horizontally into a list ofSlate's major categories (Briefing, Columns & Features, Back of the Book,Dispatches & Dialogues, Utilities). Click on a category, and it expandsvertically into a list of current contents. Click on one of these listings, andthe article will appear.            Slate Explorer works, inmost cases, even when you're not online. When you select an article, theprogram will launch your browser and initiate a Web connection. When you areonline, Slate Explorer will automatically update itself, even if--for someinexplicable reason--you're not reading Slate at the moment. It's all a bithard to explain, but fun to try.            Now, listen carefully. Thisis a beta release of Slate Explorer. "Beta" is a software industry termfor a product that is perhaps just a teensy bit short of absolute perfection,but is being released anyway because we just can't wait anymore--or rather,because we want to let the software-using community share in the excitement offinding any last-minute bugs. We're reasonably sure that Slate Explorer won'tcause your computer to explode, or to charge large sums to your Visa card, orto take up smoking, or to insult a police officer. But we make noguarantees.            For themoment, this beta release is only being promoted in Readme--that is, to ourmost loyal and discerning readers (who are also immune to crass flattery). Ifyou do happen to discover a flaw in Slate Explorer, just keep it to yourself,OK? No, please e-mail us about it at help@slate.com. But be polite. Remember: This is a beta.                           10,000Pennies for Your Thoughts                        How wouldyou like to get paid to do something you do all the time anyway for zippo?

Traditional Values                        Most of Slate will not bepublished next week, the third and last of our traditional summer weeks off.(Or at least, we hope to make this a tradition, and have got away with it fortwo summers so far.) We will, of course, be hard at work throughout the weekfor the betterment of Slate, the Microsoft Corp., and the world, in roughlythat order. Or at least, we'll be thinking occasionally about the betterment ofthese fine institutions. And Scott Shuger will be posting "Today's Papers"early every morning as usual, except for Sunday and Labor Day. Slate willreturn to its normal schedule Monday, Sept. 8.                           --Michael Kinsley
