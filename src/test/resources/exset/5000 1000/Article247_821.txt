                                 Barr Exam            The New York Times ,LosAngeles Times and Washington Post each lead with the initial brief filings inthe impeachment trial. The Wall Street Journal flags the story in its front page newsbox. The headlines at the two Times and the Journal stress theoffering by President Clinton of his defense, while the Post big typeexplains that the paperwork dumped on the Senate includes arguments from bothsides. USAToday runs its Clinton defense story as the off-lead and goes insteadwith Michael Jordan's imminent retirement, a story that rates big front play atthe NYT and a reefer at the LAT . Another sports story dominatesmuch of the rest of the USAT front: the wildly accelerating pricessports franchises are fetching. For the price--$800 million--that theWashington Redskins brought over the weekend, you could, notes the paper, buy aspace shuttle flight, or Avis or Rolls-Royce.            The upshot of the White House filing is that the charges do not rise to thelevel of "high crimes and misdemeanors," while the thrust of the Housemanagers' brief is that if President Clinton's transgressions aren'timpeachable, then no president not a convicted felon or murderer need ever fearimpeachment in the future. It's noted all around that the White House has addeda more aggressive wrinkle to its posture: now claiming that it's a "myth" thatClinton did not tell the grand jury the truth about his relationship withMonica Lewinsky. Dissembling about that relationship was confined to the PaulaJones trial deposition, which as it happens, is no longer an issue because thearticle of impeachment concerning it was not passed.            Everybody notes that with the impeachment trial set to start Thursday,President Clinton eschewed the usual joint press conference alongside visitingArgentine President Carlos Menem. And both the NYT and WP notethat the congressional wood shop has been busy building new tables especiallyfor the trial. The Post says its latest poll indicates 85 percent ofthose surveyed said they had definitely made up their minds about the case,which, the paper says, is "good news for Clinton."            The coverage emphasizes that the White House chose at this time not to filemotions challenging the proceedings, motions that could have added weeks to thewhole process. But the papers also report that the White House has indicated itwill probably file such motions if the Senate chooses to allow the calling ofwitnesses after the initial presentations by the House managers and the WhiteHouse defense counsel. The Post notes that the White House has alsodropped for now plans for any constitutional challenges such as that thearticles of impeachment were passed by a lame-duck House. But, the paper adds,Sen. Tom Harkin and Sen. Paul Wellstone have filed a procedural motion thatwould open the Senate's closed door for deliberations on trial motions or thefinal verdict.            The LAT reports that at a Monday night press conference, Larry Flyntaccused Rep. Bob Barr, one of the House impeachment managers, of hypocrisy forrefusing to answer questions put to him about a relationship with a woman notthen his wife (she is now) during divorce proceedings.            Inside pieces at the WP and NYT report that Clinton nationalsecurity officials including Madeleine Albright and the director of the CIAhave recommended that Clinton deny clemency to convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.The official word is that Clinton hasn't come to a decision yet, though. Thestories don't mention whether or not Albright and company were influenced by ormentioned to the president this week's New Yorker story by Seymour Hersharguing that Pollard's intelligence take made its way to the Soviet Union.            The WP 's "The Reliable Source" reports that David Duke now has anopponent in the race to fill Bob Livingston's soon-to-be-vacated congressionalseat: it's--and this is really her name--Monica Monica.            The NYT op-ed page contains a rumination about the imminence of themillennium by Alain de Botton that scans with the familiarity of an old shoe.But wait a second, it is an old shoe! The piece is merely a lift of two pagesfrom de Botton's two-year-old book How Proust Can Change Your Life witha 1999 tack-on. Talk about Remembrances of Things Past! Shouldn't the stuff inthe newspaper be...new?
