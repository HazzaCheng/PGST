Exley is a cybersquatter who demanded $20K from the Bushcampaign for the rights to the domain name. When they refused, he set up ananti-Bush site. The guy even claims to be non-partisan. This is just a case ofelectronic blackmail that the media blowhards want to turn into a free-speechcase.            (To respond, clickhere.)                           SUBJECT:G.W.

As I'm sure y'allknow, the Bush campaign purposely combatted the possibility of competing withmock spoof sites like gwbush.com by BUYING domain names (over 60 sites, from what I gotfrom the Newsweek article). Some examples (and go ahead and try them):www.georgebushbites.com, www.georgebushblows.com, georgebushsucks.com,www.bushbites.com, www.bushsux.com. All these sites willautomatically lead into George Dubbawya's Web site (www.georgewbush.com). Neat, huh?            GWBush.com and another Zack Exley site squeaked bythis, and since the campaign couldn't buy it, they decided to get rid of it.Funny, I thought that politics and campaigning were about freedom of speech andthe ability to compete. The Bush campaign has a sweet monopoly on that.            If you would like more information, you should goto the site that is actually handling this case: www.rtmark.com. It has everything from the ceaseand desist letter to any articles remote to the subject.            (To respond, clickhere .)

The impact of the Web on the campaign is a worthytopic, but a little more objectivity, please.            (To respond, clickhere.)

Access to weather information on the Web is a giantleap forward in weather media because it allows one to avoid the hype andhysteria with which the general news media covers extreme weather. Check outwww.wunderground.com. Theinformation is straightforward, but interestingly displayed. I could trackFloyd, read Weather Service bulletins, and follow satellite images withouthaving to suffer through moronic anchor-blondes screaming into microphones overthe sound of the wind. Weather sites on the Web eliminate the media middleman,and isn't that the point?            (To respond, clickhere.)
