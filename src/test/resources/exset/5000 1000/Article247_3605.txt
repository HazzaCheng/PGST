                                 Investors Have No Business in Show Business                        One of the bad things about a bull market is that the performance ofmediocre stocks can look great when presented in isolation. Combine that factwith the willful neglect of the idea of the opportunity cost of investing--thatis, you have to measure the success of an investment against other potentialinvestments you might have made, not against "zero"--and you get a recipe forreal confusion.            Take the very curious column by Roger Smith, Variety's financialcolumnist, in the most recent issue of that magazine. In essence, Smith arguesthat entertainment has been a great business to be in over the last 15 years,that entertainment stocks have been often undervalued, and that they've beenundervalued for one real reason: Wall Street is jealous of Hollywood, becausepeople in Hollywood make lots of money and have fun doing it.            There are a lot of strange ideas packed into that argument. First, itassumes that Wall Street somehow controls stock prices. In the long term, itdoesn't. Markets collectively set prices, and markets are much bigger, andsmarter, than all the investment banks and brokerage houses in the world puttogether. If the market has looked skeptically on entertainment stocks, it'sprobably for a very good reason. And even if Wall Street did set prices, theidea that investment bankers have consistently foregone potential fortunes forthemselves and their clients because their jealousy of Hollywood made themunwilling to buy or even recommend entertainment stocks is, at best,implausible. This is capitalism, remember? People who walk away from $20 billsthat are lying on the street eventually disappear.            But there's also a deeper problem here, which is that entertainmentcompanies have not, in fact, been those proverbial free $20 bills. Smith pointsout that "the revenue side of showbiz" has risen dramatically at home andphenomenally abroad over the past decade and a half. But he doesn't sayanything about the profitability of showbiz as an industry, let alone about itsreturn on invested capital (the most important single metric of a company'seconomic performance). That's because compared to industries such as software,telecom, networking, and pharmaceuticals, the performance of the entertainmentindustry has been anemic.            Besides, haven't entertainment stocks been mediocre? Well, Smith mentionsthat Wall Street analysts often cite this point as justification for what hecalls their "long-range myopia." But then he shows--or believes he shows--thatin fact big entertainment stocks have done very well in the past 15 years.Four--Disney, Comcast, Cablevision, and TCI--are up 20-fold, two are up betterthan 10-fold, a couple are up seven-fold, and a couple have "onlyquadrupled."            Now, set aside the fact that of the real powerhouses, three are cablecompanies that own hard assets, not part of what we usually think of as"Hollywood." Consider instead that since 1984, the S&P 500 Index is upbetter than nine-fold (and better than 12-fold since 1982). So most of thestocks that Smith cites have done about as well as or worse than the market asa whole. Then recognize that Smith is talking about the very best of the besthere, and you start to see how weak the industry as a whole has been.            Twenty-fold since 1984? Between 1993 and 1998 alone, Dell's stock rose100-fold, AOL's rose 35-fold, and Microsoft was up 12 times. Cisco, SunMicrosystems, EMC, Pfizer, Merck, MCI/Worldcom, Coke, Gillette, Wal-Mart, HomeDepot, McDonald's, even recent laggards like Nike: All of these stocks did aswell as or significantly better than the best entertainment companies over thepast 15 years (and many of them have been public for a significantly shorterperiod of time).            It's not that entertainment isn't a better business than it used to be. Itis, mainly because the people running these companies are spending more timerunning them and less time thinking about how to make them bigger. But by theonly standard that really matters--comparing how much money is put into acompany versus how much money that company makes--entertainment is just not,and never has been, a good business. There are exceptions--Disney, Time Warner,CBS, USA Networks, TCI--but they are the exceptions. The bull market makes iteasy to obscure that fact. But even in a bull market, the real numbers don'tlie. Of course, Smith is surely right that business in Hollywood is a lot offun. Spending other people's money always is.
