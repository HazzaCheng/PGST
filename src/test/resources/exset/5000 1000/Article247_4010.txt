                                 New Age in China?                        Dear Todd:            The way you describe your life is starting to sound glamorous to me. Wedon't even have 24-hour waffle places out here. If we want waffles, we haveabout a 12-hour window of opportunity, and after that, tough luck, you're onyour own.            I have never been to Madison, Wis., but this day-and-night access to wafflesmay be all the reason I need to start planning a trip. The last time I visitedyour general part of the country, I learned a different but equally interestingregional dietary lesson: Apparently, restaurants around there do not feel thata salad is really a salad unless it has first been deep fried and then soakedin a heavy cream sauce. I went to one "salad bar" where not only did I not seeanything that reminded me of a vegetable (and by the way, I'm intentionallygoing to skip the reflexive but pointlessly callous joke I could make about thecustomers, who I'm sure upon closer examination were lovely and admirablepeople), but among the "salad ingredients" being offered was a dish ofchocolate pudding. I thought to myself, "God bless the dietician behind thismenu who deserves a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize just for gettingchocolate pudding reclassified as a salad."            I guess you must be relieved that our friend Moesha has rehydrated and hershow is back in production in time for it to be considered as a possible exportto China under the new Trade Pact. I wonder what the first Chinese products tohit our stores will be? If things work the way they usually do in commerce,when they find out our stores are already glutted with Chinese frozen food, myguess is that they will begin to make and export enchiladas. According to theNew York Times , the president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, "said it was'disgustingly hypocritical' of the administration to claim to be keeping theinterests of working people in mind as it negotiates with a regime thatroutinely violates human rights." Which got me to thinking about how theChinese government continues to arrest and jail members of a religiousgroup/sect/cult called Falun Gong, which, from what I understand, sounds likekind of a cross between tai chi, yoga, and the kind of New Age philosophy aboutcontrolling your body's energy centers that would make it not only a belovedspiritual staple but also a marketing bonanza at least in Los Angeles (andeventually the rest of the country). Maybe when they realize that their socialirritants might well be their most profitable exports, it will be the kick inthe butt the Chinese government will need to start respecting the rights of itscitizens.            On the furious-with-rage front, how about that creepy anti-abortiondunderhead Christopher H. Smith keeping us from paying our U.N. dues becausepart of the money supports women's health organizations that have pro-abortionties? It's good of him to be putting energy into making sure that the unwantedchildren of the future will be born into to a world without a functioningUnited Nations.            And while I'm in the anger section of today's events, I loved Donald Trump'scomments as he campaigns in Miami. The New York Daily news quotes Trumpas having looked the other candidates over and come up with this incisivestatement: "Let me ask you, did they make billions of dollars in a very shorttime? I don't think so." Since that is his criterion for excellence ingovernment, I hope he will remember to review the rsums of drug dealers,lotto winners, sitcom stars, and successful contestants from Who Wants To Bea Millionaire? when he is picking out his cabinet. I also love the way hebrings his girlfriend to press conferences to dress things up. I hope in thefuture he will also bring a blowup of his bank statement and a wheelbarrow fullof cash and precious gems.            Now I am on to reading about string theory.            Love,Merrill
