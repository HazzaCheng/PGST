                                 The '80s: The Decade That Wouldn't End                        Of course I know you know that designs on plates with chocolate syrup arevery late '80s. And the fact, as you note, that they haven't gone away supportsanother of my theories--that the '80s themselves haven't gone away either. Justas 1960-63 was the end of the '50s, and 1970-73 was the end of the '60s, we arenow a record-breaking 17 years into the present decade, culturally speaking.These may be the end of the '80s we're now living through, but I would arguethat the '90s as a culturally distinct decade (the Internet aside) does notexist.            Cornish game hens, drizzled chocolate syrup, friends sleeping with friends'husbands--food plus adultery! I am honored to be the vessel for such athrilling outburst of classic Ephronism. So ... How come this leitmotif informsyour fiction and now your public e-mails, but not your movies (except the onebased on your novel)? On the other hand, I guess You've Got Mailinvolved quasi-adultery, and it did have the great Hanks-scooping-up-the-caviarscene. And Mixed Nuts had a food title.            I like Mark Green. I've donated money to Mark Green. Even though I guesshe's a notch or two to my left, I'd vote for him happily against Hillary orRudy for practically any office--because he has a sense of humor and seems likea vital, mentally healthy person of strong character. So don't make me out tobe some kind of right-winger just because I voted for Giuliani and never muchliked Bill Clinton and don't live on the Upper West Side.            Back to hurricane readiness before I sign off for the day. (Civil defense!Yet again, I'm seeing all news through some '40s/'50s/early-'60s prism. Maybe Ishould have a doctor check this out.) Anyhow, I have an impolitic question:Have any of the big disasters we've been serially warned about for the last 20years (multiple hurricanes, one or two comets, mobs of starving childrenpost-welfare-reform, etc.) actually occurred in New York? The media-boy crieswolf an awful lot.            OK, maybe I'm a conservative after all.            And indeed, I'm afraid I do think most cops in New York ticketing thedouble-parked car of a courteous black man carrying cats would speak exactlythe way my cop spoke to me on Court Street in Brooklyn. In fact, it was hisstern, ridiculous policemanese--"Step away from the vehicle!"--that surprisedme, since I'm, you know, white, and middle-aged, and wear glasses.            I too like Bill Bradley, and expect to vote for him in the primary. A friendof mine who's a theater director recently told me that I should tell anotherfriend of mine who's a speechwriter for Bradley that he, the director, wouldlike to help coach the candidate in big-audience performing skills. Which Ithink would be a good idea. And which I also think is a very rich premise for acomedy sketch.            But my problem with politics these days (which I suppose can come across asconservatism--and may well be, in the old-fashioned sense) is that politicsdon't and really can't matter all that much in this country right now. Thereare rough, large consensuses on all the big issues--economics, social welfare,civil rights, women's rights, war and peace, even abortion. And they willcontinue as long as the economy chugs along like this and we stay out of warsany longer than a mini-series. Sure, there's a biggish, scary lunaticright--the Gary Bauerite creationist anti-gay regiments--but they're not goingto be running the country or amending the Constitution anytime soon. In fact,Pat Buchanan is right about the virtual indistinguishability of the Democratsand Republicans. I sympathize with both Buchanan and Warren Beatty viscerally,if not ideologically. I really think national politics kind of needs to beblown up and rebuilt. For the couple of weeks seven years ago before herevealed himself to be a horrible, crazy gnome, Ross Perot seemed to me like agreat idea. And if next November the candidates are George Bush, Al Gore, andJesse Ventura, it isn't inconceivable that I would pull the lever for Ventura.And I certainly wouldn't be very upset if Bush won, even if he can't name asingle book he's ever read. (One final theory of mine: In presidentialelections, the candidate who wins is the one who seems 1) most convincinglylike a sportsman and 2) happiest. I think the only clear exception to the rulefrom FDR-Hoover through Clinton-Dole is 1968, but that one was very close, andit was 1968, when all bets were off.)            Have a safe trip to Los Angeles.
