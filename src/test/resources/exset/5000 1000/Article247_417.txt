                                 Presspourri            As often happens on a Sunday, the papers are dominated by non-breakingstories, which could have run today or a month from today. At the New York Timesthe lead is word that GOP leaders are talking about radically overhauling thetax code. At the Los Angeles Times , it's President Clinton's comment thatthe Republicans are hurting the federal judiciary by systematically blockinghis appointments to the bench. The Washington Post leads with details of a 1993 abduction of aLibyan dissident from Cairo.            According to the NYT , the Republicans in Congress have begun anintense debate about how to follow up the balanced-budget amendment, reflectingthe fact that polls show voters are becoming less responsive to mere tax cuts.To lay the groundwork, reports the paper, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, themajority leader, and Rep. W.J. Tauzin of Louisiana announced last week thatthey were embarking on a three-city "Scrap the Code" tax tour in October todebate the merits of Armey's flat tax vs. Tauzin's national retail sales tax."Last Thursday, the two kicked off this philosophical quest by throwing copiesof the federal tax code into a large garbage can.            The Post lead asserts that the CIA now has convincing evidence that aleading Libyan dissident who was a U.S. resident just months away fromcitizenship was abducted from a Cairo human rights conference with the help ofEgyptian agents and spirited off to Libya where he was murdered. This findingis said to have upset relations between the U.S. and Egypt. The paper says thatthroughout the course of U.S. officials' investigation of the incident, theirrequests for help from Egypt have produced only limited cooperation, and thatthis month Al Gore privately demanded that Egypt's Hosni Mubarak order a fullinvestigation.            The NYT today begins the first of two pieces on educational testingwith a piece on the failure of the field's largest company, the EducationalTesting Service (a nonprofit with an annual revenue $400 million), to getcheating under control or to disclose security problems to the test-takingpublic. The company, says the paper, prefers to sweep its dirt under the rug toprotect its dominant share of the testing business instead of spending themoney to tighten security. The story details widespread cheating on thecompany's Louisiana state school principals' test and the English proficiencyexams it administers as part of the citizenship process. And as first reportedin the Times recently, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have busted anationwide cheating operation on graduate school and ESL exams.            Bob Dylan is very much blowin' in the wind, with an omnibus review of hisoeuvre on the front of the NYT "Arts and Leisure" section and a pictureon the top front of the LAT of him performing yesterday for thePope.            In the wake of its handling of the Marv Albert story, Friday's column askedthe WP to clarify its policy on naming names. Almost as if to oblige,today's Post "Ombudsman" column examines that policy, primarily bysurveying the spectrum of views held by various senior editors. But a lot isleft unclear. The paper's policy as stated in Friday's Albert story was "TheWashington Post does not identify victims of alleged sexual assaults."The "Ombudsman" column says the policy is to not name "a person accusinganother of a sex crime." (These are not the same thing: a person accusinganother of a sex crime against a third party would be covered by the Sundaypolicy, but not by the Friday one.) The original problem, previously pointedout, was that, in the Albert story, the Post violated the policy statedin that story within mere column inches, by identifying the second woman whotestified in the case. It can be pointed out now that the revised policy hasthe same problem. And even the latter doesn't seem like the paper's de factopolicy. Can we really believe, for instance, that John Bobbitt's name was neverused during the Post 's coverage of his wife's trial for sexually maiminghim?
