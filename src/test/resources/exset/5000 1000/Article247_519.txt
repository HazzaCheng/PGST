                                 Today's Special            What's so special about special prosecutors these days? USA Today andthe LosAngeles Times lead with Janet Reno's decision to ask that one beappointed to investigate if Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's decision toreject a casino application opposed by major Democratic party contributors hadany connection to subsequent donations they made. The New York Timesleads with Kenneth Starr's unprecedented subpoenaing of members of PresidentClinton's Secret Service detail. The Washington Post goes with the revelation that U.N. weaponsinspectors have uncovered evidence that in 1995 Russia had agreed to sell Iraqsophisticated equipment that could be used to develop biological weapons. Thisdisclosure, says the WP , puts a new spin on Russia's recent diplomaticefforts to modify the inspection procedures applying to Iraq: perhaps they aredesigned, not to head off a war, but to keep such mass destruction fingerprintsfrom being lifted.            Our grandchildren may look back at this as the year when the branch of theCabinet known as Special Prosecutions started on its way to becoming thelargest single entity in the federal government (Motto: "The Purpose ofGovernment is to Investigate Government"). USAT and the NYT (inits front-page piece) note this is Reno's fourth request for a specialprosecutor looking into a Clinton Cabinet officer and the Times addsit's the sixth one appointed overall during the Clinton administration. TheTimes goes on to observe that this is the first Clinton-era outsideinquiry into political fund-raising. (You'll recall Reno declined to go thespecial prosecutor route over Clinton-Gore coffees and phone calls.)            The papers all emphasize, however, that Reno's request is "very narrow inscope" (the NYT 's words). And the LAT says any subsequentbroadening of this mandate would be "unusual." Hmmm.perhaps someone shouldcheck this with that key figure in 1970s Arkansas real estate deals, MonicaLewinsky.            Starr's move on the Secret Service raises novel arguments. Agents havetestified before (most famously about the Watergate taping system), but neverabout what they saw or heard the president do. As a WP editorial pointsout, the agents are law enforcement officers and so shouldn't be any moresilent about illegal activities than say, an Arkansas state trooper. But on theother hand, the NYT points out that the Secret Service argues that if apresident physically distances himself from his protective detail out of fearsfor his confidentiality, security is compromised.            More Monica news: Marcia Lewis' second day of grand jury testimony endedabruptly, says the NYT , when she became physically and emotionallyunable to continue. She's expected back today. Her daughter will nestle intothat pre-warmed hot seat early next week.            The USAT front carries word that the EPA is considering requiringlocal water systems to issue reports on the chemical contents of their water toconsumers. The story also makes the LAT and WP , which reportsthat the FDA is considering requiring similar labeling on bottled water. Thisis key: without the ability to know what's in tap water alternatives, knowingwhat's in tap water isn't worth much.            A Wall Street Journal "Politics and Policy" piece onthe post-affirmative action drive to do away with SATs as a college admissionstool reports that after the Texas legislature passed a law that in effectreplaced SAT scores with high school class rank, Texas A & M Universityfound that some high schools are reporting that 25 percent of their studentsare in the top 10 percent of the class.            A letter to the editor in the NYT points out there wassomething odd in the recent Times charge in an editorial that PresidentClinton can't prove his sweeping assertion that Kenneth Starr has illegallyleaked grand jury testimony. The writer notes that the Times could helpin this regard, since it has run stories apparently benefiting from leakedinformation relating to grand jury testimony. But although the topic isimportant enough for a NYT editorial, don't look for any Timesnews stories to really dig into such leaks, as they are the lifeblood of thepaper's scandal coverage.            Readers are asked at this point to observe a moment of silence. Afteryesterday's nee-saying debacle, TP's eighth-grade French teacher, Mme. Teller,hung herself.
