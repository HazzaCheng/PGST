                                 The Beginning of Wisdom Is Disaggregation                        Dear David:            Many questions. Many "methodological difficulties." How can I sort theseout? The old method, in cheder , is to tell a drusha , to tell astory. (In my old age, I regress to the methods of my youth.)            In 1946, William Fielding Ogburn, the leading sociologist of social change,wrote a sober book, The Social Effects of Aviation , in which he soughtto trace out the possible impact of airplanes for the remainder of the century.He looked to see how aviation might affect our lives in 21 different areas,such as population, family, cities, religion, health, environment, recreation,crime, education, marketing, agriculture, public administration, internationalrelations--you name it. Quite an exhaustive list for effects from a singlecause.            Ogburn began with population, since those changes "affect almost all thephenomena of social life," and went on to say : "Aviation will probably havethe effect of reducing the number of births slightly." One rubs one's eyes in"slight" astonishment.            Ogburn was reasoning from the economist's model of the introduction of theautomobile, since "families postponed the expense of ... rearing a child inorder to own an automobile. ... In a similar manner some families will besmaller than would otherwise be because of the expense of owning and operatingan aircraft."            What? What? What? (as George III would say). Yes, at that time thegovernment had made that assumption. Eugene Vidal, the undersecretary ofcommerce (and father of Gore Vidal), had said that with the development ofhelicopters, about 710,000 families (out of 32 million in the United States)would have private airplanes, the reason being that these were the ones withincomes of more than $10,000 a year. A lot of people today fly a privateplane--I do not know the number. But the initial assumption was flat wrong.            A number of years ago, Dennis Gabor won the Nobel Prize for inventing thehologram. Many people thought that this would "transform" our lives. Fifteenyears ago, AT&T "predicted" that we would all have picture phones in ourhouses. What? What? What? I do not mean to jeer, but the point is that,beginning with Future Schlock (endorsed by Richard Nixon and later byNewt Gingrich), every technological change is hailed with a whiz, boom, bang,etc.            You use the phrase "the rate of technological change." The only trouble isthat we do not know how to measure it. Technology is a large globule of manydiverse components. Rate is a metric, but what is it? Economists measuretechnology as part of total factor productivity, but usually as a residualafter all the other factors (capital, labor) have been measured. Not veryglamorous. And of limited use, since it does not deal with institutional andorganizational changes.            Some technologies can be "predicted"--some forecasters define it as"envelope curve" projections--if you can define the narrow parameters and thephysical constraints of particular items, such as Moore's Law on computer-chipspeeds and size, or more broadly, the change from a propeller drive plane to ajet engine--but there, the upper limits are 16,000 miles an hour, for that isescape velocity and you are then not in cyberspace but real outer space.            The beginning of wisdom, I suppose, is disaggregation and particularity, andonce these have been carefully defined, to begin to generalize throughtheory (which brings me back to where I began yesterday).            On primordial identities: I don't believe in single identities, butthere are root identities such as being a Basque, a Catalan, a Kurd, oran Occitan, especially when there is a need to assert such a root identityagainst a larger, sometimes more smothering polity or culture. But let mereserve that for another day.            Love,Dad
