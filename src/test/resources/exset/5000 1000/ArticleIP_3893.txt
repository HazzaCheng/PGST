Full ofBoulogne                        The current installment ofthe e-mail novel "Reply All" speaks of the Bois de Boulogne as "north of Paris." Withother former inhabitants of the Boulevard Suchet, which runs along the Bois, Ihave always walked west into the Bois, which lies on the western edge of thecity.            Pleasepass this correction on to the author of the segment, along with myappreciation for the writing that is being done in this intriguing format.            -- Kevin A.Demetroff Fort Wayne, Ind.                           Miffed inLittle Rock                        Mark Hosenball's dissectionof Ambrose Evans-Pierce's brand of "journalism" ("What AmbroseKnows") was accurate--to a point. Evans-Pierce's articles are full ofhooey, though sickeningly fascinating to read. But Hosenball's references toArkansas as "Dogpatch" and a place with a political culture akin to Honduras orHaiti was beyond the pale and was just poor writing. What research determinedthat our law enforcement is "corrupt and inefficient"? For a man so critical ofEvans-Pierce's bizarre stories about deep, dark Arkansas, how could he fallinto the same fool's trap of "snobbery or sloth" he accuses Evans-Pierce of inhis writing?            Arkansasis not a Jurassic Park of politics, law enforcement, or culture--a factthat Hosenball would be aware of if he had spent any time in this state or doneany additional research for his article. We are no more incestuous orinterconnected than New York or Chicago. For a poor Southern state, Arkansashas a proud heritage of progressive politics running from Senate MajorityLeader Joe T. Robinson; to the first elected female senator, Hattie Caraway, inthe 1930s; to Senators J. William Fulbright, David Pryor, and Dale Bumpers;through Governor and President Clinton. I would trade our crime rate and ourquality of life with almost any other place in our nation, as would thethousands of migrs we get every year. Though we have always been poor in ournatural resources, we are rich in the quality of people that we produce. Iwould expect a student of American politics to be aware of this fact.Hosenball's tone of unsubstantiated snobbery toward my state, though attackinga figure I hold in humorous contempt, is itself the "journalism of fools."            -- Collins DevonCockrell Little Rock, Ark.                                             Slate receivedseveral letters mourning the end of Mark Alan Stamaty's cartoon series"Doodlennium":                                       Doodlehead                        I just wanted to thank youfor allowing Mark Alan Stamaty a forum for his hilarious--and ofteninsightful--cartoon about a (slightly) warped world. While it challengedTwin Peaks in obscure plot turns, it was ever entertaining, and thefirst spot I'd stop at on your site. OK, OK, I get the magazine reallyfor the articles, but I always look at the pictures first.            While Ihope there's a follow-up planned, I realize the wise artist knows when to walkaway. (While the audience is clapping for more.) Thanks again for enduring whatmust have been a trying cartoon to publish.            -- PatrickO'Brien                                       CryingFowl                        TheHendroids won???!!!!

I'm referring to "paradox," which is used wronglyin three separate instances in your Dec. 13 issue. The word serves well indescribing the curious concept of a logical impossibility. ("This sentence isfalse.") The word looks pretentious and silly, however, when it is used as asynonym for "conflict," "irony," or "contradiction."            -- MarthaMarone Lake Oswego, Ore.
