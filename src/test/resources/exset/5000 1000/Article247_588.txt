                                 Suharto Say Goodbye            The continuing Indonesia turmoil leads at USA Today andthe New York Timesand is the top non-local story at the Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes . Suharto's surprise announcement that he would step down failedto ease political tensions, because he described a gradual and vague transitionto a successor, and the thousands of student protesters want him out now. "Iftomorrow Suharto does not step down, there will be a lot of trouble," oneprotester tells USAT . The LAT says it now seems likely Suhartowill go.            The papers say that the nation's top opposition leader had called for amillion demonstrators to take to the streets of Jakarta, and that the military,primarily via stern television messages, urged them not to. The WP 'sveteran correspondent Keith Richburg says the scene at the Indonesian parliament, where students havetaken over the grounds and buildings, is "eerily reminiscent of Beijing'sTiananmen Square." Mirroring earlier reporting, the NYT says relations between the students and troops appearfriendly.            A State Department spokesman is quoted in USAT and the WPsaying that because of the upheaval, the IMF will probably delay delivery ofits next bailout payment. The World Bank has already done this.            The WP confuses with a front-page piece asking whether comparinghealth insurers' reimbursement handling of Viagra to their handling of birthcontrol pills reveals a bias towards men. The second paragraph of the story saysthat more than half of Viagra prescriptions are being subsidized by healthplans, and the sixth paragraph says that slightly more than half of all birthcontrol pills are. Where's the bias? Why do we need this story?            The NYT 's front reports on the first hard political consequences ofthe China money-for-missile-technology charges it aired last week: NewtGingrich announced Tuesday he'll seek to set up a special House panel to look into the allegations. The story alsomakes the USAT front, where Gingrich is quoted saying, "This a deeperquestion than anything that has arisen before in this administration." Gingrichalso tells the paper that President Clinton should not embark on a planned tripto China until he answers to Congress.            A shocking episode reported in a buried wire story inyesterday's WP moves up to page two in today's Post . LastSaturday while playing basketball near a hospital emergency room, a fifteenyear-old boy was shot. Emergency room doctors and nurses were notified of thesituation by a police officer, but citing hospital policy, they refused toleave the emergency room to come to his aid--thirty-five feet away. And refusedto lend the cop a gurney. Ninety minutes later, the boy was dead. "I will befinishing my thirty-fourth year as an officer," said the policeman, "and I havenever seen anything like this."            The editorials continue to weigh in on the lawsuits brought againstMicrosoft. The LAT lead editorial, "Bill Gates is Wrong," takes exceptionto Gates' Coke/Pepsi analogy by saying, "Microsoft's ambition to have Windowsplay an integral role in virtually every American lifestyle is more like Coketelling Americans that from now on it will be their beverage, main course anddessert." (It seems that the law of beverage monopoly is wondrouslycomplex--"Today's Papers" recalls not being able to bring its own beer intoDodger Stadium and not being able to get a Coke at a Taco Bell.) In any case,warns the LAT , if Microsoft doesn't compromise, it could find itselfbeing broken up by the Justice Department into "Baby Bills."            Remember that scene in "Sleeper" where it's revealed that in the futureeverybody knows the only really healthy substances are red meat and cigarettes?Well, today's WP runs a story headlined "Smoking May Protect Some High-Risk Womenfrom Breast Cancer." Seems that for two types of breast cancer that compriseabout ten percent of all cases, what's lucky is a...Lucky.            A front-page Wall Street Journal feature visits the mercenary mouthsbehind political campaign commercials. A small coterie of voice-overspecialists, it turns out, earn over $500,000 a year narrating the commercialsfor hundreds of candidates. New phone technology allows them to do this fromtheir own houses with assembly-line efficiency and relieves them of the onerouschore of actually meeting the candidates. One of these elite announcers,reports the Journal , once inadvertently worked for both sides of acampaign.
