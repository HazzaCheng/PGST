                                 Analyst Whores; Qualcomm Soars                        If there's one thing to hope for after this day on which the Nasdaq leaptover 4,000 (hardly a month after it crossed 3,000), it's that three months fromnow no one remembers Walt Piecyk's name.            Piecyk is the Paine Webber telecom analyst who this morning put a 12-monthprice target of $1,000-a-share on Qualcomm, which closed yesterday at $503 ashare. Piecyk's call sent Qualcomm's stock back off to the races. It opened at$560, and ended the day at $659, which is a leap of 31 percent. That'srespectable by any standard, but it's especially remarkable when you considerthat Qualcomm, before today, was already the best-performing stock in theS&P 500 Index, up about 1,800 percent for the year. (It's now up betterthan 2,300 percent.)            I know, I know. These numbers are effectively gibberish, especially since Icould fill this column every day with stories about stocks making incrediblemoves upward. So why does it matter or not matter whether in May the mention ofWalt Piecyk's name will be greeted with anything other than "Who?"            The simplest answer is that the success of calls like Piecyk's--success heremeaning just that investors buy on the news of your price target--leads to morecalls just like it. When Henry Blodget, who was then at CIBC Oppenheimer, saidthat Amazon's shares would hit $400 within the year (he was right), itcatapulted him into national attention and, in some sense, probably got him hisnew job at Merrill Lynch. And other analysts noticed. When FreeMarkets, a hotnew business-to-business company, went public a few weeks ago, an analyst at afirm that wasn't underwriting the deal initiated coverage on the day of the IPOand set a price target of $300 a share, even though the company was goingpublic at $48 a share. It's become almost de rigueur , in fact, foranalysts to make audacious calls. Otherwise they won't even be noticed.            You can see the same phenomenon at work in analysts' estimates of thingslike that fabled Internet business-to-business market. For a while now, thenumber everyone's been tossing around is $1.3 trillion in 2003. But that meansthat if you're an analyst and you cite that number, no one will notice you. Sonow the numbers are getting ratcheted up, to the point where a recent Goldman,Sachs study said the market could be as large as $2.5 trillion. (And, ofcourse, here I am mentioning the report.)            The phenomenon of number creep is bad because we want analysts to reachconclusions they think are true, and not conclusions that they think are goingto get them on CNBC. (I realize this is incredibly naive, but there it is.) Andthe truth is that there still isn't enough accountability for these kinds offorecasts to make the rewards and punishments for success and failurecommensurate. But the phenomenon is also bad because these kinds of calls havebecome market-moving events, which means that it's no longer irrational totrade as a result of them, at least if you're a trader.            According to a traditional definition of "information" about a stock (as in,a stock's price reflects all the available information the market has aboutit), Piecyk's report was not new. Moreover, when you consider that Qualcomm wasalready up 1,800 percent for the year, the appropriate question to ask isprobably: "Why are you just starting to cover this stock now?" But if webroaden the definition of "information" to include everything that might affectthat stock's price, even in the short term, then the report has to beconsidered new information, which means that it has to affect the stock price.And that means that ignoring it is not necessarily rational, even ifthere's nothing valuable about Piecyk's analysis.            The best thing for everyone, then, will be for Qualcomm to settle back inthe next couple of months, or even just rise slightly, and for Piecyk'sforecast to be forgotten. In the long run, even in this stock market,companies' stock prices will find their true level. But what has becomeincredibly clear in 1999 is that the signal-to-noise ratio in the stock marketis degenerating (with something like Piecyk's report being noise), and thatmeans that it will take longer for those true levels to be reached.
