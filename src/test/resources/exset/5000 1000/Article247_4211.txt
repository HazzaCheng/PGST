                                 The Millennium's Most Intriguing People                        Dear Dad,            I suspect some readers may be wondering what Kerensky, Kafka, and PrinceLazar are doing at the Breakfast Table. I can only assure them that, in ourfamily, the breakfast table really is like this. OK, not always. In fact, notoften. But sometimes.            Your 1-year-old grandson was sick and kept us up half the night (nothingserious, luckily, and now he's tearing around the house like usual), so if thiswere a real breakfast table, my conversation would not be rising very far aboveoccasional groans, grunts, and frantic gestures towards the coffee pot. Thisbeing the case, I'm not sure how coherently I'll be able to respond to yourinteresting thoughts about the living presence of history. But I'll try.            So: Speaking of the Defenestration of Prague (how's that for a conversationopener?), one of the funniest things about it is that one of the survivingvictims--who fell on a dung-heap, not a haystack--was subsequently knighted,and given the title Freiherr von Hohenfall, which translates roughly as "LordHighjump."            But more seriously, you suggest we talk about the Millennium. What hasinterested me, as a professional historian, about the media's coverage of thesubject so far, has been how relatively little attention has been paid to thehistory of the planet between 1000 and 2000. I expected far more in the way ofexhibitions, TV shows, special editions of magazines, polls commissioned on"who were the most significant figures of the past 1,000 years," and so on,particularly given the enormous interest in history that is demonstrated bythings like the success of the History Channel (history as a living presence,in the living room). All right, there were the special issues of the NewYork Times Magazine . But not as much else as I would have thought.            I suspect one reason is that a thousand years is just too long a period oftime. There is too much to consider. In one sense, the second millennium infact contains nearly everything we think of as "history," for even if wearbitrarily define "history" as stopping in 1950, something like 99.9 percentof all available historical source material dates from after the year 1000. Iwould bet that all the extant written material from all human civilizations foreverything before A.D. 1000 could probably fit on a single DVD disk. It isalready possible to buy a single CD-ROM containing all the written materialavailable from classical Greece and Rome. This is the reason why the TimesMagazine series never really worked, and tended to veer off intointeresting digressions at best, and postmodern silliness at worst.            The difficulty of even generalizing about such a long period is probably thesame reason we are seeing very few predictions about what life is going to belike in the year 3000. How can we even guess at such a thing? Makingpredictions about the world in 2100 is a very uncertain business, as youstressed on Tuesday, but it's fun, and you have at least a chance of beingright (and if some of your predictions involve the lengthening of the humanlife span, and you hit the mark there, you may even still be around to see howyou did on the others). But the world in 3000? Even most science fiction isstill set within the next couple of centuries.            Another reason for the lack of attention, closer to my own concerns, is thatWestern historians no longer have a simple story to tell about the history ofthe second millennium--a single "meta-narrative," to use our jargon. A hundredyears ago, for most historians, and for the general public as well, the storyof the millennium was the story of the Triumph of the West. If you had taken apoll of Americans in 1900 about the most important figures of the millennium,I'm sure Columbus would have come at or close to the top, as an emblematicfigure of this triumph. But today, the picture is much more murky, the triumphmuch more dubious. I suppose "political correctness" has some role in this lossof focus. However, in my current grumpy and groggy state, I'm in absolutely nomood to discuss political correctness. And anyway, more fundamental thanpolitical correctness is surely the fact that the West has not exactlydistinguished itself in this last century of the millennium. Hitler was a childof the West. So were Lenin and Stalin. The horror of World War I was a Westernhorror. Mao and Pol Pot have a certain claim to being called honoraryWesterners, given who their teachers were. And now the century is coming to anend with the Russian army leveling Grozny, as the paper reports thismorning.            Talk to you later,            Love,David
