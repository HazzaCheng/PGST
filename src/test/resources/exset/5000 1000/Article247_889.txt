                                 Save the <I>Snooze</I>!            Nothing delights Culturebox's Slate colleagues as much as poking funat U.S. News & World Report . "Apropos of nothing (again), U.S.News goes with a military cover: "Submarine!," gloatedone recently in the "In Other Magazines" column. "(Three weeks ago, itpublished an equally untimely cover on 20th century military strategists.)"It's easy to bash a magazine whose owner does the same thing at dinner parties,when he isn't shopping the editor's job all over town. That's what MortZuckerman is up to, if a profile in last month's Washingtonian is to bebelieved.            Culturebox's unsolicited advice to her colleagues and Zuckerman: Shush. Aquick review of the charges generally leveled at James Fallows, a formerAtlantic Monthly big-think guy and much-made-fun-of media critic: 1. Heprefers the long view to the short run, stinting reporting for analysis. 2. Hehas little or no news judgment. 3. His magazine is boring.            Point 1 is just not true--if anything there's too much information in aU.S. News piece. As a critic wrote somewhere last year, reading aSnooze article rather like being buttonholed by a retired admiral withway too much time on his hands. But you get more hard facts and historical datafrom the admiral than from almost any other source.            Point 2. Translation: Fallows runs stories no one else runs. One man's poornews judgment is another man's smart market positioning. Rather than go upagainst Time and Newsweek with fewer resources, he publishesWashington Monthly -style tweaks on the news and scours beatsundercovered by the other newsweeklies: the military, the auto industry,education, religion. Hence the (quite enthralling) cover story on life aboard anuclear submarine.            Point 3 is not untrue, but not new either. The Snooze is actuallyless boring than it used to be, and besides, newsweeklies are boring bydefinition. The task of boiling down what the average American needs to knoweach week is fundamentally unglamorous. Nobody in the media really respectsnewsweeklies--not the reporters who work there, who would rather be pushing theenvelope, not their peers in journalism, who measure a journalist's worth bythe number of his scoops. But readers outside the media bubble (and that'severyone who makes a newsweekly his primary news source) want their worldreliably summarized. They don't care about the very latest wrinkle in theMicrosoft-Department of Justice antitrust negotiations. They don't need a fancyyou-were-there lead.            Which leads us to what has inspired Culturebox's news-peg-less rant (in thebest Fallovian tradition): the juxtaposition in the past weeks of two pieces ofcultural reportage, U.S. News 's "Prophets of Pop Culture" and.Time 's "Artists and Entertainers of the 20th Century." By media-bubblestandards, Time 's package outstrips U.S. News 's by a furlong.There are fancy names--Ann Douglas, Helen Vendler, Robert Hughes, TerryTeachout, Deborah Tannen, Witold Rybczynski, Ingrid Sischy--andup-to-the-minute critical judgments. And yet the cumulative effect isoppressive. There's too much too read. Everything is monumental. Everyone iscelebrated. The world just isn't that dramatic and fabulous. Culturebox woundup loathing James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, and Bob Dylan with equal passion. Whatelse can you feel about a man who was "the shifting, stormy center of Americanpopular music in the second part of the very century when the music wasinvented"?                           U.S. News , on the other hand, has neither names nor big-deal profilesubjects. Its package is sizzle-free, shorter (15 vs. 146 pages), andinfinitely more original. The choice of profilees reflects not a fixation oncelebrity but an enthusiasm for the underappreciated: network founders DavidSarnoff and William Paley, the men who created television as we know it; ErnestHemingway, interestingly seen as the father of modern American nonfiction; BingCrosby, rather than Frank Sinatra. Culturebox emerged from the experiencemodestly enlightened, rather than desperately out of breath. Which, in the end,is all she asks.            -- Judith Shulevitz
