                                 Toast, Coffee, and the Obituaries                        Dear David,            At the Breakfast Table these days, quite literally, the first thing I turnto, after scanning the front page of the Times , is the obituaries. Yearsago, some people had a prurient interest in these, such as those who went tothe funeral of the thuggish Hollywood producer Harry Cohn to make sure that hewas dead. But nowadays, so many of my contemporaries and colleagues aregoing--five at Harvard and MIT in the past months--that I turn to those pageswith what Kierkegaard called "the concept of the Dread."            The other day I read in the Times of the death of Niccolo Tucci, atage 91. I had not thought of Tucci in years. He had come to the United Statesjust before World War II as an Italian cultural attach, and a fascist. Afascist? Yes. People forget, or most never knew, that in its early years,fascism was a powerful intellectual movement. Mussolini had been a prominentleft-wing socialist and editor of the party's newspaper. Marinetti, the founderof Italian futurism, was a fascist. As were the modernist playwright LuigiPirandello, the poet d'Annunzio, and the major Italian philosopher GiovanniGentile, who influenced Collingwood and was minister of education inMussolini's government. Tucci had been a follower of Gentile, but broke withfascism during the war and became a member of Dwight Macdonald's circle aroundPolitics , where I met him. He had a tart wit.            In 1945, when I was managing editor of the monthly magazine CommonSense (my editor was Varian Fry, who had returned to New York after savingcountless lives of artists and writers by arranging for their exit from VichyFrance to Spain and Portugal and then to safer havens), I had asked Tucci towrite a monthly column. On what? He asked. Oh, I replied, on, say, "Travels toAmerica." Strange country, he said. Why do they call this America? It was thefirst name of the man (Amerigo Vespucci). Why not Vespuccia? Fine, I said, wecan call it "Travels in Vespuccia," and you can write about the Daughters ofthe Vespuccian Revolution, or the Vespuccian Legion march down the street. Hedid not. It reminded him too much of fascism.            There are, or have been, strong differences between obituaries in theAmerican and in the English press. Those in the American press are usually dryand thin and fail to catch the personality of a man or woman. Those in theEnglish press are often quite personal and written at times by a friend of theindividual. This month, Hugh Massingberd published in England The FifthVolume of Obituaries from the Daily Telegraph ! Obituaries are history. Yetthe times are changing. Witness the long obituary of Joseph Heller in theTimes yesterday, beginning with two columns on the front page andcontinuing, after the jump, to almost a full page inside.            One of the older arts of homage has been poetry. Alfred Lord Tennysonpublished "In Memoriam AHH," more than a hundred verses of elegy and sorrow forhis friend Arthur Henry Hallam. And W.H. Auden published "In Memory of W.B.Yeats" (d. Jan., 1939):                           He disappeared in the dead of winter;The brooks were frozen, the air-ports almost deserted,And snow disfigured the public statues; ...The day of his death was a dark cold day.                        Yeats, of course, wrote his own "death poem":                           Under bare Ben Bulben's headIn Drumcliff churchyard Yeats is laid ...On limestone quarried near the spotBy his command these words are cut!                                                      Cast a cold eyeOn life, or death.Horseman, pass by!                                                         For us, as Jews, the eulogy is not literary but religious. In going eachyear to the cemetery, we place a stone on the monument, in commemoration of theacts of Joshua and Samuel in giving praise to the Lord. But the most affectingact is the kaddish , the statement of mourning that a son says on thedeath of his father. It is haunting its recurring refrain, and keeps pulsingthrough my mind, now, every day. I think of my close friends, Dick Hofstadter,Lionel Trilling, Sidney Hook ... They are now part of history.            But the breakfast is finished, and here is the rest of the cold day ahead...            Love,Dad
