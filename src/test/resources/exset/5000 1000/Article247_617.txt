                                 Starr Crossed            Everybody leads with a federal judge's dismissal yesterday of the tax fraudcase recently filed against Webster Hubbell by Kenneth Starr. The Los AngelesTimes and Washington Post headlines put the matter flatly, speakingonly of the dismissal itself. The USA Todayheadline goes further, stating, "Hubbell Ruling Hurts Starr on Whitewater." TheNew York Timesgoes further still, with the headline "In Slap at Starr, a Judge DismissesHubbell Tax Case," and a second front-page piece flagged "New Rebuke, AndHarsher."            The federal judge, James Robertson, whom all the papers note is a Clintonappointee, ruled that in pursuing the tax case against Hubbell, Starr exceededhis authority and strayed too far from his original mandate of investigatingPresident Clinton's Arkansas real estate investments. Additionally, ruled thejudge, Starr turned Hubbell into an informant against himself in basing the taxcharges on records that Hubbell provided to him under a grant of immunity. Theview of some of the papers that the ruling was a quite personal assessment ofStarr is based in large measure on the judge's description of this recordsseizure as "the quintessential fishing expedition."            The papers note that the adverse ruling is the latest in a string ofsetbacks for Starr: his failed attempt to eradicate the postmortemlawyer-client privilege, the death of cooperating witness James McDougal, therelease from jail of the non-cooperating Susan McDougal, and his failure thusfar to delve into communications between Clinton and his government-suppliedlawyers or into the observations made of Clinton by his Secret Service detail.Most of the stories get a little lost among all these trees, with theLAT alone in high up clearly sighting the forest: the ruling willprobably "make it more difficult for [Starr] to obtain evidence of allegedcriminal wrongdoing by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton," Hubbell's former lawpartner. But, the NYT notes, according to the judge, the ruling doesn'taffect the Lewinsky branch of Starr's inquiry.            The NYT front reports that President Clinton taped an interview for play today on Chinese television in whichhe signaled to ordinary Chinese citizens his support of continued greaterpersonal freedom and to the Chinese leadership that the U.S. has no wish toimpose its will on their country. A Times piece inside says the showthat will run the interview, the popular state-owned news magazine "DailyFocus," resembles "60 Minutes" in that it features hard-hitting investigations(mostly of local, not national officials) unthinkable just a few years ago. Twodifferences though, according to the Times : the program has an audienceof 300 million viewers, and young reporters.            A few weeks back, the LAT reported that a women in the advancedthroes of childbirth asked for an epidural anesthetic to relieve her pain, onlyto be told by the attending nurse that she couldn't have one unless she paidfor it on the spot. The suffering woman offered to write a check or use acredit card, but no, said the nurse, it had to be cash. So the woman wentwithout. Today, the paper's front reports that the hospital has apologized tothe mother and has promised the state of California that it's instituting apolicy of epidural anesthesia to women in labor on demand, regardless of theirability to pay.            The Wall Street Journal "Business Bulletin" reports that thegrowth of registered trademarks using such words as "cyber," "link," and "web"was off 14 percent last year. Two exceptions that remain on the rise are "tech"and "power."            In a LAT "Column Left," Alexander Cockburn reports on a surveyrecently filled out by 141 Washington journalists. Among the results: While 77percent of the general populace think too much power is in the hands of a fewlarge companies, only 57 percent of the reporters asked think this. And forinformation for a story on economic issues, over half the respondents usuallycall someone in the government, while 31 percent usually call someone in thecorporate sector. Only 5 percent contact someone in the labor movement.            Back to Clinton in China: The president, reports the NYT , visited ahousing development illustrating the very recent Chinese phenomenon ofprivately owned residences, and told families there that home ownership is aninvestment in society, the bedrock of middle-class life. Wonder if theTimes had trouble resisting the observation that it's an investmentClinton's never made, a bedrock he's never stood on.
