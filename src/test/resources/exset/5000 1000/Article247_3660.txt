                                 Janet Maslin Leaves the Times. Why?            If Culturebox didn't know better, she would say that Janet Maslin was drivenfrom the New York Times by the shame of almost having Lee Siegel agreewith her.                           Wait a minute. Maslin, the lead film critic, is leaving theTimes ? According to a memo circulated to the staff Tuesday afternoon byarts editor John Darnton, at the end of the year "she will leave the paper andtry life without deadlines." Did she quit or was she fired? It's apretty abrupt departure, and she has no other job lined up, but who knows?What else did Darnton say? He hinted that the job wore her out: "In1973, Hollywood turned out 229 movies. Last year, the figure was more thandouble - 475. Janet's workload doubled correspondingly but she bore it withcustomary grace and Stakhanovite fortitude." What is Stakhanovitefortitude? Stakhanov was a Soviet miner famous for regularly exceeding hisquotas. His prolific labors were endlessly celebrated by Stalin and reviled byeveryone else. In the post-Soviet era, the adjective denotes a teacher's petand drone.                           Is that why the Times got rid of                her, if that's whatit did? Who gets fired for working too hard? But she has taken a lot offlacklately for her chipper enthusiasm about movies everyone else hated, such asThe Phantom Menace or Eyes Wide Shut. Another Timescritic, Michiko Kakutani, even published an essay that implicitly condemnedMaslin for being credulous enough to embrace Kubrick's last film. Wouldn'tit be unusual to fire a film critic for not being harsh enough? It wouldcertainly say something about the difference between the East and West coasts.Can you imagine the art editor of the Los Angeles Times dressing downhis lead critic for sucking up to the studios too much? Well, why didshe suck up so much? In the novel Max Jamison, Wilfrid Sheedshows how the rigors of reviewing crap can reduce a critic to an embitteredhack. Perhaps Maslin, striving to avoid that fate, stumbled onto one equallyunfortunate--she let hope triumph over experience. What would you do ifyou had to watch 475 Hollywood movies a year?                           Ok, I buy that, sort of. But who's Lee Siegel? Lee Siegel is aregular contributor to The New Republic who has become famous for takinga hatchet to all subjects great and small. Novelists Barbara Kingsolver andKurt Andersen, the New York Times Arts and Ideas page, a private salonof left-leaning intellectuals, the entire city of Manhattan--all are treatedwith the same withering contempt. All are seen with the same unwaveringcertainty as avatars of America's cultural decline. Siegel's latest cause,taken up in the current issue of Harper's , is Eyes Wide Shut ,which only he among all critics in America has realized is a great work of art.All the other critics in America--"[o]ur official arbiters of culture"--"havelost the gift of being able to comprehend a work of art that does not reflecttheir immediate experience; they have become afraid of genuine art." All exceptMaslin. And Siegel, in his Siegelesque fashion, can't bring himself to give hercredit for her insight, even though that she was practically the only critic topraise the film: "Not a single critic, not even those few who claimed to likeEyes Wide Shut , made any attempt to understand the film on its ownartistic terms."                           So what does he have to do with Maslin leaving the Times? Well,nothing, now that you mention it. They couldn't have less in common or lesssympathy for one another's worldviews (if Maslin is even aware of Siegel's, sheis not likely to be kindly disposed toward it). Which, if Culturebox wasillustrating a point, rather than manufacturing a conceit, was it: that thesetwo extreme of contrarian critical opinion--Maslin's brittle cheerfulness andSiegel's apocalyptic dourness--have somehow brought their holders to the samelonely place. If I were her, I'd quit too.
