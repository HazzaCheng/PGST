                                 Hanukkah and Combination Skin                        Dear Margo,            An editor at                   Slate               --a Jew--notes that we are ideallymatched partners because we share an obsession with the Chosen People. So I amsure you will understand my feelings of discomfort on this third day ofHanukkah.            As originally conceived, Hanukkah was a celebration of Jewish resistance toa Greek invasion. It has evolved into a test of our ability to withstand agrease invasion. For the last few days, Jews around the world have consumed anunspeakable amount of a delicacy called latkes--potato pancakes cooked in vatsof oil. Today, I am sorry to report, this Jew is doing a terrible job ofresisting the grease. December is already an unkind month for those of us withcombination skin. But on this third day of latkes, many of us awoke to findthat our faces haven't been this splotchy since our bar mitzvahs. A littlesympathy (Margo) or a suggestion for a home-remedy (Prudie), please ...            I am currently en route to Phoenix for tonight's debate between theRepublican presidential nominees. Yes, there is a debate tonight. Yes, MassaGeorge W. Bush will be there. But oddly, John McCain won't be in his homestate. The way I understand it, he'll be piped in via satellite from NewHampshire. I happen to think that this is the latest in a series of shrewdmoves by the Angry White Candidate, who graces the cover of Timemagazine this week. Let Bush share the stage with Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer andSteve Forbes. It can only help to diminish him. Meanwhile, John McCain looksabove the fray in his remote studio. (And if he gets a tough question, he canalways claim that technical problems have prevented him from hearing it.)            This same group of GOPers got together last week and pretty much exhaustedpretty much every available topic of contention. Therefore, I predict tonightwill be especially raucous. Without anything else of substance to talk about,the candidates can fill their time with the ad hominem attacks they've beensaving up. Desperate candidates like Bauer have been threatening to take thegloves off. Before every debate, Bauer aides promise, "Tonight, you'll reallysee Gary unplugged." I'm still waiting and hoping that he'll finally be barkingmad.            Before we get off politics and onto more important questions--like the deathof the sitcom--what is it with drama critic Peter Marks' piece on campaign adson the front page of the Times ? I like the idea of having critics writeon politics. (The Times seems to want to make it a regular feature, withrecent contributions by Caryn James and Michiko Kakutani.) And our friend FrankRich does it brilliantly. But what we like about Frank is that he takes hissharpened pencil and jabs into politicians the same way that he would athird-rate revival. Steve Forbes would be as devastated as badly asFootloose the musical. But Marks, Kakutani, and James seem to be holdingback. The paper is probably afraid of launching napalm-filled lorries from thefront page. So why waste the space?            If we wanted to talk about Jews this morning, there are plenty of ways toget started. There is the burning question: Did the West Nile virus originatein Israel? Then there is the intriguing Safra murder. I would probably rathertalk about the decline of the sitcom, which the Times diagnoses. Itargues the genre is worn out and will be challenged by the rise of the gameshow. This strikes me as bunk. Sitcoms have been expanding exponentially overthe '90s. The wild success of Friends , I think, kicked off the era. ButTV is the classic "Me Too" medium. Success breeds infinite imitation, andinfinite imitation means loads of dreck that garners poor ratings andcancellation. (Soon we'll be reading stories about "The End of the Game Show.")What we're seeing isn't the end of the genre, but a return to equilibrium.We'll have as many sitcoms as we had in, say, 1991. And to this trend I say,"Amen."            If you're looking for me tonight on TV, I'll be the Jew with the badcomplexion.            Unctuously,Frank
