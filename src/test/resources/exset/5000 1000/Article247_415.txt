                                 Mergers and Inquisitions            The Washington Post and New York Timeslead with a big Wall St. merger. USA Today and the Los AngelesTimes go with citizens' revelations of IRS abuses.            The Wall St. news is that Travelers Group announced yesterday a $9 billiondeal in which it will acquire Salomon Inc. and merge it with its Smith Barneyunit, thereby creating the nation's second-largest investment bank. Thedevelopment, coming on the heels of February's similarly-sized merger of MorganStanley and Dean Witter, is widely viewed as signaling the onset of evenfurther combinations of banks, brokerages and insurance companies. In settingout the basics, both papers tend towards breathlessness. This deal, says thePost , gives Salomon "cachet" overseas and "brings together two of theliveliest personalities in finance today: Travelers Chairman Sanford I. Weill,respected as one of Wall Street's savviest dealmakers, and billionaire investorWarren E. Buffett...." Also, the Post gets so caught up it quoted oneWall St. guru as saying the merged company has "all the ingredients to becompetitive with the bulge-bracket firms," but forgets to explain what thatterm means. And the NYT seems thrilled to relate that the deal was firstbroached over duck and oysters beside the pool at the Four Seasons Hotel. Leaveit to USAT to be detached enough from the buzz of it all to wonder ifthe resultant dwindling number of competitors in the brokerage field will leadto higher costs for individual investors.            The LAT gives a lot of its top front to taxpayers' testimony at aSenate hearing investigating the IRS. Besides a large headline over the storyproper--"Taxpayers Tell of Mistreatment: IRS Issues Apology"--there's also alarge photo of one witness and thumbnails of others, all under the headline,"Taxpayer Horror Stories." The paper calls the hearings "unprecedented" andincludes details from witness accounts of being hounded by overzealous andincompetent agents. Perhaps the trump testimony was that of an 82-year-oldpriest telling of the IRS' erroneous attempt to grab $18,000 from a trust fundfor the poor set up by his dead mother. The LAT says the apology offeredby the acting IRS commissioner leaves "little doubt about the veracity of theallegations."            In its lead coverage of the IRS hearings, USAT emphasizes thetestimony of an IRS agent, who said that her agency routinely pursues the poorfor more taxes. She testified that she commonly finds herself going aftertaxpayers in her Texas territory whose homes lack air conditioning, forcing herto wonder why she is there. (She doesn't mention noticing any oysters.)            The Wall Street Journal has a fascinating front-page featureabout a federal court case involving a rancher, the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, and CNN. It seems that when federal agents executed a search warrantat the Montana ranch of Paul Berger to look for signs of poisoned bald eagles(they didn't find any), they included in their raiding party three CNNemployees with video cameras, and the agents themselves were wearing wires thatwent to a CNN feed. None of this was disclosed to Berger. Berger and his wifeare now suing the feds and the network for violating the couple's FourthAmendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure.            The WP has a piece inside detailing serious trouble with a book onthe Kennedys that My Lai-exposer Seymour Hersh is coming out with this fall. Itseems that Hersh had based his project on a cache of secret papers that weresaid to provide the strongest evidence yet for such long-rumored Camelot dungas a prior JFK marriage, his relationship with the Mob and his agreement to payhundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money to his lover Marilyn Monroe.Hersh's publisher, Little, Brown, had been gearing up for a blockbuster, andABC News was planning a documentary. But now, says, the WP , Hersh hasconcluded that the secret source materials are fakes. Hersh's comment to thePost : "That's journalism."
