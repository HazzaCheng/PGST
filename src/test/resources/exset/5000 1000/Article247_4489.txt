                                 Bradley in a Box            A couple of months ago, I described Al Gore's attempt to create alose-lose situation for Bill Bradley. Through the use of relentless, oftenunfair attacks, Gore and his staff thought they could trap Bradley between arock and hard place. If Bradley remained on the high road, emphasizing hispositive message and ignoring the vice president's hectoring, the unansweredcriticism would damage him. But if, on the other hand, Bradley responded toGore in kind, he would be descending to his opponent's level, dispelling hisaura of moral superiority in the process.            Gore's tactic has worked perfectly. During the past several months, Bradleyhas remained Buddha-like on his mountaintop, dismissing Gore's attacks aspolitics-as-usual, but not criticizing his opponent directly or even answeringmost of his complaints. The result has been ebbing momentum for the challenger.Bradley has suffered from both Gore's specific charges--such as the distortionthat he opposed flood relief for Iowa farmers--and from the general sense thathe is a Michael Dukakis- or Paul Tsongas-type of political victim. As if tounderscore the unhelpfulcomparison with Tsongas , the Bradley campaign has been running30-second TV ads in which Niki Tsongas, Paul's widow, says that Bradley isfalling prey to the kind of smear that undermined her husband in 1992.            So with Plan A plainly failing, Bradley has finally switched at to Plan B.His own revised strategy was on view in last night's WMUR/CNN debate, in whichBradley pointedly went after Gore in a way he has not done previously. Bradleyrepeatedly called Gore a liar (though he only used the actual l-word after thedebate), sneakily compared him to Richard Nixon and Rudy Giuliani, blasted himfor pandering to every special interest group under the sun, and wondered howGore would muster enough public credibility to serve as president if elected."And my question to you is, why should we believe you that you will tell thetruth as president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?" Bradley asked,in one of many direct confrontations. He also accused Gore of having onceopposed abortion, of distorting Bradley's health-care plan, and of being toocozy with corporate lobbyists and special interests.            After the debate, Bradley congratulated himself for finally taking thegloves off. "I thought I was doing pretty well counter-punching tonight, quitefrankly," he told Larry King, in a post-game appearance. Today at a rally inManchester, Bradley described his performance as a "fresh start" to hiscampaign. "Last night I decided I'd had it," he declared. "We're going to callmy opponent on what he's been doing."            I expect that Bradley's satisfaction will be short-lived. His newfoundpugnacity plays into Gore's hands as much as his earlier pacifism did. In thedebate, Gore was completely ready for Bradley, turning every accusation of foulplay back on his accuser. "If that's not negative, I don't what it is," Goresaid, in response to Bradley's charge that he is a favorite of Washingtonlobbyists. The vice president also brought up the fact that Bradley injectedWillie Horton into the campaign and was forced to apologize for an unfair ad."I have never mentioned your name in an ad, I have never used your picture inan ad," Gore said. "There is nothing I have said in this campaign that is inany way mean spirited." Every time Bradley took a whack at him, Gore appealedto the ref: "I didn't foul him-- he fouled me!"            Many who saw this debate judged the nonstop quarrelling about who started itto be childish. But that's fine with Gore, since it reduces the two men to thesame level. The point of Gore's litigiousness isn't to establish that Bradley'scampaign behavior really is worse than his own--though he claims it is. It's toestablish that there's no real difference in their behavior. If they're thesame, then Gore is better because he doesn't hold himself out as a paragon ofpolitical saintliness. By his own rules, Gore can go negative so long as hedoesn't make it "personal." But if Bradley goes negative, he's a sanctimonioushypocrite. "If you're going to talk about a higher standard, you're going tohave to live by them," Gore said, clearly delighted to be yanking Bradley offhis high horse. He knows that once Bradley has thrown even a few punches, hecan't reclaim the status of a conscientious objector.            Is there any way for Bradley to escape from Gore's box? Not that I can thinkof.                           (Click                here forBallot Box's review of the Republican debate.)
