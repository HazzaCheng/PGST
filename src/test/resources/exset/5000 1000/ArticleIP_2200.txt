                                 Naked SLATE.                           NakedSlate                        John F. Kennedy Jr., whostyles himself "editor in chief and founder" of George magazine, hasoffered a considerable challenge to magazine editors everywhere by posing nudein the September issue of his publication. For too long, journalists have beencontent to expose other people. Is it not time for them to start exposingthemselves? The thought of naked magazine editors--with the exception of JFKJr., of course--is not one many readers will find appealing. Whatever reasonone might have for subscribing to George , the editor in chief's body isunlikely to be a major selling point for, say, Time or Newsweek .But we in the magazine industry believe deeply--if we believe anything atall--that a trend is a trend and cannot be resisted. Therefore, naked editorsit is.            Here at Slate, though, weeschew grandiose titles like "editor in chief," let alone "founder." At thespecial staff meeting called to discuss the issue of who should bare all forthe good of the magazine, there was a groundswell of support for calling uponthe CEO of Microsoft--but no one volunteered to make the call. In the end, theeditor decided to delegate the challenge of self-exposure to the New Yorkeditor, who delegated it to an associate editor, who delegated it to anassistant editor, who delegated it to the youngest member of our staff, AidanWeed, whose title is Special Issue of the Publisher.            Although Weed does nottechnically bare all, he does--unlike his rival in George --refrain frommaking clever use of light and shadow to hide the aspects of the story thatinterest his readers the most. Like Kennedy, however, Weed uses the occasion tovent some controversial opinions about his relatives. His mother and father, hereveals, are "just terrible parents. They're driving me crazy with their 'eatthis ... drink this ... go to sleep ... stop crying.' " Weed shares Kennedy'start views about his relatives' relations with the baby sitter. "They just useher for their own pleasure," he says. "I get stuck with her, while they go outand party. It's incredibly immature."            And why did Weed agree toput his body on the line--or, rather, online? "It's a statement on the need for... well, it's a symbol of ... oh, heck, I don't know--I'm only nine monthsold.            "But I'ddo anything for Slate," he adds. "I just love that magazine."                           IndexInvesting                        DanielAkst's recent article, arguing that investing in index mutual funds is "evil,"has produced a heated response from Todd Porter, a mutual fund analyst atMorningstar, an independent financial publisher. Akst could not be enticed intoa dialogue on the subject (to continue the theme of the previous item, he andhis wife just had twins), but we publish Porter's response in "E-Mail to the Editors,"and take this opportunity to draw special attention to it.                           OldFolks at Home                        Among the first people tojoin the staff of Slate, way back in 1996, were Associate Publisher Betsy Davisand Program Manager Bill Barnes. Both were longtime Microsoft employees (14years in Betsy's case) who happily embraced this different sort of softwareproduct and the different sort of people (i.e., journalists) it brought withit. Now, after Slate careers that span almost 18 months, Betsy and Bill areboth retiring--at ages 40 and 30 respectively. From which you may concludeeither that Slate is a horrible place to work, or that Microsoft is a greatplace to work.            As production manager andthen associate publisher, Betsy designed and supervised the process by whichSlate gets from writers through editors to you. Publishing on the Web is stillvery new, and Slate's publication process--with its daily postings, e-mail andprint versions, constant redesigns, and so on--is very complicated. Betsy'slogical mind and wonderful laugh, among other gifts, made it all happen (well,most of the time).            And what, exactly, is a"program manager"? Bill liked to explain that on normal software projects, theprogram manager is just that: in charge of the program. On Slate, the programmanager is, in essence, the chief computer guy in a nest of cybernaifs. ButBill took amiably and skillfully to his ambassadorial function, and is moreresponsible than any other person for designing the actual technology behindSlate. He also has written our "Webhead" column, and will continue to contribute to it.            All of us at Slate wishBetsy and Bill the best as they enter their Golden Years. We'll miss you.                           --Michael Kinsley
