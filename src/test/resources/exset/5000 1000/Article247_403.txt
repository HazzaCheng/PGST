                                 Fundseekers            The Albright mission to the Middle East leads at the Los AngelesTimes and the national edition of the New York Times(the metro edition of the NYT leads with the coming NYC Democraticmayoral run-off). At the Washington Post , it's tobacco politics that leads and atUSAToday , it's military reform.            The LAT and the NYT differ from each other about Albright. TheNYT paints a picture in which the Secretary of State's statements uponarrival emphasizing security drew criticism from Palestinians, but praise fromIsraelis. (This is also the tenor of the USAT front-page Albrightpiece.) In fact, the NYT even says that Prime Minister Netanyahu praisedAlbright. But the LAT emphasizes instead Netanyahu's resistance, sayingthat he "rebuffed" Albright's "appeal to cease economic restrictions toencourage the Palestinian Authority to crack down on terrorism."            There is no mention of mideast diplomacy on the WP front, where thelead is the Senate's repeal yesterday of a $50 billion tax credit for tobaccocompanies that had been inserted with little fanfare into the budget bill underthe prodding of Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott. The vote was 95 for, only threetobacco state senators against, and no senator spoke in favor of thecredit.            The USAT lead is the news that in the first major changes sinceVietnam, the Army will announce today that it's expanding basic training fromeight to nine weeks, with the extra time being used for lessons on values andmutual respect, especially for women, who now make up 20 percent of recruits.Tougher screening of drill sergeants will also be implemented.            The heat on Al Gore gets turned up another notch as the WP ,LAT , and NYT each run above-the-fold front-page pieces detailinghow at the Thompson hearings yesterday, an internal memo was produced,apparently signed off on by Gore, that explains that the DNC was routinelydividing all solicited funds into hard (targeted to specific campaigns, highlyregulated) and soft (not for specific campaigns, not highly regulated) moneyaccounts regardless of the nature of the actual solicitation. These papers allpoint out that the memo strongly suggests that Gore knew that the fund-raisingcalls he made from the White House were at least in part to raise hard money,which he had initially denied--as well he might, since the amounts heapparently raised in those calls exceeded legal limits for hard money.            Incidentally, that memo also has Bill Clinton's tell-tale left-handedbackwards check-mark on it too, which is noted in the Wall Street Journal 's "Politics and Policy" column, whichmakes the case that Janet Reno's investigation into whether or not Gore'sfund-raising activities merit an independent counsel's scrutiny will almostinevitably push her into also investigating Clinton's role.            A further sign of fallout from the fundraising morass comes with theWP 's front-page revelation that several Asian-Americans with approvedWhite House clearances were initially prevented from entering the groundsbecause security officials assumed their Asian surnames meant they wereforeigners. And double oops--one of the stymied guests was a member of the U.S.Civil Rights Commission.            Earlier this week, a freshman at Yale, a religious Jew, wrote an NYTop-ed complaining that the casual sex atmosphere of the coed dorms Yale isrequiring him to live in meant Yale was forcing him to violate his religiousprinciples. Today's NYT contains a letter from the Yale Dean, whodoesn't address the op-ed's charges that in Yale co-ed dorms, students arefrequently forced into "sexile" while their roommates are having sex, and thatthe halls are full of people of the opposite gender in various stages ofundress. But the Dean does write, "Yale has a long history of working withstudents to accommodate their personal values, and we would happily exploreaccommodation in this case." "Accommodation" of modesty and abstinence--couldyou ask for a clearer example of backwards campus values than that?
