Woody Allen'sdocumentary-style film about fictional '30s jazz guitarist Emmett Ray (playedby Sean Penn) is "a likable, lively little ditty" (David Ansen,Newsweek ) that doesn't add up to much, but makes for a welcome change ofpace from Allen's recent work. Penn's performance is "mercilessly funny,scarily precise and mysteriously deep. It's a portrait of the artist as aperfect swine" (Joe Morgenstern, the Wall Street Journal ). Britishnewcomer Samantha Morton steals the show as a mute laundress who becomes Ray'slover: "Rarely has a performer mined such complex and potent emotion from suchsimple materials: a smile, a shrug, an attentive winsomeness" (David Ansen,Newsweek ). One critic dissents: Mike Clark of USA Today calls thefilm "depressing" and only "sporadically amusing." (                  Slate               's DavidEdelstein says it's "unexpectedly delectable."

Raves for directorNeil Jordan's ( The Crying Game ) "hauntingly beautiful" (CathleenMcGuigan, Newsweek ) adaptation of a Graham Greene novel. The story of awartime affair that runs aground on one party's religious faith is"[h]andsomely mounted, literate, emotionally sophisticated" (Kenneth Turan, theLos Angeles Times ) and filled with a "dreamy intensity" (Janet Maslin,the New York Times ). Nearly every reviewer notices the cracklingchemistry between stars Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes. USA Today 'sMike Clark gives the film its only pan, citing a "lumbering" story and"soulless" sex scenes.

This "fond, frequently hilarious" (DavidAnsen, Newsweek ) documentary about the Hollywood comedy writer BruceVilanch gets kind reviews all around. "Get Bruce is exactly the kind ofdocumentary we all want to have made about ourselves, in which it is revealedthat we are funny, smart, beloved, the trusted confidant of famous people, thepower behind the scenes at great events and the apple of our mother's eye"(Roger Ebert, the Chicago Sun-Times ). Vilanch has written for just aboutevery current big-screen celebrity, and Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, WhoopiGoldberg, Lily Tomlin, and Rosie O'Donnell (to name-drop a few) appear in thefilm singing his praises.

Kolata, a science writer for the New York Times , hasproduced "an extraordinary account of one of the most significant public healthtragedies of this century" (Elizabeth Whelan, the Washington Times ).Even more fascinating than her account of the original pandemic, Kolata tailsthe various groups of scientists and the divergent paths they traveled as theyunraveled the virus' secrets.

Critics question whether the20 th entry in this series of nautical novels set in the19 th century will actually be the final one, as the author haspromised. But that seems to be the only thing they're skeptical about.Otherwise they lavish affectionate praise on O'Brian and seem to regard hismain characters as old friends. What exactly is the appeal? Some say the booksare "a sort of Hardy Boys for smart, literate men" (Patricia Ward Biederman,the Los Angeles Times ), while others rave about "O'Brian's extraordinarylearning and gift for classical prose" (Amanda Foreman, the New York TimesBook Review ).
