                                 Alan Greenspan Finds Enlightenment                        As has become usual, Alan Greenspan's speech last Friday at the gathering ofthe world's central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., has been ardentlyscrutinized by both the financial press and investors anxious to figure outwhether the Federal Reserve is planning to raise interest rates anytime soon.What's occasioned the most notice, fittingly enough, was Greenspan's argumentthat central bankers needed to pay attention to asset prices--like, oh, thestock market--in addition to the prices of normal goods and services if thebankers want to have a handle on what may drive inflation in the future.            Some commentators have also remarked that Greenspan's speech, far from being"a stark warning," as Reuters termed it, was a tempered acknowledgement thateven central bankers have a hard time figuring out when markets are overvalued.That, in turn, suggests that Greenspan understands now that his "irrationalexuberance" speech of three years ago was precisely what it was, one person'sattempt to outthink a market that it is very difficult to outthink. What'sespecially curious about this is that one would have thought this was aconclusion a supposedly ardent devotee of the free market would have reached along time ago.            Greenspan, of course, has never ascribed to himself (at least not inpublic--who knows what he thinks as he sits contentedly in his bathtub) thelevel of wisdom and farsightedness that the media have come to grant him. Hisremarks are typically shrouded and hedged, and though it is of course the jobof the Fed to restrain inflation and promote economic growth, which requireshim to make at least educated guesses about the future, Greenspan generallydoes seem well aware of the limits of his own knowledge.            This is as it should be, since a fundamental principle of a free-marketeconomy is that the market knows more than any individual within it. ButGreenspan's comments on the stock market--including, but not limited to, the"irrational exuberance" speech--have been oddly dismissive of that principle,and oddly certain that something like a bubble was in place. In his speech onFriday, though, Greenspan acknowledged that market prices are determined by"millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about theprospects for the specific companies" that make up the market indices.            Even more important, perhaps, he suggested that the unprecedented rise instock prices over the past five years in particular was due to a substantivechange in the way the market discounted the future. Obviously, we don't knowexactly what that change is, but it does seem as if stock-market investorstoday think stocks are less risky than they once did, believe that inflation isnot a long-term threat, and believe that the economic dominance of Americancorporations--and the extraordinary recent growth in corporate profits--can beextended for a long period of time. Put those things together, and you end upwith a strong case for higher stock prices. Any or all of those assumptions maybe wrong, of course, but in pointing to the discounting process in particularGreenspan did something important, which was get away from the simple idea of"irrationality" and move toward a more rigorous analysis of what's beenhappening.            The other thing Greenspan's speech signaled is that the Fed is notgoing to jack up interest rates just to prick a stock-market bubble, imaginedor not. In emphasizing that the best, and clearest, use of monetary policy isto revive an economy in the wake of a deflationary crash by cuttingrates, Greenspan seemed to acknowledge that the Fed was ill-equipped to be inthe business of figuring out what stock prices should be. The point of watchingasset prices for the Fed is to understand whether the wealth effect is helpingrev the economy beyond sustainable growth. It's not to scold investors. We maybe heading for a crash (though I don't think so). But if we are, we'll getthere all on our own. Greenspan won't be giving us a push.
