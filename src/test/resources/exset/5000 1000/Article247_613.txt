                                 Cable Hook-Up            Tech/biz dominates today. USA Today and the Washington Post lead with AT&T's purchase of cablecompany TCI. (The story is also on the front at the New York Timesand is flagged in the Wall Street Journal 's front-page news digest.) TheNYT leads with the ruling by a federal appeals court undoing a previouslower court order that had required Microsoft to make Windows 95 availableseparate from its Internet Explorer browser. The ruling is widely viewed asboding well for the company's upcoming federal antitrust trial concerning thecompany's joint packaging of Windows 98 and IE. (This story also makes theUSAT and Los Angeles Times fronts and the WSJ front news boxand gets a front-page "reefer" at the WP .) The LAT leads with theClinton administration's expected announcement today of a plan for givingminority firms preferences in the awarding of government contracts whenindependent surveys show that their share of federal business is smaller thantheir overall market share. The White House hopes, the paper reports, that thenew approach will satisfy a Supreme Court ruling that minority set-asides perse are unconstitutional and that race-based awards are permissible only if theyare a remedy for a proven record of discrimination. Nobody else puts the newpreference plan on the front page.            Of the early editions of the papers available to TP, only USAT 'sflatly states that the ATT/TCI business was a done deal. The acquisition, saysthe paper, will shake both the cable and phone businesses, giving TCI new cloutand phone expertise and allowing AT&T to offer local phone service overTCI's cable lines. The deal could, says USAT 's "Money" section analysispiece, mark the beginning of real competition in both local phone service andcable TV. But the Post shows that it also contains the seeds of greatermonopolies: TCI already has a cable monopoly in virtually every one of itsservice areas, while AT&T already has more than 50 percent of thelong-distance market. The merger will no doubt get a close government review.USAT runs an FCC's commissioner's favorable comment, while thePost quotes a powerful House member's spokesman saying the deal "runs upa red flag."            The NYT 's off-lead concerns testimony given yesterday at a Househearing about how a secret encoded circuit board containing sensitive U.S.technology was missing from the wreckage of a U.S. satellite aboard a Chineserocket that blew up in 1996. The paper says that "the disclosure of the missingcircuit board.was made Tuesday." Well actually, to be fair, it was made by MattDrudge, in his May 20th Report. No mention of Drudge by the Timesthough. The paper reports that the congressional investigation is trying todetermine if the board was missing because the Chinese "took" it. (Wonder whythe Times doesn't say "stole" it.)            The WSJ reports that the result of a recent high-level U.S. military war game set in aconflict between India and Pakistan shocked and disappointed many of the Armyofficers participating: none of the U.S.' heavy divisions could get to theIndian subcontinent in time to have any effect on the war's outcome.            The WP front reports that new laws in Florida governing patient treatment by HMOshave been so effective they may well become the models for federal legislation.Among the provisions: patients needn't go through their HMOs to see theirdermatologists; HMOs cannot forbid doctors to tell patients about expensivetreatments available; and patients can protest to an outside board a plan'srefusal to pay for a procedure.            The NYT front tells of a U.N.report just out disclosing that in certain parts of Africa one in fouradults is infected with HIV--and most of them will die as a result becauseAfricans cannot for the most part afford the combination drug therapies thatcan keep the virus in check--and that worldwide, AIDS now rivals the greatestepidemics of history. The paper says this is the gloomiest picture of thedisease painted since it was first recognized in 1981.            The USAT off-lead reports that the IRS reform bill moving towardspassage in both houses of Congress now includes a provision lowering from 18months to just one year the holding period required to enjoy a drop in the taxon investment profits from a top rate of 28 percent down to a 20 percent. Thedevelopment is also on the NYT front and inside at the WP .            The WP carries an AP story inside reporting that Pennsylvania policehave charged two Amish men with buying cocaine from a motorcycle gang and thendistributing it to young members of their sect. This is apparently the firstdrug case ever involving Amish people. Stay tuned for horse and buggydrive-bys.
