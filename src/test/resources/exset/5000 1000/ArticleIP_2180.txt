                                                            Hope forthe Best                        "At this juncture, we allshould hope for the best."            So concludes an especiallymuddled editorial Feb. 25 in the Wall Street Journal . The muddle wasunderstandable, given that the topic was on-again, off-again, on-againWhitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The Journal 's editorialpage spent the 1980s vilifying the whole idea of independent counsels as ascandalous waste of money and an unconstitutional infringement upon executivepower. But that was when Lawrence Walsh was investigating President Reagan. Nowthat it's a Democratic president under investigation, the Journal isnaturally conflicted. Its former thundering constitutional anathemas are nowrepositioned as genteel "doubts" about the "extra-legal character" of "aninstitution still evolving."            Still, "At this juncture, weall should hope for the best" is remarkably unhelpful advice. Is there anyeditorial ever written to which this last sentence could not be attached?("Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. At this juncture, we all should hopefor the best.") Have we missed some other juncture, in the course of humanevents, at which the Journal would not have recommended that weall hope for the best? Will the Journal inform its loyal readers when wemay abandon the strain of hoping for the best and return to the less exhaustingtask of fearing the worst? Do we really need the distinguished Wall StreetJournal editorial page to tell us to hope for the best? One might as wellturn to the Journal 's news pages to be told to "buy low, sell high."            Whencontemplating a high-risk course of action, such as hoping for the best, it isalways advisable to get a second opinion. At this juncture, we consulted BillGates. Would he recommend hoping for the best? At this particular juncture? "Mydear fellow," he said, "Don't hope for the best. Demand the best." Andhe added, "Buy low, sell high."                           Contest                        A decade ago, the editor ofthis publication staged a contest in another publication to name thethen-burgeoning Iran-Contra scandal. The premise was that scandal handlesending in "-gate" had become too tiresome, and that "Iran-Contra" was tooclumsy. This turned out to be wrong on both counts, as that scandal came to becalled "Irangate" by some and "Iran-Contra" by most. The winning name in thatcontest--"Iranamok"--was delightful, witty, and euphonious, but never tookoff.            Undaunted,let's try again. Anybody got a good name for the now-burgeoningDemocratic-Asian-Connection-Lincoln-Bedroom-Fund-Raising Scandal? Nothingracist, please, and nothing (once again) ending in "-gate" (unless it'sreally good). Post your suggestions to "The Fray," our reader-discussion forum, or send e-mail to slate@msn.com.

Reels onWheels                        Slatereaders who recall John Cassidy's article a few weeks back about a lavish"Hollywood Party" he attended at the home of Hollywood mogul MikeMedavoy might have enjoyed a New York Times feature about Medavoy Feb.25. The party described in the Slate piece was intended to signify Medavoy'striumph over adversity: new wife, new job, and so on. In the Timespiece, Medavoy touchingly describes the kindness and generosity he discoveredduring his adversity period: "Even the courier who used to bring films to me athome said he'd be happy to bring them to me for nothing." What a heartwarmingstory! Calling Frank Capra! Imagine: a fallen mogul almost reduced to seeingmovies in a movie theater, saved from this humiliation by a big-heartedcourier. If more couriers took a moment to show a bit of human compassion forthe film producers in their midst, this old world would be a heckuva betterplace.            -- Michael Kinsley
