                                 Men at Work                        Dear Shoshana,            Let me first comment on the end of what you say--aboutthe British echoes of Faludi's findings. This shouldn't surprise you. Maine hasno global reach; Los Angeles does. When British men feel out of it, bycomparison to those sleek, buffed males merchandized globally, the merchandisethat oppresses and obsesses them comes from Los Angeles and New York.            In a way, you are unfair to Faludi; her interviewsreach beyond the style epicenters. But I think you are right on target inpointing to the immense divide between wired-up, screwed-up America (which iswhere the money is), and a quieter America where men may suffer far less fromidentity crises because they are trying to get by rather than get ahead. When Ilived in New York, it drove me crazy listening to people complain about makingonly $100,000 a year; they suffered from epicenter-envy of people who made$200,000 and spent $300,000. There's no gendering these days in epicenter-envy,the Manhattan female hotshot is as obsessed about the people who stand aboveher as the male of this species--which again is why I think the story Faludihas told is about men in capitalism, rather than men as such.            What her interviews show is a new chapter in thesubject Americans never talk about: class. Many of the men Faludi interviewedare being lumped into a new synonym for class; they are "losers." In the lastgeneration, as we know, the gap between winners and losers has grown; thewealth of the top 20 percent has expanded, the wealth of the middle 60 percentstagnated or declined, the resources those in the bottom 20 percent can commandhas declined. As our society becomes more unequal, however, the imagery of howpeople ought to live, the ideals of self and mutual respect, are increasinglydefined by behavior and possessions at the top. Thus the gnawing sense of being"out of it" that surfaces among the ordinary people Faludi interviewed, thefear of falling behind. This is how class works in America: a shared imagery oftaste and behavior; a stark inequality of material, educational, and socialmeans in measuring up to the image of how you ought to be. And this is why,when Faludi uses the word "emasculation," what I think she is evoking is a fearof diminished potency which is more economic than sexual.            You attack, Shoshana, the argument Faludi makes thatmen suffer in large part from a crisis of masculinity because they have failed"role models" in their fathers--i.e., "My father never taught me to be a man."I have to confess that this argument, which I've heard for years applied toblacks, makes me, like you, deeply uneasy, though in my case for quite personalreasons. I was raised by a resolutely single mother who in the 1950s wassubjected in Minnesota to the widespread prejudice that by not living in anuclear family, she was doing me untold psychic harm. In my own case, thisdidn't prove so, but the prejudice in favor of nuclear families is deeplyengrained in American life. Do you think Faludi is reviving it?            As you say, the myth of the strong father is one thing;the reality is often quite another: often tyrants who are intimidating ratherthan encouraging. My own experience of parenting is that adult firmness coupledwith irony and occasional bouts of silliness makes for sturdy children. Perhapswhat Faludi was hearing when people told her, in one way or another, "My fathernever taught me to be a man," was a complaint about American childhood. I knowof no country in which children lead more lonely isolated lives, isolated fromsocial contact with children unlike themselves and from adult society. Youcan't be taught just by rules how to be a man or a woman; you learn adulthoodfor yourself, and to learn adulthood well you need far more exposure to reallife, its horrors and difficulties as well as its pleasures, than Americansociety makes available to children. This is why, I think, Americans oftenremark about European children that they seem older, more self-possessed.            My question to you about this book is, if American menare in the trouble Faludi thinks they (we) are, what's to be done about it?You've written about cooperation in the workplace. Do you think the ills sherecounts might be righted if in communities there were more opportunities formen to cooperate? Faludi seems in part to believe a more interactive society,less oriented to displays of potency, would ease crises of masculinity.            My own views head off in another direction--but I'llsave that until I hear what you have to say.
