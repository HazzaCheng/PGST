                                 Why <i>Saturday Night Live</i> Is Not Anti-Semitic            Is anti-Semitism always anti-Semitic, or can it be something else? AbrahamFoxman of the Anti-Defamation League thinks it's always anti-Semitic, butCulturebox disagrees. The case in point: A little more than a week ago, Foxmanwrote a letter to NBC asking it never to rebroadcast portions of a Dec. 4Saturday Night Live skit he said were offensive to Jews. NBC firstagreed not to. But after SNL 's executive producer, Lorne Michaels,objected, the network put the matter "under review." The sketch in questionparodies a recent CBS Christmas special And So This Is Christmas . Theidea is to do a promotional spot for the forthcoming CBS special "And SoThis Is Hanukkah ." For those who didn't tune in on Dec. 4, it went likethis:            Strains of bad klezmer music and a portentous voice-over give way to clipsof pop stars (played by SNL cast members) singing Hanukkah songs. Thefemale performers wear scanty clothing and make crude sexual gestures. The menwear yarmulkes and rap exaggeratedly or dry-hump their backup singers. Thesongs range from the mildly amusing to the unfunny. "Lou Bega" replaces"Monica" with "Hanukkah" in his famous refrain, "A little bit of Monica in mylife." "Ricky Martin" does the same with "La Vida Loca." "Tori Amos" sings atorchy holiday ballad while nearly having sex with a piano leg. And divas"Britney Spears" (played by guest host Christina Ricci), "Mariah Carey," and"Celine Dion" share their feelings about the Jewish holiday. "Spears" thinksit's OK because the Christians have forgiven the Jews for killing Christ."Dion" recalls that when she asked her mother what Hanukkah was, her mothersaid it was a holiday celebrated by the people who own the movie studios andthe banks.            It's those last two bits Foxman wants pulled from circulation. Out ofcontext, this isn't crazy, since the Christ-killer epithet has justifiedpogroms for centuries and the international Jewish banking and media conspiracytheory is alive and being propagated. But Foxman is wrong to think he needs todefend his people from the producers of SNL , however tasteless they maybe. The people being made fun of in this sketch are not Jews. They're popstars.            Culturebox doesn't mean to suggest that your average pop star is notan ignorant, self-promoting ditzbrain, of course. In the scene Foxman objectsto, however, the mockery is not aimed at pop stars in general. It targets aspecific kind of pop star--the one from a background so low-class she doesn'tknow enough to hide her anti-Semitism. In other words, it's white-trashpop stars who are being insulted, so it is the trailer-park pop-staranti-defamation league, not Foxman's, that should be demanding aretraction.            If you want to understand who exactly is being skewered in "Spears" and"Dion," it helps to think of a scene in a better television comedy in which awhite-trash country singer makes a similarly anti-Semitic remark. (Thisinsight, by the way, is not Culturebox's. It was sent to her by a                  Slate                reader who insists on anonymity but who seems to bepossessed of an astonishing memory. Whether his memory is accurate cannot beconfirmed, since Columbia Tristar Television, which owns the tapes in question,says it is unable to look the incident up.) Culturebox's correspondentwrites:                           With respect to current controversy over SNL /Christina Ricci/BritneySpears, you may recall an almost identical line from Mary Hartman, MaryHartman , back in its first season. Loretta Haggers (Mary Kay Place), Mary'sneighbor and a country singer, got her big break on a Carson-like show. Shetold the host that everyone had been so nice to her in L.A. and rattled off abunch of Jewish names. Then she added, "I can't believe they're the same peoplewho killed our Lord." I'm not sure if it was controversial at the time in thereal world. It did kill Loretta's career on the show.
