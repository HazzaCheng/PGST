                                 Medicare, Technical Truths, and Videotape                           Fool , produced byGreg Stevens for Dole/Kemp '96.            The Democrats andRepublicans accuse each other of lying about their respective Medicareproposals. In fact, neither side is lying: Each selectively cites facts andoffers proof. The Republicans say they want to limit the increase of Medicarespending to 7 percent. This is not a cut, they say, just a slowdown in the rateof growth; the president wanted to cut, too. The Democrats maintain that theRepublicans' increase in spending is below the rate of medical inflation (theRepublicans respond by pointing to the general rate of inflation). Thepresident trimmed the program only a third as much as the GOP plan--which alsowould have prevented millions of seniors from choosing their own doctors, andwould have denied coverage for services like diabetes blood tests (whichGingrich now promises will be a priority in the next Congress).            Despite the bickering, theRepublicans know that Medicare is not their issue. Voters are more likely tobelieve the Democrats on Medicare and more likely to believe the Republicans ontax cutting, which means that there is a limit to what political ads can do toreshape ingrained attitudes. So until now, the Dole/Kemp ads ignored Medicarealmost entirely and engaged in a struggle to make welfare, taxes, and characterthe defining terrain for voters. Fool , produced by Dole consultant GregStevens, abandons that agenda to respond on an issue where Republicans can atbest neutralize, not prevail.            This is the rare kind ofresponse ad that actually and almost exclusively responds. Fool isentirely defensive, despite the obligatory knock on the other side's accuracy.The spot's life begins dangerously, with an excerpt from the Clinton/Gore adthat not only references, but reinforces the charge that Dole sought to cutMedicare. The second scene even shows Dole with the singularly unpopularGingrich--the Clinton campaign's favorite piece of videotape. Fool 'sopening is frontal, audacious, maybe foolish, but the Dole strategistsobviously decided to take the chance. The red "Wrong" stamped across the sceneis a standard technique that does little to detract from the effect of seeingDole with a man widely seen, fairly or unfairly, as the Darth Vader ofMedicare.            The next scenes carry theAARP (American Association of Retired Persons) logo and use quotes from one ofthe lobby's letters as third-party proof that the Dole-Gingrich Medicareproposal was only to "slow" the program's growth--and both parties did itanyway. The next quote--about "finger pointing"--seems to point the finger atClinton. But the AARP fiercely complained that the excerpted quotations werenot true to the organization's letter--which did not take sides againstClinton. The Dole campaign agreed to pull Fool off the air (perhaps, inpart, because some inside the campaign thought it was too defensive and raisedthe salience of Clinton's best issue).            In the next scene, Dolehuddles with seniors on a neighborhood street (is this Russell, Kan.?). Thenarrator says: "The AARP agrees with Bob Dole"--the words leave the impressionthat they agree on what's just been said, and then the narrator continues--"ona bipartisan plan to fix Medicare." The chyron goes even farther: "The AARPagrees with the Dole plan . ..." The admaker would no doubt defend this on thebasis that the AARP wants a bipartisan solution; Dole says he does; ergo ... atruly tenuous technical truth.            The Dole campaign's purposewas not to win on the Medicare issue--it can't overcome a perception thatbasic--but to neutralize an issue which has hurt so much that Jack Kemprecently complained that the Gingrich budget was a disaster for Republicans.The spot ends with a brief nod to the offense: "Don't let Clinton foolyou"--and notice what's underlined. "Fool," of course, is supposed to have adouble meaning: That's what you are if you vote for him.
