                                 The Road to Beverly Hills            Sunday, Oct. 3, 1999.Holiday Inn, Charleston, W.V.            My name is Robert Kaufman. I normally write aboutsocial policy for a small magazine of opinion, but right now I am driving fromWashington to Los Angeles in a 10-year-old Honda Civic with my friend ElizabethAsh. Elizabeth is moving to my hometown, the California hamlet of BeverlyHills, to become a sitcom writer. E's Pottery Barn hope chest is in thebackseat, stuffed with books. Her 13-inch television is in the trunk. On theroof are balanced a wood futon bed frame, E's mountain bike, and E's queen-sizefuton, which I failed to convince her to throw in a Dumpster. The whole pile istied down with a variety of bungee cords, giving my Honda an appearance notunlike an updated version of the Joad family vehicle in Grapes ofWrath .            E has recently written several quickie celebritybios, and here is an instant celebrity-based guide to our characters: For me,think the youthful Elliott Gould of, say, California Split , slowlyturning into the more eccentric Elliott Gould of Kicking &Screaming . For E, think the dewy Mariel Hemingway of Manhattan witha touch of Alan Dershowitz. In the unreadably bad novel I wrote last year, Ewas the basis for a Washington femme fatale . By Page 20, she'd alreadyrun through four men, including the male protagonist, who wrote about socialpolicy for a small magazine of opinion. I trashed the novel when the one personI showed it to was, how to put it, less than fully supportive. "You have noidea how to write fiction," she said. "For instance, you have thischaracter--all he cares about is sex and welfare policy! Nobody will believethat! You have to flesh him out a bit! Give him some real human qualities."            Why would I take a week off from work to drive Eand her stuff 2,800 miles across the country? Because driving across thecountry is my idea of a vacation. I've done it about 14 previous times. I enjoydoing it alone. Doing it with another person is that much better. True, I usedto be interested in E, but that was years ago, and we're now just good friends.I have no desire or expectation that anything romantic will happen on thisjourney. Please remember this, as it is an important point. No expectations.None at all. Zero. Right.            I would say the trip began with three troublesigns. In order of increasing troublesomeness, they are:            1) E is on a health kick and declared, "I only wantto eat tofu on this trip." I try to let her down gently, suggesting that whileof course they surely stock the basic tofu products in, say, Silt, Colo., theymight not have the selection she has come to expect.            2) She mentioned that there is some guy who wantsto meet her in Las Vegas and take her to a show.            3) She has brought a tape of Crosby, Stills &Nash.            We've already discovered that it is hard to followthe news on the road. This morning, at our hotel in Washington, we briefly sawthe new outsider/insurgent candidate for president, Al Gore, giving aninterview to Bob Schieffer on CBS. It seemed as if Gore's thin hard carapace ofimpenetrability has been replaced by a thick, smooth gelatinous coating that isequally impenetrable. But I don't know for sure. I also know there are someexpense-account accusations against Gore's campaign manager, Tony Coelho, butdon't know who the anti-Coelho factions are that are spreading them (or whythey couldn't dig up something bigger).            And has the following point been made on the Op-Edpages: that Arianna Huffington and Warren Beatty have chosen to attack centristDemocrats as cynical sellouts who ignore American poverty just when, accordingto the Census Bureau, those cynical centrists are making the greatest stridesagainst poverty that have been made in my adult lifetime? ("Poverty Drops to 20Year Low"--that was the USA Today headline we saw at a Wal-Mart inMorgantown.) Poor Beatty has a need to think Clintonite Democrats aren'ttackling race and poverty, much like Marx had a need for a proletariat, exceptthat Marx's need was theoretical, while Beatty's is only theatrical. And Marx'swas closer to reality.            The best sign so far? Somewhere in the Marylandpanhandle, E and I were for some reason discussing Wendy Shalit's book, TheReturn of Modesty , which makes the case for chastity, patience, courtship,etc. Shalit argues that when you walk down the street you can tell the virginsby their fresh, healthful glow. E's critique, in full: "I don't know. I alwaysthought it was the girls who got fucked that had the healthy glow." She alsosaid she hasn't had sex in two years, which I didn't believe. But, come tothink of it, she does look a bit pale.
