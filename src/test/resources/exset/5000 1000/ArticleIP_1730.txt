                                 Clinton Does Africa            In Paris Sunday, Le Monde said President Clintonwould leave Africa with the message that the "new Africa" is not willing to bebossed around. Highlighting South African President Nelson Mandela's publiccriticisms of the United States, which it said were a break with "the treatmentusually reserved for the president of the world's greatest power," thenewspaper said in its editorial that Mandela had confirmed that Africa's newleaders were not totally manipulable and controllable people. "This messagewill have to be listened to by the US and by every other power," the editorialconcluded. "The 'new Africa' is not under orders; it will grow up by rejectingtutelage."            InCanada, the Toronto Starpraised President Clinton and Pope John Paul II for the support they had givento African democratic reformers during their visits to the continent, butcalled for a change in Western attitudes toward Africa. In an editorial Monday, it criticized Canada and the United States forparing down foreign aid at a time when poverty was growing in the sub-Saharanregion. It said Northern markets were often closed to African goods, andinvestment in Africa was frequently skewed to benefit the few at the expense ofthe many. "These are attitudes and practices that must change, if we want thepeoples of Africa to regard us as partners, not hypocrites," it concluded.            The Daily Nation of Nairobi, Kenya, published a reader's letter saying that President Clinton's apology forslavery was "too late" and "only rubs salt into wounds." It demandedreparations, although "[n]o amount of compensation will reverse the historicalinjustice by the West." Another letter in the same newspaper said Clintondeserved "a pat on the back" for his visit to Africa, which, it explained,ought to help "refocus world opinion, and especially that of corporate America,on Africa as a paradise for investment."            Theindependent PostExpress of Nigeria said in an editorial that the "international symbolism" of theAmerican presidency had never been greater than today. "If this has been theAmerican Century, it has never seemed more American than in its final decade.When Clinton goes abroad, he does so as the leader of a nation unrivaled in itsprosperity, technology, military might and cultural influence. ... It will notinoculate him from the problems that await his return to Washington, but at amoment of peril in his administration Clinton is enjoying the radiance of thenation he represents."            According to a report in South Africa's CapeTimes , members of the "Americans" gang in the poor Cape Town ghetto ofHanover Park said they wished Bill Clinton had visited them last week, becausehe would have seen that life in Los Angeles was "the same as life here." Theiremblem is the American flag, and they regard Clinton as the "godfather." "Thatflag means a lot of sacrifice," one of them said. "It means that you areprepared to take and carry an illegal gun. ... You must be prepared to breakyour mother's heart."            The Daily Telegraph of London, in areport from Washington by Hugo Gurdon and right-wing conspiracy theoristAmbrose Evans-Pritchard, gave front-page prominence to allegations in the PaulaJones case that President Clinton raped nursing-home administrator JuanitaBroaddrick in a hotel room in Little Rock, Ark., when he was the state'sattorney general 20 years ago.            The paperprinted a letter Monday from exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda, whowrote from Falls Church, Va., that Clinton "must accept primary responsibility"for the world's inaction in the face of the genocide in his country. Referringto the president's promise of $30 million to help bring the guilty to trial,the king said that this might help salve Clinton's conscience but that "mypeople need, and deserve, more than this if they are to rebuild their lives,which would not have been shattered had he acted sooner."            In Argentina, the Buenos Aires Heraldblamed the Arkansas schoolyard massacre on the proliferation of firearms in theUnited States and said in an editorial that Argentine citizens were alsorapidly arming themselves as a reaction to a surging crime rate. "Yet massivelybuying weapons in self-defence only leads to a dangerous escalation ofviolence," it said.            United NationsSecretary-General Kofi Annan said in an interview Monday with the conservativeParis daily Le Figarothat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was "very intelligent and young"and understood international situations. "He is a man fully capable ofsurprising us in a positive way," Annan said.
