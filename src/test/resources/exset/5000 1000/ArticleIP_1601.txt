                                 Growing Pains                           That's My Boy ,produced by Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising for Adult Tylenol.            The strategy animatingThat's My Boy , produced by Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising for AdultTylenol, is simple: Capitalize on the clichd but timely football motif toappeal directly to the men among the 129 million viewers of the Super Bowlbroadcast. At the same time, reach out to women--who buy the pills and stockthe medicine cabinet--by cleverly deconstructing the macho stereotype so thatit becomes familiar, funny.            The idea seems to haveworked: The ad emerged as one of the Super Bowl broadcast's 10 most successful,according to USA Today 's people meter, a hand-held dial that registeredthe second-by-second reaction of a sample of 139 consumers. And it faredparticularly well with women, who placed it in the top five.            The spot opens with anoverweight father clearly looking to realize his old dreams vicariously throughhis son. Dad knows that the key to success lies in the early start he did notget, that only the savvy fledgling gets the worm. So he's willing to go to batfor his boy: "Now, we got a lot of work to do before the next game," he tellsthe perfectly--and expensively--attired aspirant. "But I'm with you." Hissupport, the son's almost weary "OK, Dad" suggests, is a dubious privilege.            The second scene shows Dadholding the ball for a place kick. The setting, complete with Norman Rockwellbackyard and white picket fence, is perfect. It invites nostalgia, stirsmemories of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet or, for parents born ageneration later, The Partridge Family , when ... ouch ! Junior'smighty kick makes sharp contact with Dad's foot.            Undaunted, theself-appointed coach keeps his post, showing his charge how to throw the ball,then going out for a pass. "I'm open," he yells. Sure he is--there's no oneelse on the field. But wait--here's a hedge, scourge of theless-than-fleet-of-foot. Awkward, klutzy, Dad trips. As before, it's the fatherwho's been hurt, the son who expresses concern. "Dad, you OK?" The father'sresponse ("Yeah, fine," when he's clearly not) and the next two scenes (aflurry of action, then a shot of him flat on his face) suddenly clarify thespot's real target. It's the woman, of course, who, seeing her own frustratedsportsman in the prone figure on the field, smiles as she turns up the dial onthe ad meter. She knows that Dad will try something he shouldn't, that he willstub his toe, that he will complain, and that she will have to give himsomething to stop the pain.            The rout continues, ablind-side tackle eliciting a wheezy "Nice tackle, son," followed by a close-upof the clearly pumped-up kid. The duo runs toward us, with Dad puffing,struggling to keep up, then finally gesturing for a timeout. We get acommercial break within the commercial, the voice-over telling us that "thebest moments in life sometimes come with a few aches and pains." A shot of theTylenol box and a glass of water accompanies the first mention of the product.The contrast with past aspirin and Tylenol ads is striking. No pain-wrackedheadache sufferers here. No irradiative blue waves pulsating to pounding music.This is a happy ad for a pain reliever so effective that, as we see in the nextscenes, it can help you smile through a broken arm.            And for all the kidding he'staken, Dad gets his payoff. The scene moves to the real world of real playersand real coaches, and our footballer, still wearing his No. 11 jersey, seems tobe holding his own: "Your little guy's looking pretty good out there," says anapproving coach. The dad is studiously blas: "Yeah, well," he says. "We'vebeen practicing."            The gameover, father and son walk away from us, satisfied. The little guy in the bigshirt gets a pat on the head from Dad: "Hey, that was a good game, buddy." TheTylenol name appears at the bottom of the screen in a strong but unobtrusivered. A perfect end to a perfect day. Dad's been injured, sure, but his pride isintact, his love for his son papering over his shortcomings as a coach. Mom'sstill smiling, struck by the warmth and familiarity of this scene--and, the admakers hope, she's still turning up the dials and buying up the Tylenol.                           --RobertShrum
