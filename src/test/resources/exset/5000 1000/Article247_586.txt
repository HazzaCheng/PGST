                                 Shakti Waves            Nuclear proliferation is the story of the day. Pakistan's possible imminenttest of a nuclear bomb leads at USA Today, and the Washington Post, and is also the subject of a Wall Street Journal piece tipped high in the paper's front-pagenews box. The confirmation by experts that last week India detonated a hydrogenbomb leads at the New York Times. And the Los Angeles Timesgoes with the Group of Eight's struggle to devise a nuclear strategy.            Pakistan's foreign minister said Sunday that despite appeals from PresidentClinton and other world leaders, his government has decided to conduct anuclear test, reports USAT , the NYT and the WSJ . And thisis what the USAT and WSJ headlines say. But the papers alsoreport that others in the government say the decision has not been made yet.WP quotes Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had just leftPakistan, as saying that his delegation left believing the Pakistanis werestill undecided. The LAT sums up the situation with its off-leadheadline "Pakistan Sends Mixed Signals." President Clinton is quoted byUSAT saying that a Pakistan test is "a nutty way to go." The G-8 summitrefused to follow Clinton's lead and impose sanctions against India, reportsUSAT , instead issuing a resolution condemning its nuclear testing. TheLAT calls this a "toothless statement."            Meanwhile, according to USAT and the NYT , India ratcheted thesituation with its announcement that its nuclear missile program is all butready. The Times explains this means the country now has a nuke that canbe delivered from a plane, or launched from the ground or the sea. According toIndian scientists, says the NYT , the hydrogen bomb (code-named Shakti-1,from the Hindi word for "power") they set off is considerably smaller than thelargest hydrogen bombs tested by the U.S., Russia and the other establishednuclear powers. The Indians say they kept their bomb "small" to avoid damage tonearby populated villages. One Indian scientist quoted by the Times saysof larger bombs, "If there is a demand, we will do it." An American experttells the paper that Indian claims about having exploded a hydrogen bomb andbeing able to explode bigger ones is quite believable. The Times saysWestern experts have known that Pakistan could build an atomic bomb, but aren'tsure about a hydrogen bomb.            As with its reporting on the original Indian announcement of the tests lastweek, the Times captures the national pride they have inspired, afeeling the paper likens to the way we felt about our original astronauts.Cheers were heard, for instance, on the videotape of last Monday's blasts.            Sunday's NYT front ran a Jeff Gerth/David Sanger piece reporting atlength on what was suggested in Friday's Gerth piece on the Chinese/DNCconnection: that the Chinese monies paved the way for President Clinton'sapproval of the export of satellite technology to China. In today'sTimes , USAT and the WP , Clinton is quoted, "All theforeign policy decisions we made were based on what we believed...were in thebest interests of the American people." In his column today, William Safirecalls Clinton the "Proliferation President," arguing that his willingness toexport the technology strengthened China's satellite and missile technology,which scared India into joining the nuclear club, which scared Pakistan, whichChina can now aid with advanced missile weaponry.            In a WP op-ed, budget analyst Scott Hodge takes a look at the $200billion highway bill, which, critics claim, is full of gold-plated projects.Actually, argues Hodge, it's worse than that: it would be far cheaper--lessthan half the cost--if the entire Interstate Highway System was justgold-plated.            According to information in Sunday's NYT "Week in Review," there'sone respect in which India has no peer in the nuclear club: Almost half abillion of its citizens don't have toilets.
