                                 What the Net Hath Wrought                        Dear Joe,            Well, I guess we probably will not ever agree. But I only need to use yourexamples as proof that what the Internet has wrought in an unbelievably shorttime has been profound--the entire computer industry (as evidenced by MichaelDell's success) has been turned on its ear, the retail industry is reeling (didyou see the many news stories today about Nordstrom's striking a deal with awell-known Silicon Valley venture firm to jumpstart its Web efforts?), andtraditional media companies are in full-scale alert.            Consider the daily impact of AOL, which has risen from obscurity to disdainto prominence in only five years. I think you don't even have to take a poll ofAmerica's top execs to get them to agree that they think this company is animportant one these days. Consider its rivals as the best indicator--right now,both Microsoft and AT&T have painted a big red target on AOL and are takingaim on multiple fronts.            And why is this? Because, finally, after all those years of promises, theinteractive age is upon us. I used to joke that the idea of interactivetelevision has been around since I had been a fetus, but that it never seemedto work. Now, pretty much every major communications company is formulatingplans to shove a fully loaded digital set-top box into America's living roomsto move interactive services from the computer to the television--or any devicein the house, really. Did you hear about the Internet refrigerator that linksto grocery sites? Of course, I am probably the only one who thinks this is agood idea. It's clear to me that either via a plethora of wires or satellite orwireless means, we are all going to be plugged in more than ever before in thecoming years. I myself am a cell phone freak, who cannot imagine being withoutmy little Nokia 6160. Relying on cell phones completely, I had even abandonedland-line phones from the local telephone provider until I was recently forcedto link up again to get high-speed Internet access over telephones. I used tobe mocked for my cell addiction, but now I am regularly sought after for adviceon just which plan to get.            But to a bigger point, we should all think about what this means to societyand its citizens on a more personal level. For this, I turn to an article inthe New York Times today about an outbreak of syphilis in San Franciscobeing linked to one chat room on AOL. Apparently, six men who have contractedthe disease have said they met those partners offline after meeting incyberspace first. To say nothing of the idea that the Internet is replacing thebar as the best place to hook up, the Times asked the more pertinentquestion: "When does the right to online privacy yield to public healthissues?" The big problem is that most of the men knew their infected partnersonly by their AOL screen names. And AOL, which can identify these customers,was not giving out the real names.            I would be curious what you think of this and perhaps about the broaderissues of so much personal information sloshing around about Internet users.The medium is really a marketer's dream, giving them the ability to glean a lotof highly specific information about people and their habits. A dozen companiesand more to come are focused solely on recording and interpreting userpatterns.            It also cuts both ways. Several missives ago, you did hit on a good pointabout the Internet's being important in giving consumers perfect knowledgeabout products and, most important, prices. This is another big idea to me andone that I have been waiting to happen for a long time. I was a retail reporterfor seven years before I started covering the Internet, and my one majorconclusion from the job was that retailers hate customers. Any new system thatallows a consumer to take back some of the power that is rightfully theirs tobegin with--it is their money, after all--is one I will backimmediately. I am particularly taken with the new sites called "demand-driven"retail. In this system, people ask for what they want and the retailers respondrather than being told what they like and don't like. But is there some problemwith this? Will, for example, there eventually be a site dedicated solely toJoe Nocera and his needs? And, dare I ask, what would be on it?            Cheers,Kara
