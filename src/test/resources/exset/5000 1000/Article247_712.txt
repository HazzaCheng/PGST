                                 Don't Fire Till You See the Whites of Their Izods            Everybody leads with the House Judiciary vote to propose to the full Housean impeachment inquiry targeting President Clinton. The headlines at theWashington Post and the New York Timesmention that the vote to do so was along strict party lines (Republicans votingyes, Democrats voting no), while USA Today and the Los AngelesTimes relegate this news to the small print.            The WP says the proceedings were a "sober" debate, weighted by "thegravity of the moment." The LAT sees a "heated session," but one thatwas "filled with history lessons" and at times resembled a "law schooltutorial." USAT notes much "partisan quarreling," while the NYTsees a debate that ranged "from sober constitutional discourse to bitterpartisan scrapping."            As had been tipped in earlier press accounts, the papers report that themajority counsel David Schippers outlined 15 possible grounds for impeachment,which augmented Ken Starr's list with new charges of conspiracy to obstructjustice and concealing knowledge of false testimony, replaced talk of perjurywith talk of making false statements, and dropped talk of abuse of power. Andminority counsel Abbe Lowell described all this as a "laundry list" falling farshort of the standards for impeachment. According to the papers, the ensuingdiscussion by committee members sometimes grasped for the imprimatur ofWatergate. The NYT and LAT note that Rep. Bob Barr used JohnDean's hallowed "cancer on the Presidency" line to describe Bill Clinton'sbehavior. (But several papers also quote Rep. Lindsey Graham's question: "Isthis Watergate or Peyton Place?") The WP points out that the resolutionpassed yesterday was almost word-for-word identical to the one that launchedthe Nixon impeachment inquiry in 1974. By the way, it's USAT that makesit clear that this unrestricted resolution means any subsequent impeachmentinquiry might include an investigation of Clinton's 1996 campaignfund-raising.            And the LAT notes how media-infested the whole process has become,noting that the day started with members' appearances on the morning talkshows, and that at one point during committee debate, one congressman toldanother, he'd respond to him later on--when the two were on "Crossfire."            There's a curious ellipsis in the WP when it quotes RepublicanRep. Bill McCollum arguing that impeachment is not obviously too harsh for whatthe President did. The paper leaves out the part in the middle where McCollummentioned the exact number of people in prison today (over a hundred) becausethey lied to a grand jury or in federal court. Why the little dotstreatment?            But in an inside piece, the WP does efficiently paint a Bill's-eye view of the world right now: There could beU.S. military action in Kosovo within days. There could be a governmentshutdown by the end of the week. The world's top financial officials are intown looking for money and solutions for the global economic crisis, and by theway, the House of Representatives will probably vote Thursday to begin animpeachment inquiry. Jeez, just typing all those sentences makes Today's Paperswant to escape into phone sex.            A column in last Sunday's NYT noted the concomitant rise of churchmarketing and spiritual business consulting, and now comes the Wall Street Journal "Work Week" column reporting that withunemployment low, some companies are recruiting at churches. Manpower Inc. even gives churches adonation for each congregation member placed.            The LAT 's "Column One" details an unheralded breakthrough in U.S.military equipment. For the first time ever, a service branch--the MarineCorps--is buying boots that were designed for civilians. This is a departurefrom the prior practice of going out to civilian manufacturers and telling themhow to make a combat boot. The Matterhorn footwear by Cove Shoe Co. is lighter,cooler, more shock-absorbent and water-resistant than its traditionalpredecessor. What's more, notes the LAT , since Cove's brand-name labelis stamped on the heel, the next time Marines are ordered in harm's way, theywill become the first troops ever to go into combat in designer footwear.            The WSJ story about Motorola's third quarter performance runs underthe headline: "Motorola Operating Net Tops Estimates As Firm Benefits FromRestructuring." The WP story on the same subject is headlined "MotorolaPosts Loss for Third Quarter."
