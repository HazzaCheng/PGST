                                 The Trouble With German Nationalism                        If British telecom giant Vodafone succeeds in its attempted hostile takeoverof German telecom giant Mannesmann, the deal will be, by some measures, thebiggest deal in history (non-inflation, non-bull-market-adjusted, that is). Andit will also be a crucial step in turning Europe into what it's supposedly wellon its way to becoming: a unified economic region.            Great Britain has refused to become part of the euro currency zone, sothere's something ironic about a British company serving as the avatar ofglobalization, European-style. Nonetheless, it is as precisely that kind ofavatar that Mannesmann's management and workers are treating Vodafone. Evenallowing for the fact that companies trying to resist hostile takeovers willsay and do almost anything to make their would-be acquirers look bad, theGerman reaction to the Vodafone offer has been striking for its vehemence andthe nakedness of its nationalism. Political leaders, union leaders, andcorporate leaders alike have all publicly attacked the deal as effectivelyBritish imperialism.            This is not, on some level, exactly surprising. Until this year, after all,nearly all European countries had regulations requiring pension funds to investmost of their assets in companies based in their own countries. And Olivetti'ssuccessful takeover of Telecom Italia this year was made possible in part bythe fact that Telecom Italia's attempted defense against the takeover involveda prospective merger with Deutsche Telekom, a merger that would have beenunacceptable to the Italian government. In any case, it's not as if the UnitedStates has no experience with this sort of thing, as evidenced by the hysteriaoccasioned by Japanese companies' acquisitions of properties like RockefellerCenter and Columbia Pictures in the late 1980s and early 1990s. (Of course,since only huge inflows of foreign capital now allow us to fund ourcurrent-accounts deficit, we should be thankful, not angry, that foreigninvestors want to put their money here.)            Still, the fight over Mannesmann seems especially ironic. In the firstplace, German companies have been among the most aggressive of global acquirersin recent years, both in the United States and Europe. Daimler has boughtChrysler, Bertelsmann has acquired a host of media and publishing properties,Deutsche Bank bought Bankers Trust, and the list goes on. That's why, for allthe bluster, you probably won't see the German government actually taking anypolitical action to block the deal. And it's also why Germans should get overthe knee-jerk reaction that any foreign takeover necessarily means terriblethings for a German company.            The other factor that should be at play here, but doesn't seem to be, is therecognition that foreign competition, whether in the direct form of competitionfor consumers or the more indirect form of competition for corporate control,is a very good thing, at least if we can take any lessons from the Americanexperience. Most of those Japanese acquisitions were complete bombs, but thenmost acquisitions fail. The pressure created by those acquisitions, though, wasa good thing (as, in retrospect, the pressure created by the corporate raidersof the 1980s was).            Mannesmann is not exactly a fat and happy corporation run by sleepymanagers. It has turned in a strong performance this decade. But when Vodafoneoffers 240 euros a share for a stock that had been trading at 160 euros a shareand Mannesmann managers say that the offer is an insult, it makes you wonderwhether those managers really understand what shareholder value means. And italso makes you think that they may be looking after their own interests morethan the company's. The impulse to rally to the flag may be understandable inthe face of an offer like Vodafone's. But from an economic perspective, it's animpulse that should be resisted.
