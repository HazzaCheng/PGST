                                 Dialing for Deals                           USAToday , the Washington Post , and the New York Timesall lead with the latest developments in the investigation of PresidentClinton's fund-raising. The Los Angeles Times can't even find room for that onits front page and leads instead with the historic Belfast meeting of BritishPrime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Republican political leader GerryAdams.                           USAT says that the Justice Department task force investigatingClinton's phone calls is recommending that Janet Reno take no action in thatmatter. Reno's spokesman, the paper reports, says his boss hasn't made adecision yet. (She could, besides ending the investigation, also continuelooking into it, or ask a court to name an independent counsel.) USATquotes Clinton as saying that "I have gone out of my way to have noconversation with her about this or, frankly, anything else." In their leadstories, both the WP and NYT have Clinton adding, "...which I'mnot sure is so good." The additional observation seems right and newsworthy.Wonder why USAT left it out.            The WP leads with the news that Clinton is willing to be interviewedby Justice for this investigation. And the paper quotes Clinton in reaction toReno's recent statement that she was 'mad' about the White House's lag on thecoffee tapes: "You should have been there when I heard about it." (TheNYT has this too.)            The NYT goes further, saying the White House and the JusticeDepartment are in fact negotiating an agreement under which President Clintonwould answer questions about his knowledge of Democratic re-electionfund-raising efforts. The interviews would not, says the Times , beconducted by Reno, but by lower-level prosecutors. This deal is being workedout, because, the NYT says, citing "law enforcement officials" anddisagreeing with USAT , the phone calls investigation will probably goforward.            The Post story includes this explanation for why the White HouseCommunications Agency, "a military unit that provides the president with securecommunications," originally didn't produce the coffee tapes: the WHCA's chiefof staff got the full memo requesting any such videos, but when he put it intoan e-mail format to send it to his boss, the agency's director, he accidentallyomitted the first two pages. The paper quotes Clinton saying he doesn't blamethe WHCA. But why isn't Clinton or the WP at all concerned that theoffice responsible for providing the president with "secure communications"can't email a memo without losing the first two pages?            The LAT leads with a "gesture of peace so fraught with controversythat it was made behind closed doors," namely, the handshake yesterday inBelfast between Blair and Adams. The meeting lasted but ten minutes, and was,the LAT reports, immediately assailed by Protestant hard-liners as aninsult to the victims of IRA terrorism. The paper reports that Blair laterwould not confirm that the handshake occurred, and that he had arranged that nopictures were taken of it. The history of such handshakes suggests that suchcaution is not crazy. Think Gandhi. Think Sadat. Think Rabin.            The NYT states and powerfully describes a new division among peoplewith AIDS--that between those who can afford the powerful new medications likeprotease inhibitors that promise to transform AIDS from a fatal to a merelychronic disease, and those who cannot. The story reports that the federal-statepartnership that pays for AIDS drugs for the indigent is broke in 26 states. Asa result, poor people with AIDS often simply go without.            The Wall Street Journal 's "Work Week" column notes that foremployees who like to surf the Internet at work, Tripod Inc.'s Web site has a"panic button" for use when the boss shows up. Press it and the screen suddenlyswitches to a nominating form for "Boss of the Year." Through much arduousresearch, this column has discovered a more subtle variant: A Triple-X siteoperating from Los Angeles has a panic button that instantly kicks over to theCNN Web site.
