                                 McGwire Stories            The New York Timesleads with Janet Reno's decision to launch an inquiry into whether or notduring his 1996 re-election bid, President Clinton coordinated an "issue"advertising campaign that was in fact an improper attempt to circumvent federallimits on his own campaign ad budget. The story also gets major play on theWashington Post front, but is not on the Los AngelesTimes front, and is just barely reefered at USA Today .The Post goes with President Clinton's attempts to marshal congressionalsupport for the coming storm. The LAT leads with the Dow's biggest 1-daypoint gain ever, which is the off-lead at the WP , and is also fronted atUSAT and the NYT . USAT gives over three-quarters of itsfront page to Mark McGwire's record-breaking 62nd home run, a story that alsocops mega column-inchage at the LAT and NYT , but which is missingaltogether--due to deadline constraints, no doubt--from the front of the firstavailable edition of the WP . McGwire is widely quoted thanking hisfamily, his son, the Cubs, and Sammy Sosa. The NYT reports that beforethe game, he rubbed Roger Maris' record-setting bat on his body.            The NYT and the WP note that Reno's newest inquiry is the third different DOJ look at aWhite House operation initiated in the past two weeks. Although, notes theNYT , this one's more personal, naming Clinton as the principal subject.Reno has, explains the paper, reviewed the issue ad issue at least three timesbefore, but each time stopped after an initial 30-day review. Both papersreport what has been widely suggested in recent days--that a Federal ElectionCommission report helped persuade her to look again. And both report a WhiteHouse lawyer's comment that the vexed ads were carefully previewed by lawyers.The WP entices with the tidbit that the Dole '96 campaign ads are alsounder review at Justice, but at an earlier stage of review. (Why isn't it asfar along? The paper doesn't say.)            The WP lead and NYT front report that Kenneth Starr is likelyto deliver his report to Congress as early as the end of this week, probablysooner than the White House expected. Well-placed lawyers talking to theTimes tell the paper that the report is likely to say that PresidentClinton lied under oath in his Jones case deposition and to includeembarrassing descriptions of Clinton's conduct with Monica Lewinsky. TheWP lead and the NYT report that Clinton is scrambling to marshalDemocratic congressional support, with advisors reporting that he is going toapologize at a meeting with House Democrats today. He may also, says theTimes , apologize later this week at a White House prayer breakfast. ThePost reports that at a Tuesday appearance at an elementary school,Clinton seemed subdued.            The LAT off-lead is the confession by long-time Yeltsin advisor,Anatoly Chubais, that Russia "conned" the international community out of nearly$20 billion in loans by hiding the severity of the country's fiscal problems.If the government had told the truth, Chubais is quoted as saying, the Russianeconomy would have collapsed last spring and lenders "would have stoppeddealing with us forever."            For once, have some pity on the Corrections folks at the NYT . Today,they were somehow forced to run this one: "An article in Arts & Ideas onAug. 29 about the changing role of the audience in political theater misstatedthe name of a theater institute at Harvard and the title of its leader. It isthe Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue (not "for" Arts), and the writerand actress Anna Deveare Smith is its director, not artistic director."            According to the Wall Street Journal "Tax Report," just about everybody inofficial Washington stood up Tuesday to denounce the idea reported earlier inthe week that the IRS would impose the gift tax on any fan who tried to give ahistoric home run ball back to the slugger who launched it. Presidentialspokesman Mike McCurry is quoted saying the idea was "about the dumbest thingI've ever heard in my life." (And think of all the dumb things he gets tohear.) Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan dashed off a letter of complaint to thecommissioner of the IRS, and another senator blasted the commissioner over thephone. The IRS quickly issued a statement making it clear that the fan wouldnot owe gift tax. The one problem with all this: despite the apparent oddity ofthe home run ball case, not one of these horrified public servants has shownwhy it isn't a perfectly straightforward application of the gift tax. Soshouldn't they rethink the whole idea? (Look for a WSJ editorial to makethis point any day now.)
