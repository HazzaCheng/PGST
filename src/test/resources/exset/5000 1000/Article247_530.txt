                                 McCain Mutiny                           USAToday , the Washington Post , and the New York Timeslead with the failure in the Senate of the Feingold-McCain campaign reformbill, which would have barred the national political parties from traffickingin "soft money." The Los Angeles Times goes with the federal indictment of eightCalifornia corrections officials suspected of conspiracy and cover-up inconnection with various improprieties concerning inmates, including asuspicious death.            The Feingold-McCain defeat came Thursday at the hands of a Republican-ledfilibuster. This was, in the words of USAT , "nearly a replay" of thebill's fate last fall. The repetitive outcome, showed, says the paper, that ayear of publicity about the excesses of political fund-raising had "failed tochange a single senator's mind."            The bills' opponents, led by Sen. Trent Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, arguethat new fund-raising limitations amount to an infringement on free speech. ButMcConnell gives away the game in telling the NYT that three groups thatprovide what he calls "valuable grass-roots support" (=soft money) had stronglyopposed the reform bill. The three: the National Rifle Association, theChristian Coalition, and the National Right to Life Committee. The Timesgoes on to point out that while for the past year, Senate Republicans had putthe spotlight on President Clinton's more unseemly fund-raising efforts, theyhave fiercely resisted any legislative fix that would cancel their fund-raisingadvantage, which USAT spells out: $40.2 million in soft money, comparedto the Democrats' $33.3 million. The WP and NYT both report thatDemocrats intend to run on the issue in the fall congressional elections.Everybody quotes Sen. John McCain's reason for believing that eventually,public pressure for change will increase: "There will be more scandals, moreindictments and more people going to jail."            There's another LAT front-page story about jail abuses: the L.A. CitySheriff's department is investigating the possibility that beatings of accusedchild molesters were allegedly encouraged by deputies working in the men'scentral jail and resulted in at least one homicide.            Meanwhile, the NYT reports that the federal government on Thursdayformally took over the prosecution of police officers implicated in the brutalattack last summer on Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. Conviction on the federalcivil rights charges could mean sentences of up to life in prison. The fiveofficers charged pleaded not guilty and remain free on bond.            The same picture of a jubilant Oprah Winfrey celebrating a federal jury'sfinding of no liability in her mad cow trial runs on the fronts of each of thefour dailies that use photos. The caption and headline writers join the fun:"Jurors: no beef with Oprah" ( USAT ), "Savoring Victory" ( LAT ) and"Next On Oprah: Freedom Of Speech" ( WP ).            The lead NYT editorial observes that Washington is now"enthralled by the idea that James Bond methods can remove Saddam Hussein frompower," and points out that a tonic for that idea is found in the recentlyreleased internal CIA report about the Bay of Pigs failure. Both cases, saysthe Times , represent overly optimistic expectations that entrencheddictators can be toppled by small acts of insurrection.            The Wall Street Journal reports that HarperCollins, owned byRupert Murdoch, was to have published the memoirs of Chris Patten, last Britishgovernor of Hong Kong, but the two have parted company. The paper quotes peoplefamiliar with the situation as saying that Murdoch had balked at printingpassages critical of the Chinese government. The WSJ points out thatMurdoch has a track record of using his media empire to advance his interestsin China. For instance, in 1994, his News Corp. dropped the BBC from thecollection of channels it beams into China because the Chinese didn't like theBBC program on Mao.            The WP 's "Reliable Source" column says that yesterday, reporterscovering the Food and Drug Administration received an official e-mail from theFDA press office that was.a long list of Clinton sex jokes. (We're assumingabout, not by.) The agency is "looking into it."            According to the USAT "Snapshot," fully 62 percent of members of theU.S. college class of 2001--which the paper notes, includes ChelseaClinton--would not ever consider doing what either of their parents do for aliving.
