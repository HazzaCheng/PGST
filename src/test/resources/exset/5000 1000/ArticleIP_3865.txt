RightWing, Wrong Neck                        In"If At FirstYou Don't Secede," Alex Heard should have used the term "redneck" insteadof "right-wing." It is unfair to lump a bunch of wackos in with those who arejust politically conservative. The new "Republicans of Texas" aregun-brandishing "rednecks" with an attitude. I grew up in the Southwesternstate of Oklahoma and have seen others of the same type. As a conservative, Ithink we need to revise government and the general posturing of the BATF, FBI,and CIA, but I know people will pay for misuse of authority eventually, and Ithink there are other ways to fix our problems without stupidity injected intothe debate. Those "rednecks" don't represent my part of the politicalspectrum.            -- Pastor Lew EverettLewis Maysey III                                       Kooks.Cranks. Loons.                        I was offended by thelanguage employed by Alex Heard in "If At First You Don'tSecede," his portrait of the participants in the Republic of Texasmovement. With an insouciant and supercilious tone, he employed descriptorssuch as "trailer-trash," "redneck," "codger," "nut," "fringe," and the rest ofthat all-too-familiar list.            Theundereducated, lower-middle-class white Southern males comprise the onlyidentifiable class of people in our country that can still be insulted withimpunity in today's politically correct society. What if, instead of whitefolk, Heard had attended a gathering of Hispanics, Muslims, radical feminists,or even ordinary-grade media liberals? He would never have used analogous termsto describe them.            -- Tito Perdue                                       Cops asRobbers                        Akhil Reed Amar made adisturbing comment in his dialogue with Alan Dershowitz on "Truth and Crime." Incriticizing the ability of the exclusionary rule to reverse a conviction, hewrote: "The wrong done was the search, not the conviction. Yet the exclusionaryrule in effect rewards B with just such a windfall by sparing him from theconviction."            Amarfails to grasp the purpose of the reversal. It is not a reward for the criminalbut a punishment for the prosecutor. It is very important in our imperfectjustice system that the police and prosecutors do not get the idea that theends justify the means. As it stands now, police officers, especially in urbanareas, present more illegally obtained evidence than legally obtained evidence.They justify their actions with the fact that the men and women whose civilrights they routinely violate are involved in criminal activity, and thereforehave no rights. However, this indicates that law enforcement is convictingbefore trying and is ignoring the fact that in performing illegal searches,they themselves are criminals. I would encourage a reinterpretation of theexclusionary principle to keep criminals in jail where they belong, but only ifthe cops and prosecutors are severely punished for their crimes as well.            -- MarkHoofnagle                                       BookRevue                        It was clear in "Z." that WalterKirn had made up his mind about the book Mason & Dixon before hepicked it up. Kirn doesn't like Thomas Pynchon and doesn't like the kind ofnovel Pynchon writes. Nor does he have anything interesting to say about why hedoesn't like them.            You might as well picksomebody to review a Picasso retrospective who never liked all that Cubiststuff in the first place (too hard to look at), or have somebody who thinksrock music is just screeching write about Alanis Morissette. The reviewer oughtto consider whether the work succeeds on its own terms.            To saynothing of how, somehow, it's not only OK but cool to say, "Hey, I didn't evenread the book in the first place," as if we could really infer the book isunreadable from that. This, I guess, is Slate's self-chosen role, the forum forthose who can't really be bothered to try.
