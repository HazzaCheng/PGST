                                 Razing Arizona            On a typical news day, the felony conviction of a sitting governor is newsleader stuff, as is the Department of Justice's decision to look into the VicePresident's fund-raising practices. But when these stories break on the sameday, and under the pall of the sudden death of a princess who was probably oneof the most famous people on the planet, everything changes.            The LosAngeles Times leads with the conviction yesterday of Arizona Gov. FifeSymington on seven counts of fraud having to do with his business practices asa real estate developer. The paper explains that the verdict means thatSymington must resign immediately, and also probably means lots of jail time.The LAT points out, referring to former Governor Evan Meacham, thatSymington thus becomes the state's second governor in a decade to be ousted.But the Washington Post is a little stronger on context, pointingout that Symington was a major player in the impeachment and removal fromoffice of Meacham. The Post and the New York Timesalso note that Meacham, while impeached under a criminal cloud, was eventuallyacquitted of the charges against him. The WP adds that, in this century,eleven governors have been indicted while in office and six have been convictedor pleaded guilty. The NYT observes that Symington is the third governorin the 1990s to be forced from office because of a conviction.            Yesterday's WP revealed that more than $120,000 of the money Al Goreraised in those phone calls from his White House office ended up in an accountfor "hard money" subject to federal election laws, and today's Postleads with the news that this has prompted Janet Reno to authorize the initialstages of an investigation into Gore's fund-raising that could result in aspecial prosecutor being named in the matter. The Gore phone call controversywas first broken last winter by the WP , but yesterday in their storieson this latest development, neither the LAT nor USA Today(which placed it prominently: front page, column six, above the fold) couldbring themselves to acknowledge this. The former states that the cause ofReno's action was "news" and the latter goes with "accusations."            The Di story has shifted into thumbsucking mode. USAT , theNYT , the WP , and the LAT all have front pagers today abouthow the British royal family appears to have underestimated the publicaffection for Di and the papers worry that, as a result, the royals may neveragain enjoy true mass appeal.            It's bad enough that we had to take Yakov Smirnoff, but now comes word fromthe WP that retired Soviet espionage ace Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin isseeking a green card. The trouble is that Kalugin helped plan the kidnapping ofNicholas Shadrin, a former Soviet naval officer who was a highly-valued doubleagent for the CIA. And not only did Shadrin die in Kalugin's custody(accidentally, he says) but Kalugin helped create the cover story that kept theCIA from finding out what really happened to Shadrin for many years. A numberof retired CIA operatives are very unhappy about Kalugin's effort to gainpermanent residence status and want to know why the CIA would help him getit.            The LAT reports that a growing number of members of Congress arecoming to the view that the proposed $368.5 billion tobacco settlement is toobig and too complicated to be enacted by Congress this year. Nobody's saying soyet, but there are four little words that should come to mind with this news:Clinton health care plan. On that one too, there was great initial enthusiasm,followed by earnest pronouncements that more time was needed, followed by aslow legislative death. The only difference would be that this time, it's theforces of reform that might well harness the traditional mechanisms for gummingup the works. Don't be surprised if David Kessler and C. Everett Koop becomethis season's Harry and Louise.
