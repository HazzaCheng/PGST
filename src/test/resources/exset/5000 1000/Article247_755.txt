                                 Saddam Goes Solo            The intensifying showdown with Iraq leads at the Washington Post , Los AngelesTimes , New York Times , and USA Today . As the U.S.increased its bomber presence in the Persian Gulf, the total isolation ofSaddam Hussein became apparent. Yesterday Egypt, Syria, and six other Gulfcountries signed a declaration that blamed the crisis on Iraq's intransigence.Even France and Russia--which traditionally have supported Iraq's argument thatsanctions should be lifted--have voiced no opposition to a possible U.S.attack.            U.S. rhetoric was sharp: Defense Secretary William Cohen warned thatmilitary strikes, if they occur, "will be significant." Deputy Secretary ofState Strobe Talbott said, "We have thought well beyond Hour One and Day Oneand Week One." In Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz reiteratedIraq's stance that sanctions should be lifted before weapons inspectors arereinstated. Aziz did indicate, however, that Iraq would welcome U.N.intervention--but Kofi Annan, who has been burned too many times by Iraq'sbroken promises, shows no inclination to head to Baghdad.            The LAT says that "an attack on Iraq, and possibly a massive one,"could come at "virtually any moment." The WP is more cautious, citingU.S. officials who say that "military action is not likely for 10 days,although it could come sooner." Possible reasons for delay include PresidentClinton's upcoming swing through Asia and a last chance for diplomacy.            The Wall StreetJournal fronts a story on how E.W. Scripps Co., owner of Home andGarden Television, broke into the "clubby" and expensive cable programmingbusiness--in which would-be programmers must even pay cable systems for channelspace. Scripps essentially got lucky--after stumbling on the concept of using"retransmission rights" as a bargaining chip--and its boomer-friendly contenttook off, once aired. Nonetheless, Scripps had no free rise: It initially hadto promise 25% of its ad revenue to cable operators.            A nerve-racking USAT "Cover Story"says that airports nationwide, in an effort to accommodate more traffic andincrease runway efficiency, are practicing "the simultaneous use ofintersecting runways." One jet could be taking off and another landing onintersecting runways; it is presumed that the landing jet will stop well beforethe intersection. Though a number of near-misses have been reported, the FAAwants to extend the practice to flights at night and in the rain.            The NYT and LAT front stories on the $433 million lawsuitagainst the gun industry filed yesterday by the city of Chicago. The suitcharges that stores in Chicago's suburbs knowingly overstocked guns, confidentthat they would be distributed to illegal outlets, and that the gun industryconstitutes a "public nuisance"--that is, by enabling illegal gun sales, itincreased the burden on Chicago's civic services. The lawsuit, reminiscent ofthe fight against Big Tobacco, may serve as a model for upcoming suits inPhiladelphia, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.            In a long NYT op-ed, Tony Blair writes deferentially of how"America is once again responding to the call of duty" in the Iraq crisis.Using the Iraq context as a springboard, Blair opines the U.S. shoulders toomuch responsibility for European and international affairs. Europe should bemore organized, he says. "America's trans-Atlantic commitment has made Europe asafer place. But Europe needs to do more to repay that debt."            Biotechnology grows ever more bizarre: A human skin cell nestled in a gutted cow egg turned into an embryoand divided--or so claims a small biotechnology company in Worcester,Massachusetts, according to a WP story. This extraordinary revelation,made public yesterday, has spawned questions not only about the legitimacy ofthe results, but also about possible misuse of federal funds. If the experimentis true, its implications are so surreal that they bear repeating: The firsthuman embryo may have been cloned--with the aid of a cow egg.
