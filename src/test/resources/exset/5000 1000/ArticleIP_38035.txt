DirectorMartin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader--who collaborated on TaxiDriver , Raging Bull , and others--team up again, this time for afilm about a burned-out New York ambulance driver played by Nicolas Cage.Critics respond with a sprinkling of hearty positive reviews, but the majorityare gingerly worded negative takes. Almost everyone draws parallels to TaxiDriver (another Manhattanite on the edge driving an automobile), thoughnobody says it compares favorably. David Ansen does call it "superbly shot ...full of bravura moments and high-wire performances" ( Newsweek ), andRoger Ebert raves that "it contains some of [Scorsese's] most brilliantsequences" ( Chicago Sun-Times ). Overall, though, the reviews complainthat the film feels too familiar and short on plot. (David Edelstein the filmin                   Slate               .)                                             The Best Man                (Universal Pictures). The first filmfrom director Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lee's cousin) gets lukewarm reviews, butmoviegoers still made it No. 1 at the box office last week. The story focuseson a group of college buddies reunited for a wedding, which makes it "a kind ofBig Chill for black folks" (Lonnae O'Neal Parker, the WashingtonPost ). (A similar comment in Entertainment Weekly provoked anindignant letter to the editor from star Taye Diggs.) Several critics say it"does not deliver on what could have been a promising premise" (Bill Zwecker,Chicago Sun-Times ), but Newsweek 's David Ansen finds it "funny,sentimental, cheerfully bawdy."

AntonioBanderas' directorial debut--which stars his wife, Melanie Griffith--leavescritics cringing. Although Banderas directs "capably enough" (Janet Maslin, theNew York Times ), the plot is a dud. Twin stories follow a batty woman'sflight to Hollywood after killing her husband, and a young boy's firstencounters with racism; the two story lines link up at the end. "Of all thepatronizing white-witness movies made in Hollywood about the civil rightsmovement, this has to be the loopiest" (Steve Daly, EntertainmentWeekly ).

Books                                                         The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story               , by MichaelLewis (W.W. Norton & Co.). Positive responses to Lewis' ( Liar'sPoker ) inquiry into what makes Internet mogul Jim Clark--and all SiliconValley--tick. On the upside, the book is a ripsnorting read, and Lewis "has anatural talent for spinning hilarious scenes and uncovering wicked details"(Steven Levy, Newsweek ). As Michiko Kakutani writes in the New YorkTimes , "Lewis uses a sort of Tom Wolfe approach, enlivening his account ofcomplicated financial deals and even more complicated engineering feats withsnappy cameo portraits, exclamatory descriptions and lots of subjectivejudgments." Or as Joshua Quittner writes in Time , "sometimes I got thefeeling that Lewis so reveres his protagonist that he became his apologist."(Click to read                   Slate               's "Book Club" on The New NewThing .)                                             Personal Injuries               , by Scott Turow (Farrar Straus& Giroux). Excellent reviews for the lawyer-author's fifth novel, about amorally ambiguous attorney's collaboration with law enforcement to nail a groupof corrupt judges. It's "street savvy and emotionally rich" (R. Z. Sheppard,Time ); though "[l]egal fiction has turned depressingly formulaic andmelodramatic lately ... Turow's just gets richer and smarter" (Tom DeHaven,Entertainment Weekly ). Michiko Kakutani delivers one of the few downbeatreviews, claiming that the novel "imparts little of the insider's knowledge"that graced his other books and that "it lacks a fundamental sense of suspense"(the New York Times ).
