                                 Yeltsin and Out                           USAToday leads with chat-show declarations by Madeleine Albright andWilliam Cohen that the administration has opened a new war against terrorism.The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times go with President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of his maingovernment officers, including his prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, which isalso the off-lead at the Washington Post and USAT . The WP leads withNewt Gingrich's first extensive comments about Kenneth Starr's investigationsince The Speech, which include his declaration that impeachment would requirenot "a single human mistake" but "a pattern of felonies." Gingrich also tellsthe Post that he thinks Starr's report to Congress will probably be madeavailable to the public, but that the supporting evidence will be keptsecret.                           USAT accompanies its lead with a front-section "cover story" aboutthe newly announced U.S. war, which states that Osama bin Laden has alreadytrained "tens of thousands of terrorists operating in more than a dozencountries." Question: if this is so, then how is it that there was virtually nopress mention of bin Laden until the African embassy bombings? The piecereports that last week's strikes against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan werecode-named Operation Infinite Reach (which could have also been the code-namefor Clinton's Monica speech). The LAT front runs a story filed fromPakistan that includes an interview with a man who claims to have lived throughthe Tomahawk attacks on Afghanistan. "All of us were innocent," the man tellsthe paper, explaining that what the U.S. says is a terrorist training complexis in fact merely a religious education center.            The papers report that in the midst of his country's economic crisis,Yeltsin replaced the reform-minded Kiriyenko with Viktor Chernomyrdin. TheNYT says that it appears Yeltsin's thinking is that Chernomyrdin's goodrelations with financiers and with the Communists in Parliament may helpdeflate the widespread calls for his own departure. Everybody points out thatwhat makes the move odd is that Chernomyrdin already had the job for five yearsuntil last March, when Yeltsin let him go, in part because in the NYT 'swords, "a new young team was needed." The LAT and USAT sayanother reason was that Yeltsin had begun to fear Chernomyrdin as apresidential competitor. The papers report that despite the upheaval, theClinton White House says that President Clinton will still keep to a previouslyscheduled two-day summit with Yeltsin in Moscow early next month. Both theTimes and the LAT point out that the shake-up announcement wasmade on Russian television after the sports news.            The WP runs an interview with the Pope. At one point, when it ismentioned that the major growth in the Catholic Church is now taking placeoutside Europe and the United States, the pontiff replies, "It was so at thebeginning."            Being a celebrity often means you get for free what ordinary people have topay for, even though you can afford it and they can't. So for instance, TomCruise makes a movie and besides paying him, the studio throws him a Benz. Butit's not just the studios that are complicit. For years, the main column on thefront page of the LAT 's Sunday real estate section has been "HotProperty," which chronicles the real estate doings of the glitterati. Now, ifyou wanted to advertise your house for sale in the LAT , you'd have topay a hundred bucks or so for a tiny little buried ad, but if you're say (as inlast Sunday's paper), Pam Grier, why then at absolutely no cost to you thepaper leads the section with ten paragraphs about your house, including mentionof the neighborhood, the asking price and the names of the realtors tocontact.            It probably took a presidential sex confession and a transcontinental cruisemissile strike to keep today's Wall Street Journal 's front-page feature by Stephanie Mehtaout of the paper last week. The story? Cell-phones are getting smaller andlighter.
