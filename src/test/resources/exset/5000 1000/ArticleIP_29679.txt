                                  Death Stamps            Not content, apparently, with Oregon's pioneeringstatus as the first state to legalize physician-assisted suicide, the Oregonstate government has decided to be the first in the country to offerfinancially assisted suicide as well. Last year the state agency in charge ofdetermining Medicaid assistance for the poor included assisted suicide amongthe approved uses of the state's health-care dollars.            So, how much does it cost to kill yourself, anyway?Under the Oregon Death With Dignity Act you must consult with a physician and apsychiatric counselor before imbibing the $45 cup of hemlock (actuallyPhenobarbital D). It turns out to be quite hard to get a price quote for thisservice over the phone. Medical academics I talked to said you would probablyneed at least five professional visits at $60 each, for a total bill of $350 ormore. But the two individuals for whom claims have been made so far cost thestate a total of only $99, which suggests that not a lot of handholding wasgoing on.            Since death itself costs$45, the two-for-$99 figure suggests that the poor of Oregon who claim thisbenefit are getting only $4.50 worth of dignity. On the other hand, how manypeople are there in Oregon who would like to die but have to go on livingbecause they can't scrape together $49.50?            But here's the killer. Before expanding the definition of"health services" to include intentional death by overdose, Oregon was knownfor another kind of health-policy sang-froid. A few years ago the stateexpanded medical benefits to cover more people but fewer ailments. A HealthServices Commission was set up to consider all illnesses and the treatmentsavailable and to prioritize them on a cost-benefit basis. This year's listidentifies 743 different conditions and treatments. There was only enough moneyto treat the top 574 conditions. Venereal warts just made the cut. Uninsuredsufferers from condition No. 575--anal fissures--are out of luck. Ditto Nos.576 through 743.            After hearings last year,the commission decided that, since Oregon voters had approved ofphysician-assisted suicide in not one but two referendums, it was appropriateto include this service under the category of "comfort care" for the terminallyill. "Comfort care" entered the chart at No. 263 with a bullet, just belowacute ischemic heart disease and delirium tremens, nosing ahead of variousmental disorders, Tourette's syndrome, and rectal polyps.            The Oregon legislature is reconsidering all this. Peopleafflicted with illnesses that have not made the funding cut (particularly agroup with the Monty Pythonesque name of Not Dead Yet) are irate that alifesaving operation in the territory around No. 570 can depend on the annualappropriating whims of the legislature, while a free barbiturate consolationprize is safely ensconced at No. 263. Defenders of the commission counter thatit would be unconscionable to deny poor people a right as fundamental asdeath.            It sounds like classicbig-spending liberalism. But is that what is really at work here? Aiding andabetting a suicide--even at $350 per--is cheaper than just about any otherserious medical treatment. Anyone dying in a modern hospital will quickly costmore by staying alive than by exercising the right to die, dignity and all. Thecommission declined to estimate the cost impact of fatal "comfort care." Itcould easily be positive, a money saver. If I were an Oregon Health Plan memberwho suffered from anal fissures (No. 575), my first reaction would bebitterness that by putting assisted suicide at No. 263, the commission hadbumped me and my suffering off the list. But my second reaction would be thatthe more people who take advantage of No. 263, the more likely it is that therewill be money enough for No. 575 after all.            Given the harrumphing by legislators that Oregon votersnever intended to fund suicide when they approved the 1994 referendum, the eraof government-subsidized death will probably soon be over. A federal billsponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would forbid the prescription of drugsfor assisted suicide, presumably taking doctors out of the death-assistancebusiness for all patients.            This is too bad. Oregon led the country in facingthe health-care rationing issue head-on. And now, perhaps unintentionally, ithas taken the next logical step: bribing people to go early and save the systema bit of money. To the agonizing issue of health-care costs for the terminallyill, Oregon has stumbled onto a kind of answer, heartless though it may be.Those who attack it will have to come up with something better.
