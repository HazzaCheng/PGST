                                 No More Kisses            In light of Secretary of State Albright's imminent trip to the middle east,the New York Times ,LosAngeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situationthere. But USA Today stays with Princess Di.            The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday, she will "readthe riot act" to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism. Her goal willbe to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel,telling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting Hamas, and "no morekisses" of its leaders.            The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context. Given that thetroubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat andIsrael, but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and SaudiArabia, the paper states that the U.S. is now facing the prospect that themoderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq andIran is falling apart.            The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government aboutwhether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon,dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week wasambushed, with twelve deaths the result. Perhaps the most striking indicator ofa change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news thatcabinet member Ariel Sharon, who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israelentrenched in Lebanon in the first place, is among those urging areconsideration of the deployment.            Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of itscontrolling stake of Compuserve, but it's the Post with the news thatAOL is set to take it over.            The Wall Street Journal "Outlook" observes, "In the U.S. jobmarket, the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers," andstates that "the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves ofcorporate downsizing," which left behind survivors who took stock of careeroptions and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to landbetter offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries. Thishas led, says the Journal , to annual compensation rising 5-6 percent ayear.            Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm ofmeta- and meta-meta-pieces. The LAT , for instance, examines what ittakes to be a new "cuddly-feely" Britain born of the national grief experience.But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces aswell. Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwillambassador job shortly before her death, and USAT reports that LeFigaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her familyand children.            Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front pageand a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story. "Noteveryone in Calcutta, or India for that matter, is unanimous in praising thenun, whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide butmade virtually no significant changes in the social structure of thiscollapsing city's poor neighborhoods. Salvation--hers and that of the destituteshe rescued from the gutters--was her aim, not economic or social developmentas many others understand it, she said." It's odd, however, that in repeatingthis charge, the Times didn't interview the man most closely associatedwith it, Christopher Hitchens, or refer to the book where he set it out, TheMissionary Position . Hmmm, wanna bet there was a copy of the book onsomebody's desk at the Times though?            What's with the top-of-the-front headline the LAT puts over itspicture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her atthe U.S. Open--"Venus Brought Back to Earth"? Doesn't that sound likecelebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory? How odd--and a goodillustration of how trying to shoe-horn in a "witty" headline can drive youinto an idea that doesn't fit or is undeserved. Given that Ms. Williams'parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a stillpretty-lilly-white sport, don't be surprised if there's a bit of a complaintabout this.
