Testimonials                                                         Slate               'sdecision to ask its readers to pay $19.95 a year (for a product valued by theindependent Microsoft Internet Content Laboratory at "$5,922.95 a year and nota penny less") has produced a flood of comments, ranging from "Drop dead, yougreedbags" to "My husband reads                   Slate                over my shoulder sometimes,so here is $39.90--can I have two umbrellas?"            Remarkably, two members of the president's Cabinet have sent favorable commentswith their credit-card info. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright e-mailedus:                                             Slate                is magnificent. Your "Summary Judgment" column is nothingshort of Talmudic in its commentary, and the ironic humor of "The Week/TheSpin" reminds me of the Jewish folk tales my grandparents used to recite to meback in Czechoslovakia. I never could figure out why my grandparents knew somany Jewish folk tales. Life is full of mysteries. Perhaps                   Slate               will be able to solve some of them.            Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote:            I recall a Cabinet meetingin which                   Slate                was discussed extensively. The consensus among allthese establishment white men in dark suits was that you'll never make it. Thevice president said: "This Internet thing is just a fad. Give me paper and inkany day." But I--a progressive black woman in a demure dashiki and sensiblepumps--insisted: "No, technology is vital to our future. It will liberate theworking man." Of course they wouldn't listen. Why am I always the lonevisionary? Perhaps I can find some soul mates in "The Fray."            Althoughnot officially a present or former Cabinet member, Monica Lewinsky has spenttime in the Cabinet room. She wrote us:            Like, thank God for                  Slate                when I was hustled over to that no-work job at thePentagon. Staring at a computer screen all day, pretending to be busy--it was                  Slate                or Solitaire, I tell you. But Solitaire's so f******hard . Who made those rules, anyway? I'd far rather read those sexyeconomics columns by Paul Krugman. If he doesn't get that Nobel pretty soon, heshould drop by, and I'll give him a consolation prize.            And BillGates wrote:            Well, I wasn't going tosign up. I've got some heavy expenses ahead of me. Twenty bucks can buy a goodtwo or three minutes of a Washington lawyer's time. But I was deeply impressedby one of your "Diary" columns this week. I sobbed-- sobbed! --with shame as Iread about what our government is doing to punish innovation and creativity inthis country. And I loved the author's dig at Scott McNealy. We need to hearmore from the CEOs of large Seattle-based software companies--a group that hasremained silent for too long. By the way, send me that umbrella ASAP. I surecould have used it in those hearings this week. When Orrin Hatch startedflapping his lips, the saliva really flew!
