                                 Y2K Bombshell                           USAToday 's lead is that the Pentagon office responsible for the safety andsecurity of the U.S. nuclear stockpile falsified reports certifying its abilityto deal with Y2K problems. The Washington Post goes with the finding of American expertsthat Russia's economic crisis has left its stocks of uranium and plutoniumincreasingly vulnerable to theft and diversion. The New York Timesleads with word that because most states are behind schedule in their attemptsto eliminate Y2K problems from their computer systems, it's likely that somepeople receiving welfare and other anti-poverty benefits will have theirpayments and/or services interrupted. The Los AngelesTimes leads with the goings-on at the China/Japan summit in Tokyo(which is also fronted by the WP , and carried inside at the NYT ),where leaders of the two countries agreed to deeper economic, environmental,and social ties, but haggled over the form and wording of Japan's officialapology for the brutal acts it committed against China during World War II.                           USAT says the DOD Inspector General concluded that despite its claimsto the contrary, the Pentagon's "Special Weapons Agency" never performed therequired tests on three of its five essential computer systems. Also, it'srevealed that overall the Pentagon got a "D-minus" grade for its Y2K effortsfrom a House oversight committee. The paper quotes the DOD Y2K czar sayingnevertheless that "there's very little real mischief going on here."            The Post lead quotes an American nuclear security expert saying thatthe Russian economy is the world's greatest proliferationthreat--since the ruble was devalued last summer, the government hasslashed the salaries of nuclear plant workers and guards, which means not onlyfewer people protecting the nukes but also more people prone to the temptationsof selling them. Several other authorities, including a Clinton administrationpolicy maker, agreed. But the nukemeisters on the other side display to thePost the same lack of alarm USAT finds at the Pentagon: "I am notparticularly worried," says Russia's atomic energy minister.            The NYT lead reports that according to the GeneralAccounting Office, only one-third of the 421 computer systems used nationwidefor the major health, welfare and nutrition benefit programs are ready for theyear 2000. The piece goes on to quote a White House official with Y2Kresponsibilities complaining that the problem is wrongly viewed as merely aninformation technology issue, and a California official who warns, "If socialservices are disrupted, you'll have more than computer problems. You could havecivil disturbances..."            The LAT lead says that the Japanese delegation finally issued anunsigned document that refers to some of Japan's prior expressions of remorseabout China, but stops short of actually apologizing. But the document doescontain one breakthrough: the first official Japanese reference to the"invasion" of China. The paper explains why Japan is hesitant to go furtherthan this: it fears Chinese demands for compensatory damages.            Yesterday's LAT front reported that Exxon and Mobil were in seriousmerger talks (a story that today runs on the front at the NYT andUSAT ), and today, the LAT 's front says most energy expertsconclude that such a merger would be good for oil and gas production worldwide,thus benefiting consumers. The resulting company would have an increasedcapability to develop new oil deposits. A Wall Street Journal front-page feature er, refines thispoint, saying that Mobil brings with it a far more aggressive approach toexploration.            The WP reports that after a long fallow period, the CIA is recruitingagain. The Agency has narrowed its focus to 66 colleges and universities withwhich it either has or intends to develop, close ties. The list includes, saysthe Post , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, Cornell,Maryland, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Howard, Grambling, Brigham Young, TexasA&M, Texas, Michigan, Ohio State, Purdue, Stanford and Berkeley. (Whathappened to those traditional spook stomping grounds, Yale and Princeton?)            That USAT story about Y2K and nuclear weapons control includes thedefinitive Washingtonthink quotation. Despite the revelations, the co-chairmanof the Senate Y2K committee definitely sees a glass half full: "There aren't asmany people lying to us as there used to be."
