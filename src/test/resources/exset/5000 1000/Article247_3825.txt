                                 The Cartoon Mayor                        Dear Steve:            I couldn't agree with you more about Mayor Giuliani andhis hollow showboating regarding the Brooklyn Museum controversy. While much ofwhat passes for 20 th -century modern art isabsolutely horseshit--painting an entire canvas red is mere laziness, andclaiming that it has meaning doesn't make it so--Giuliani seems determined tobase his whole political career on crushing the messy process that is popularculture and scapegoating people too weak to defend themselves.            As New Yorkers will recall, he launched his career bygoing after homeless guys who spritz your windshield at intersections anddemand a buck to finish the job. OK, so they were annoying, but there are crackhouses that have enjoyed continuous operation during the years that the mayorhas been after the squeegee men. Then he put all the accouterments of streetlife out of business--newsstands, hotdog stands, street vendors--all of whichgave New York a sidewalk-level buzz that separated it from your averagesuburban mall. Last year he attacked taxi drivers with fines forspeeding--frankly, any cabby who can speed in thesechoked streets gets an extra tip from yours truly--and an array of nuisanceregulations designed to make their lives impossible. I drove a cab for yearsand thought it was too hard for $150 a shift; these days you're lucky if youmake $60 for 12 hours of backbreaking through the streets of Manhattan. Whatkind of bully picks on guys who earn five bucks an hour?            More frightening, he's turned Times Square and itsmenagerie of wonderful filth and decadence into Disney World North. The pornshops are all but gone, nightclubs find it nearly impossible to function aftergetting busted all the time, and now he's stopping the rent check to thebiggest cultural institution in Brooklyn. What always made New York great wasits anarchic brew of mayhem and energy; Giuliani is determined to replace bothwith sterility and bourgeois consumerism.            OK, back to comic strips. After yesterday's missive, anumber of people e-mailed me to remind me of Scott Adams' Dilbert --and of course, it's a great strip. It speaks to thecubical culture in which many Americans, including me until a few years ago,spend two-thirds of their waking hours, and does so with consistently funny gaglines. Still, there's quite a bit of repetition there, too, which I think isinevitable. How can anyone draw 365 cartoons a year for 10 years or more andhave each idea be original? I think that's why recent giants like Watterson( Calvin and Hobbes ) and Larson ( The Far Side ) quit after roughly a decade each--you get prettytapped out at 3,000-plus ideas, and they had the class to recognize that.Moreover, the daily papers are constantly shrinking the space available forcomic strips, which means that it's impossible to stretch out artistically.            Ah, I'd forgotten all about editorial cartoonist RananLurie, for whom I once toiled as a graphics assistant (wage: $5 an hour, nobenefits, in 1987) for two months, until you retrieved my repressed memories.Fortunately, I don't read papers where he appears, but his work is trite,appallingly apolitical, and graphically bereft of any character whatsoever.Even worse, the guy never paid me for thinking up ideas, crosshatching,etc.--yo, Ranan, with interest that comes to half the value of your Trump Towerapartment now. I need the cash for drawing lessons, man.            But the greatest conflict in cartooning is about whichis more important: Ideas or drawing. It helps when a creator enjoys both a museand a good hand (as you do, Steve), but the vast majority of cartoonists arelucky to have one or the other. Editors, it seems, lean more to the graphicsside, but I think people like Larson and James Thurber prove that you can drawgreat cartoons with lousy art. I have yet to find a great cartoonist with bador nonexistent ideas. In my case, I know that the art has always been my weakpoint, which is why I developed a highly stylized drawing style (it also helpsto set it apart from the donkey-and-elephant crowd of editorial cartoonists)and why I still take drawing lessons and study everything from old woodcuts toCuban comics. I can't understand gifted artists who intentionally draw lesswell than they're able to; it's a form of self-mutilation. As for the ideas,either you have them or you don't, and there isn't much you can do about iteither way.            Speaking of Peter Max, I hear he's made sort of acomeback on the '70s nostalgia bandwagon--he even had some show a few yearsback in Des Moines, of all places.            Very truly yours,Ted
