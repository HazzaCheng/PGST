                                 One Word, Son: China.com                        You might have thought the biggest winner on Wall Street in the wake of theUnited States and China's agreement on terms for China to enter the World TradeOrganization would have been the company that's been loudest in its support forChinese entry, namely Boeing. But in what may be yet another sign of the adventof an economy based on bits and not atoms--or at least of the mainstreamacceptance of the idea of that economy--the biggest winner today, byfar, was (what a shock!) an Internet company. Chinese-language content providerChina.com's shares rose 75 percent today on news of the accord, raising thecompany's market cap to $2 billion.            China.com went public as a Nasdaq stock--meaning that its actual sharestrade on the Nasdaq, as opposed to what are called American depositaryreceipts--in July, and its shares have now risen more than fourfold. The leaptoday was prompted by one of China's key concessions to the United States, toallow foreign equity investment--up to 50 percent--in both Chinese-ownedtelecommunications companies and Internet companies. This was a prettysignificant about-face, considering that just two months ago, the Chinesegovernment took a public stand against foreign involvement in the ChineseInternet industry, and that many thought that the government would draw a linearound the Net, even if it conceded on telecom. Today's concessions open thedoor to myriad partnerships--how far off can AOL China be?--and the idea seemsto be that China.com has a key foothold in the market.            When you consider that China.com has only 750,000 registered users in acountry of more than a billion people, calling its foothold "key" seems ratherdubious. But the truth is that it's next to impossible to think about businessin China in free-market terms. In a real market, brands are vulnerable, andfirst-mover advantages--like the ones that Compuserve and Prodigy had inInternet access in the United States, for example--can be lost as a result ofcompetition. But in a market in which political connections remain essentialand state intervention can come at any time, a first-mover advantage, insofaras it seems to reflect state sanction, if not support, appears to be rathermore significant.            The paradox inherent in all of this, of course, is that the Internet reallyis an incredibly destabilizing technology, both economically and politically,and yet the Chinese government is doing its best to hold it fixed, even thoughholding it fixed (if that's possible) is the best way to destroy its value. Theviral spread of information on the Internet, the incredibly rapid andinexpensive growth of user communities and businesses, the facilitation ofglobal market relationships: These are the hallmarks of the Net--not merely inthe minds of the digerati but also in the minds of investors. They're the onlythings that make a company like Yahoo worth $50 billion or a company likeChina.com worth $2 billion. Yet these are the things--even after today'saccord--for which the Chinese government has very little affection.            The romantic idea is that the combination of real free trade, the Internet,and modern telecommunications will eventually bring down the hideboundpolitical and economic structures that still rule China. Now, the romantic ideamay be right, and greater access to the Net and greater free trade arecertainly good things. But the truth, banal as it may seem, is that we stilldon't really know very much about how the potentially democratizing Internetreally functions in a thoroughly undemocratic society, just as we don't reallyknow very much about how the market-revolutionizing Internet functions in anon-capitalist economy. Obviously, if the romantic idea is right, the upside isso immense that today's $750 million rise in China.com's market cap will be amere drop in the bucket. But in a way the company's name is the perfectconjoining of two words--China and .com--whose real value lies not in what isbut only (always?) in what may be.
