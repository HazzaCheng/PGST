                                 No Bull, Nobel            The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times all lead with Wall Street's badweek. The Dow finished down 2.85% yesterday, and was down 5.9% for the week,its worst showing since 1991. All three papers also front the Nobel Peace Prizenews: Doctors Without Borders won the cherished award.            Most analysts cite two reasons for the market's downturn: an unexpectedlylarge increase in the product price index (generally a harbinger of inflation),and comments by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warning banks to keep plenty ofreserves. It is widely agreed that the Fed will raise interest rates when theymeet in February. The NYT points to a third cause for the dive,superstition: many investors are selling because they know that the market hassuffered horrible crashes in Octobers past. The LAT runs a related frontpage article explaining the product price index, which measures inflation"before it reaches the consumer." The index rose by 1.1% in September, thelargest one-month jump in a decade. The WP 's coverage is the mostbearish, emphasizing that much of the Dow and NASDAQ's impressive performanceshave been the result of a handful of bluechip stocks. This disparity, accordingto one analyst, creates a "stealth bear" market, where, despite a rosy overallappearance, most stocks are quietly tanking. The NYT dutifully remindsreaders that it's misleading to judge a dip's severity by points rather than bypercentages. Then, without missing a beat, it breathlessly reports that thisweek's 630-point drop was the biggest ever!                        A NYT editorial applauds the Nobel Committee's choice of DoctorsWithout Borders. The organization sends medical personnel to troubled areasthroughout the world. Rejecting the political neutrality of the Red Cross, thegroup is often outspoken about the injustices its members see; the organizationwas expelled from Ethiopia in 1985, and withdrew from Rwanda in 1994 becauseaid was being misused. The WP sees the group as emblematic of a newtrend, where media-savvy non-governmental organizations use press coverage tobroadcast their views and help shape the international diplomatic agenda. DWB,it notes, was the first organization to call the massacres in Rwanda"genocide." This year's Nobel also-rans included President Clinton, thePresident of Israel, and a pair of Chinese dissidents.            The NYT investigates the ascendancy of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,which it attributes to his "unabashed devotion to political money." One of theGOP's premier fundraisers, DeLay has raised an estimated $11 million dollarsfor House Republicans, and gives away as much as 90% of his own campaign funds.He's also been involved in a $25 million fund drive for a group that's "amirror image of the A.F.L.-C.I.O." This has proved controversial because thegroup, which rallies conservative voters to fight labor unions, is non-profit,and thus prohibited from "coordinating" with candidates.            Madeleine Albright's upcoming African tour prompts a WP primer onstrife in Sierra Leone, where Albright will stop Monday. The government in thisdiamond-rich country has battled insurgents since 1991, with miningconglomerates, mercenaries, and other outside interests supplying arms, money,and expertise to both sides. The ensuing clashes were particularly brutal,according to the WP, because the "sponsors" had little motive to limitthe destruction. The warring factions signed a peace treaty this summer.            For the first time in nearly a decade, the WP reports, the MarineCorps is charging a commanding officer with negligence in a training death. Aninvestigation discovered that the officer marched his troops faster than wasrecommended and ignored other safety procedures during a training exercise thissummer. A reservist, who had begun vomiting early in the eight-mile hike,wandered off after the hike's end, and expired of a "heat illness." Ifconvicted, the officer could receive a dishonorable discharge and almost fouryears in prison.            The WP Style section mourns the passing of a cultural icon. Loved bymillions, this hero gave his life trying to protect the ones he loved, after alifetime devoted to fighting tyranny in all its guises. In a novel releasedthis week, Chewbacca, the lovable Star Wars Wookiee, perishes when amoon collides with a planet he was trying to save. The plot twist was approvedby George Lucas, who created the Star Wars saga. Fans of the series haveresponded with characteristic level-headedness, clogging the Internet witheulogizes and declaring a fatwah on the book's author.
