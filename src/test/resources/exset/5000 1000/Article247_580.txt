                                 Revenue Game in Town            The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and New YorkTimes lead with the Senate's vote to overhaul the IRS. USA Today runs thatas its off-lead and goes instead with the FAA's order of urgent inspections andrepairs to 152 older-model Boeing 737s, a story that, of the other majors, onlythe Wall Street Journal puts on the front page. (The NYTnational edition runs it on p. 14, freeing up front-page space to wonderinstead about what killed the artificial turf at Giants stadium.) The FAA movewas prompted by Continental Airlines' discovery in one plane of fuel leakinginto a wire-conduit going through a fuel tank, a situation, USATexplains, not unlike that suspected of precipitating the TWA Flight 800explosion.            Apparently, not a single Senator believes the IRS ever deals with anyonewho's not an abused ex-wife or Howard Baker. The Senate voted 97-0 to put the IRS under a board ofdirectors and to create new limits on the agency's ability to impose penaltieson taxpayers. Like all feel-good legislation, this one will cost money--somesenators estimated that the extra obstacles to collection would cost about $18billion over the next decade, say the papers. But the Senate discussion utterlyfailed to put such figures in the larger context, which is that alreadythe "too-powerful" "abusive" IRS is missing out on at least $100 billion a yearin legally owed taxes and is already auditing less than one percent ofall returns. What's worse, the dailies don't mention this either.            The NYT reports that in Half Moon Bay, California a14-year-old eighth-grade boy has been the first student suspended from schoolunder a new state law that allows removal of students who threaten violence.What makes the case unusual is that what precipitated this were the two papershe turned in for an English class writing assignment: "The Riot," in whichstudents set fire to the school library, blow up the science labs, and beat theprincipal, and "Goin' Postal," in which a boy shoots the school principal. Theboy and his parents are suing his school's principal and the schooldistrict.            The WSJ "Washington Wire" reports that the Army general who heads upthe 1st Cavalry Division had this assessment for acquisition officers of thehigh-tech gear they're providing him: "You are fielding pieces of crap."            A front-page LAT story and one inside at the NYT cover asociological finding coming out today in the journal Science . It's wellknown that people will under-report their questionable behavior when askedabout it by an interviewer, but it has long been assumed that this problem wasaddressed by conducting surveys via paper and pencil questionnaires. However,by comparing paper-and-pencil surveys to those self-administered on a computer,the new study shows that's not true. Which means that many acceptedpaper-and-pencil surveys have rendered a distorted sense of how people behave.The Science study, for instance, purports to show that among 1,60015-19-year-old males, those computer-queried were almost 4 times more likelythan the paper-and-pencil group to report homosex, 5.5 times more likely toadmit they were often or always drunk or high when having sex with women, and14 times more likely to cop to sex with an intravenous drug user.            In the modern age, and especially in the modern newspaper, the pursuit ofmoney takes on the full aura that was, in a bygone time, reserved for thepursuit of something else. Witness today's WSJ front-page account of the Daimler/Chryslermerger. You have to wade pretty far down to get to "revenues," "earningsper share," or "non-recurring income tax benefits." First you get the secrethotel meetings, the furtive use of code names, the artful deflection of anoutsider's nosy question about the relationship. There's even, according to theJournal , an important shower scene. And of course, there is, once theliaison is on the verge of consummation, the age-old question of whose name totake. "It was a very emotional issue at the end, emotional on both sides,"Daimler's CEO is quoted saying. "We both felt strongly." But then they merged.And it was good.
