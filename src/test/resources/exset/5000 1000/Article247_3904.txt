                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        Welcome to hard times. Oh, wait, that was a couple of weeks ago. This week,we're looking for diamonds as big as the Ritz, because the Employment CostIndex came in below expectations, which means that there's no wage pressure inthe economy, making it a good time for capital. Of course, the infiniteregression loop was in full effect today, although no one was following ittoo far out. See, if the ECI was right, then that means that inflation ispretty well under control, which helped lower interest rates and spur a lot ofbuying in the stock market. But that makes most sense if the low ECI is enoughto keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in November. If it'snot, even if inflation is low, the stock market could be burned. So were wejudging the ECI's impact on inflation, or on the Fed's feelings aboutinflation?            I have no idea. All I know is that when I woke up this morning, switched onCNBC, and saw the stock market was up big, I knew without being told that theECI was lower than expected. (That's not a sentence that four years ago I couldeven have thought of, let alone imagined writing.) And so everything's goodagain. Until the next big number comes out. On, then, to this week's CocktailChat.            1. "The major U.S. oil companies reported earnings this week , andalthough, the Wall Street Journal reported, their bottom lines werehelped by higher oil prices, they were hurt by gasoline prices, which didn'trise as fast. I know there is a logic in there somewhere, but if you're sellingoil and gasoline, then aren't you buying from yourself? And if you're buyingfrom yourself, how can higher oil prices help you ?"            2. "Shares in Amazon.com were pummeled Thursday after the companysaid it was going to be spending very heavily on marketing in the next quarterand that its losses could continue to grow. A number of brokerage housesdowngraded the company to 'near-term accumulate' or 'hold', although mostretained their 'long-term buy' ratings. That's always a good one. If you'renot supposed to buy it in the short term, how can you own it for the longterm? It's like Zeno's Paradox for investing."            3. "Offering a more investor-congenial outlook for the future wasPriceline.com, which said it did better than $150 million in revenue in thelatest quarter. Of course, Priceline has the curious habit of reporting asrevenue the total value of the tickets and hotel rooms that it 'sells' on itssite , even though the vast majority of that revenue goes to the airlinesand companies supplying the seats and rooms. So Priceline's actual revenue forthe quarter was, oh, $18 million. It's a powerhouse, I tell you."            4. "The Brazilian government announced that MCI WorldCom would beresponsible for $550 million in back taxes owed by a former state-ownedtelephone company that MCI WorldCom bought last year . Brazil admitted thatMCI WorldCom had been assured, in writing, that it would not be responsible forthe back taxes but said tax authorities had re-evaluated the situation. I guessthe original evaluation went something like this: 'If we lie, they buy thecompany. If we tell the truth, we're stuck with it. I say we lie.' "            5. "Excite@Home spent almost $1 billion to acquire Bluemountain.com, anInternet greeting-card company started by former hippies--does 'hippies' alwayshave to have 'former' attached to it? Blue Mountain has next to no revenue(again, it was started by former hippies ), but lots of visitors. At thisrate, pretty soon you're not even going to be able to say to someone 'youlook like a billion bucks' without insulting him ."            6. "After news broke that Coca-Cola is contemplating selling its drinksin a temperature-sensitive vending machine , which will be able to raiseprices as it gets hotter outside, a Pepsi spokesman said that Coke's planswould 'exploit consumers who live in warm climates.' Yeah, what's up with thatwhole supply-and-demand thing, anyway? Let's get a Five Year Plan on sodapricing, please."            7. "The Employment Cost Index for the most recent quarter came in at just0.8 percent, below expectations, easing investor concerns about possibleinflation. This is the happy situation in which we find ourselves: the lesseveryone makes, the better . Well, the better for stockholders, atleast."
