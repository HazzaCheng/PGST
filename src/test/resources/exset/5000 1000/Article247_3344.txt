                                 Hilary'd Out                        Dear Jodi,            As a proud resident of a Manhattan neighborhood that I pray will always becalled the Upper West Side and as a Times reader who has never deignedto look at "Circuits," I'm afraid that I don't have much to add to your cleverinsights from the F train.            The story in today's papers that caused me to mentally brake to a halt was afront-page piece in the Washington Post by Alan Sipress about how theLos Alamos National Laboratory is now busily researching traffic patterns.Since we have all marveled (maybe grumbled might be a better word) at the waybottlenecks appear and disappear with no apparent cause, I sped through thestory in hopes of discovering a telling insight. Alas, all that the scientistsat Los Alamos and in Germany seem to have come up with is a series of newmetaphors to describe traffic jams. Are they like "water molecules freezinginto ice"? Or is traffic movement akin to "the remarkable darting motion of aschool of fish"? The article, though, did have one memorable bit of deadpanhumor. A scientist, Chris Barrett, is described as the man "who convinced LosAlamos that traffic was a matter of grave national security." Unmentioned inthe Post was that Dwight Eisenhower used the same flimsynational-security excuse to build the interstate highway system.            I'm indebted to Republican political maven Rich Galen and his e-mailnewsletter "Mullings" for putting the Hillary interview in its proper context:It's the media's "August story," an overhyped journalistic frenzy designed tocover the fact that when the shrinks go on vacation, there is virtually no realnews. (Galen, who is a friend, makes his insights available to the world atwww.mullings.com.) A typical August story, which I remember from my early daysat Newsweek ," was the 1983 democracy-in-peril scandal called"Debategate." There were breathless charges, never fully proved as I recall,that someone from the 1980 Reagan campaign had swiped Jimmy Carter's debatenotebook.            I realize that yesterday in my haste to wrap up our correspondence in atimely fashion, I never got a chance to explain why Hillary's Senate race makesme so uncomfortable. Let me count the ways:            1). After an impeachment-tinged year in which the Clinton marriage drownedout all other news (admittedly with a generous assist from Kenneth Starr andPaula Jones), Hillary's decision to run for the Senate forces the country totrek yet again through that tiresome swamp. Maybe the first lady wantsvindication, but as a New Yorker I simply crave relief from this entiretopic.            2). Yes, running for public office while serving as first lady does troubleme in ways that go beyond legalistic questions of whether White House funds areused for her travel and campaign expenses. The law, for example, does notrequire reimbursement for the extensive costs of Secret Service protection whenshe campaigns. Nor is there a way to wall her White House staff off from allpolitical concerns. Al Gore, of course, has the same problem. But, at least,the vice president was elected to his current post.            3). Despite being the crucible of the feminist movement, New York ranks, Ibelieve, 49th in the nation in terms of women being elected to public office.No woman in New York history has ever been elected to a statewide post moreaugust than lieutenant governor. So why don't I hail Hillary's candidacy as animportant feminist breakthrough? Because like Liddy Dole--and in sharp contrastto, say, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer--Hillary owes her celebrity solelyto her husband's political career. New York will never develop its own cadre ofwomen political leaders if people like Congresswoman Nita Lowey are shut out ofthe glamour races.            4). As a baseball fan, I was appalled by the cynicism with which Hillarysuddenly declared her secret yen for the Yankees. Back in 1993, I had a lengthydiscussion with the first lady about baseball. In all her rhapsodies about theChicago Cubs, Hillary never mentioned any American League allegiance to theYankees.            5). I do have some lingering problems with the carpetbagger issue. As ateen-ager, I was in my jejune fashion totally opposed to Bobby Kennedy's 1964Senate candidacy. And I certainly didn't cotton to Connecticut-transplant JimBuckley's 1970 Senate victory on the Conservative ballot line.            That said, I am now officially Hillary'd out.            Over to you, Jodi,
