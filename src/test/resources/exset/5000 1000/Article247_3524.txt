                                 Waco Twofer: Pyrotechnic Tear Gas and Delta Force                        After years of denial, the FBI has admitted to using pyrotechnic (or"incendiary") tear gas in the 1993 Federal assault on the Branch Davidiancompound in Waco, Texas. What is pyrotechnic tear gas and why is itcontroversial?            Tear gas is a basic tool of law enforcement. It causes extreme, disabling,but usually temporary discomfort, and therefore is considered a humanealternative to using guns. There are three common ways to disperse tear gas.Aerosol hoses work like an insecticide spray. They cause the leastamount of physical damage, but can only be used up close. Powdergrenades can be thrown from a distance and send up a mist of powder.Pyrotechnic devices also launch tear gas from afar, in combination witha heat source. The result is an explosion, releasing a cloud of tear gasparticles mixed with smoke. Pyrotechnic tear gas has tactical advantages.First, the smoke cloud obscures the movement of agents as they approach abuilding or crowd. Second, because the metal casing becomes quite hot, it isdifficult for the device to be thrown back at police (a common problem withpowder grenades). The disadvantage is that it can start a fire. The FBIinsists, however, that the timing and location make it impossible to blamepyrotechnic tear gas for the fire that killed 76 people at Waco.            A former CIA officer told the Dallas Morning News that members of theArmy's Delta Force were present at the Waco standoff. Military documentsconfirmed that three commandos observed the siege on the Branch Davidiancompound. The Pentagon stated that it could not discuss any aspect of the DeltaForce--including whether it exists. What is the Delta Force?            The Delta Force is a counterterrorism group established in 1977 by theCarter administration following some particularly bloody attacks on Americansabroad. The thinking was that a small, secret, specially trained cadre ofsoldiers would be able to respond more effectively to terrorist threats,particularly those involving hostages. However, Delta did not stay secret forlong. In their best-known operation, Delta troops assisted in the failedattempt to free American hostages from Iran in 1980. The Delta Force, one ofthe Army's Special Operations units, is based in a remote part of Ft. Bragg,N.C., and is estimated to be as large as 2,500 troops. Delta commandos areknown to have participated in U.S. military action in Grenada, Panama, Iraq,and Somalia.            Use of the Delta Force at Waco is controversial because of the 1878 PosseComitatus Act, which makes it illegal to use federal troops to enforce lawswithin U.S. territory, except when a presidential waiver is granted. For years,this resulted in a strict division between the military and civilian lawenforcement. But the restrictions were amended in the 1980s to allow militaryinvolvement in the drug war. The Army may train law enforcement officials andlend them equipment for use in drug raids. But military troops are stillforbidden to be directly involved in searches, seizures, and arrests--eventhose related to drug crimes.            Because rumors of a Branch Davidian drug lab were floated at Waco (theylater turned out to be false), use of Delta Force troops as advisers in theraid may be legally justifiable. In fact, it is already public record thatother parts of the military assisted in planning the raid and providingequipment. But the level of Delta Force participation remains unknown. If Deltacommandos are found to have played an active role in the raid, theirparticipation may have crossed the line.            Next question?
