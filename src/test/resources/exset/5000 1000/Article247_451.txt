                                 The Check is in the Tail                           USAToday leads with the chief U.N. weapons inspector's suspicions thatIraq has been tampering with his surveillance cameras in his team's absence.The LosAngeles Times leads with the House's resounding passage of an IRSreform bill. The Washington Post leads with the meaning of Tuesday'selections. The New York Timesmetro edition leads with the meaning of Rudy Giuliani's election, while thepaper's national lead is the soon-to-be-announced decision by major mail-ordercompanies to start collecting sales tax from their out-of-state customers.            The upshot of the camera tampering, according to USAT , is that theteam leader can't verify that Iraq is not currently producing weapons of massdestruction. The WP has this story on its front page too.            The LAT IRS lead calls the reform bill's passage by a 426-4 margin a"spectacular display of bipartisanship" created by last month's Senate hearingson IRS mismanagement and taxpayer abuse. The paper points out that the bill,which includes such taxpayer protections as shifting the burden of proof to thegovernment in tax disputes and the creation of a civilian oversight board, willlikely be even further strengthened by the Senate. IRS reform is on theNYT front and in the "world-wide news" box on the Wall Street Journal front, but inside at the WP .            A WSJ front-page piece makes the point that while political debateabout the IRS portrays it as abusing taxpayers, in the world of corporatefinance, it's the IRS that's the underdog, waging a constant war against astream of ingenious and complicated new tax dodges.            The Post concludes that yesterday's Republican victories were mostlydue to lavish financing, widespread social conservatism among voters, and anunwillingness, bred of the healthy economy, to dump incumbents. In light of allthis, says the paper, Democrats are viewing the goals of recapturing the Houseand gaining parity in governorships as more difficult than ever. And accordingto the WP , the lesson for the Republicans is keep talking abouttaxes.            The WP carries an AP story inside stating that the man who used theInternet last spring to accuse the Navy of shooting down TWA Flight 800 is nowsaying that action was "reckless and a mistake." Former JFK press secretaryPierre Salinger, who championed the accusation, has quietly backed off too. Hesays he still believes the government was behind the disaster, but he has toldthe FBI that he is no longer actively investigating.            The NYT runs a story inside reporting that a U.S. intelligenceofficial, "apparently a CIA officer," has left Austria after being caughtwiretapping the phone of a North Korean diplomat. The piece goes on to pointout that in the past three years, CIA officers have been caught spying in, andkicked out of, at least four other countries: Germany, France, Italy andIndia.            The WP , USAT , the NYT , and the LAT all runfront-page stories about how an NIH panel has for the first time concluded thatacupuncture is an effective treatment for some kinds of pain and nausea andshows promise as a treatment for a variety of other conditions. Health expertssay the decision will almost certainly lead to more patients opting for thetechnique and more private and government insurance paying for them to doso.            The WP runs a story inside based on AP reports saying that employeesof a Little Rock junkyard have made an interesting discovery in the trunk of anabandoned car: a 1982 Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan check for more than$20,000 made out to Bill Clinton. The paper points out that last year Clintontestified under oath in James McDougal's bank fraud trial that he had "neverborrowed money from Madison Guaranty." The Post reports that Ken Starrhas been investigating the check.            Go figure: That mail-order sales tax agreement will apply to products soldover cable TV and the Internet, but not to those sold via online informationproviders like America Online.
