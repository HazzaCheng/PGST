                                 More on the Clintons and Psychotherapy            Writing previously about Bob Woodward's wildly hyped book, Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate ,Chatterbox criticized a passage that ended a Washington Post excerpt and seemed designed to leave readers with theimpression that the Clintons were in couples therapy. (See "Woodward Positions Himself on the First Couple.") If the president wasseeing a shrink, that struck Chatterbox as big news. (Clearly, he shouldbe seeing a shrink.) But Woodward wrote the passage in an annoying way thatdidn't really establish whether he was or he wasn't seeing a shrink, and seemeddesigned mostly to allow Woodward to take credit for the scoop if some otherdrudge came along and actually nailed it, while also covering Woodward's ass ifit turned out not to be true.            Now Tina Brown's wildly hyped magazine, Talk , has taken upthe issue again in its much-discussed profile of Hillary Clinton. The profileitself is pretty lame, and has caused a big dust-up over whether HillaryClinton did or should have indulged in some head-shrinking speculation of herown about the source of husband Bill's sexual compulsions. The possibility thatthe connection is the result of some misleading quote-juxtaposition by LucindaFranks herself is explored by                   Slate's previous Chatterboxcolumnist, Mickey Kaus, on his excellent new Web site, Kausfiles.com. (Fulldisclosure: The item also includes some very sensible praise of Mrs.Chatterbox, a k a Vanity Fair and sometime                   Slate                writerMarjorie Williams. And you might as well also know that: a) Chatterbox has beenfriends with Kaus for close to 20 years; b) Chatterbox and Kaus co-edited ananthology of neoliberal writings in the early 1980s that never got published;c) Chatterbox and Kaus attended the same high school, though at differenttimes; d) Chatterbox and Kaus apprenticed at the same magazine, the WashingtonMonthly , though at different times; e) Chatterbox first met the futureMrs. Chatterbox at Kaus' Washington apartment in 1986; f) Kaus was an usher atthe Chatterbox nuptials in 1990; g) Chatterbox and Kaus worked atNewsweek at the same time, though in different cities, during the late1980s; h) Chatterbox has probably neglected to cite five or six additionalconflicts of interest, but figures he has to leave something forBrill'sContent to expose.)            Anyway, setting aside Hillary's own alleged dime-store psychologizing aboutwhy her husband is a womanizer, let's look at what Franks writes about whetherthe president is in psychotherapy:                                             Public office has prevented the president from seeking therapy, butfriends told me they expect him to after leaving the Oval Office.                                       This was misreported in the New York Times as "Mrs. Clinton'sstatement in the article that Mr. Clinton would seek therapy when he left thePresidency." As you can see, the statement is Franks' own, based on what thepresident's friends "told me," a point that seemed to be fully grasped by areporter who asked about it at the Aug. 2. White House briefing. Is it true the president is not seeing ashrink? The Times thought so. It quoted White House spokesman JoeLockhart as saying, "My understanding is the President continues to deal withthe ministers that he talked about at the outset. I can't tell you about thedetails of that because they are private. But he has sought to work withministers who he is close with and friendly with, and that's the extent ofit."            But Lockhart left a little wiggle room that the Times didn't mention.Here's a follow-up from the briefing:                                             Q: Some of these ministers have degrees in other areas, likepsychological--well, psychology degrees. Is he dealing with ministers who havepsychology degrees and deal on other issues--                              A: I don't have the slightest idea. I know who the ministers are. I don'thave the slightest idea what degrees--               Q: Can you tell us who they are?               A: No, because this is something that's private. Although--although at leastone of them has not made a secret of the fact that he's talked to thePresident. [This last is a dig at Jesse Jackson.]                        In other words, it's possible (though probably unlikely) that Clintonis in psychotherapy under the guise of seeking "ministry" from apsychotherapist who's also an ordained minister.
