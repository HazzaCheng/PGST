                                 Dear Africa, Sorry! Love, Bill                                        GETPUNDIT CENTRAL BY E-MAIL!

President Clinton'sapology-strewn tour of Africa is Issue 1: He's sorry about slavery; he's sorryabout the Rwanda massacre. And the schoolyard murder in Jonesboro, Ark., Issue2, bumps the president's sex scandal to Issue 3.            DeborahMathis, Jack Germond, Nina Totenberg ( Inside Washington ), and Brit Hume( Fox News Sunday ) detect hollowness in Clinton's teary expiation forinternational silence on Rwanda. The White House was aware of the genocide,says Hume, and there is no indication that it would act differently today.Perhaps the apology tour was Clinton's way of manufacturing "moral parity" withthe great Nelson Mandela, muses Hume.            The right-wing pundits are incensed by the "most expansiveand extensive groveling and pandering" ever exhibited by a U.S. president (PatBuchanan, The McLaughlin Group ). Noting that the Sudanese routinely sellchildren into slavery, Buchanan sees no need to offer apologies to "thosepeople over there." Robert Novak (CNN's Capital Gang ) is appalled at the"contrition mission," finding Clinton's slavery apologies logically flawed inlight of the many prominent "African-Americans in government, in business, inathletics, in show business," who would not be Americans without the slavetrade. Capital Gang sters Margaret Carlson and Al Hunt--both appalled byNovak--are joined by E.J. Dionne (NBC's Meet the Press ) in arguing that,in fact, slavery is wrong, ergo it's fine for a president to sayso.            A mudslideof pundits construes the Africa Tour as political homage to black voters in theUnited States, a cornerstone of Clinton's electoral base. But that doesn't openClinton to charges of pandering, notes Mark Shields (PBS's NewsHour With JimLehrer ), because politicians of all stripes--from Ronald Reagan to mayorsof New York--routinely visit the Three I's (Ireland, Israel, and Italy) tomollify supporters. If anything, say the pundits, Clinton is shrewd to solidifypolitical support during these dark days.            Beleaguered McLaughlin liberal EleanorClift--joined by Steve Roberts (CNN's Late Edition ), David Gergen, andJay Carney ( The McLaughlin Group )--stresses the tour's salutaryimportance in improving U.S.-Africa trade connections. Clift predicts that in50 years America will conduct a thriving trade with a prosperous Africa.            Thecommentariat is saddened by Issue 2, the senseless killings of four childrenand their teacher by two angry youths. Germond and Tony Blankley (LateEdition ) warn against drawing too many lessons from an isolated, senselessepisode of evil, and Bill Kristol (ABC's This Week ) cautions all againstcompounding the crime by "committing sociology," i.e., relieving the twochild-shooters of moral responsibility for their evildoing. But most punditsshrug off this advice and blame the incident on 1) lax gun-control laws; 2) ourviolent, permissive popular culture; or 3) the popular choice: both.            Clinton's sex scandal dips to Issue 3. Like Paula Jones'lawyers, most pundits are outraged that the White House produced 16Willey-related letters lickety-split in the wake of her 60 Minutesinterview but released only two in response to an earlier subpoena. Thecommentariat repeats its long-held opinion that Clinton's claim of executiveprivilege is bunk. Kristol opines that "it's worth being a little bit outraged"by Clinton's cynical tactics, but Paul Gigot ( NewsHour ) and Shieldsstress that the public does not share his outrage. Clinton elicits a Bronxcheer from several pundits for admitting no knowledge of whether or not hislawyers have invoked executive privilege (the president must sign all suchclaims).            Mostcommentators are mystified by Issue 4, Yeltsin's unexpected putsch. Cliftsuggests that he wanted to install a successor with all the "charisma of a treestump." Carney thinks Yeltsin was feeling ignored and did this partly as apublicity stunt. Several pundits think Yeltsin is crazy like a fox; othersthink he's just crazy or possibly boozed out of his mind.                           It's OK, Leo Strauss Was a DevotedGambler: Someone should slip Kenneth Starr a tape of this week's ThisWeek , where Kristol admits to being eliminated from the office NCAA pool.Pundit Central is shocked-- shocked! --to learn there is gambling at theWeekly Standard .                           --BruceGottlieb
