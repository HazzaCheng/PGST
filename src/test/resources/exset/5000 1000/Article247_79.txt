                                 Views You Can Use!            The newsweeklies are choosing up sides in Flytrap. Time is Monica'sMagazine. Ms. Lewinsky's increasingly creepy mouthpiece, William Ginsburg,cooperates with Time reporters--witness this week's long, generallysympathetic piece on "Monica's World," which portrays Ginsburg as her"surrogate dad" and describes, presumably on some authority, the ex-interns ownthoughts (e.g., "You didn't do anything wrong!"). But Ginsburg has frostedNewsweek , which is perceived to be in Linda Tripp's camp. A shortcritical Newsweek piece on Ginsburg and his "appetite for the high life"notes that he "declined ... to talk to Newsweek ".... Newsweek ,meanwhile, is Paula's Magazine. Indeed you could plot the array of competingnewsmagazine allegiances:                                                                                          Newsweek                     Linda TrippPaula JonesKathleen WilleyVernon Jordan                                                                                  Time                     Monica LewinskyBill ClintonJulie SteeleVernon Jordan                                       There's nothing necessarily sinister about these match-ups. It's a naturalecological phenomenon. If one mag has locked up the sources in one camp--thejournalists' supply of food, as it were--it's only sensible for a competing magto quickly secure the competing food source. Readers should simply be aware, asthey weigh what they are told, that each magazine has an incentive toplease--or at least not totally piss off--its primary allies....            Which is not to say that Newsweek still won't try to throw Ginsburg afew bones in the hope of gaining his cooperation, or that Time won'tskillfully let him make a fool of himself. In "Monica's World," for example,Ginsburg says of his client: "I was there at the beginning. I kissed thatgirl's inner thighs when she was six days old--I said 'Look at those littlepolkas '." What's that all about? Chatterbox is getting Freudianoverload ... Ginsburg is also heard boasting "I truly am the avuncular Mr.Ginsburg," and he condescendingly predicts that "the American people will let"President Clinton "limp to the end of his term." Mighty avuncular of you, Mr.G!                           WOULD YOU BELIEVE HE LUSTED IN HIS HEART?:                                  Slate'seditors are among those who have been privileged to receive the White Housetrial-balloon explanation of Clinton's "complicated" friendship with MonicaLewinsky. You know, he may have had an ... er, avuncular , implicitlysexual and probably inappropriate relationship that was, alas, never actually,physically consummated ... Call it the "modified limited hangout" strategy...                           CHATTERDUMP: Oliver North, running for president? Yes! declareRepublican rumormongers ... And people say Chatterbox has no right-wingsources! ... Why is Kenneth Starr wasting time waging a big fight with Clintonaide Bruce Lindsey over whether Lindsey's testimony is protected by "executiveprivilege"? Does anybody really think that even if Lindsey is required toanswer every question, he'll actually incriminate Clinton? At best, he'll say"I don't recall"... A joke that produces consistent hilarity at Washingtonparties: Why did Clinton have to get blowjobs from Monica Lewinsky? Because SidBlumenthal hadn't joined his staff yet! ... But seriously, Chatterbox wants todefend "Grassy Knoll" Blumenthal against those who trash him for giving adviceto his friends the Clintons while he was still a writer for The NewYorker . Blumenthal was writing for an opinionated magazine, after all, ifnot for a New Republic -style "magazine of opinion." He gave his opinionsto his readers. He gave his opinions to the Clintons. Where's the conflict? Ifthe Clintons call to get Chatterbox's advice, they'll get it!... The problem,in principle, would come if Blumenthal was giving different opinions to theClintons and to his readers (something he's not accused of) or if Blumenthal'sreaders were somehow misled into thinking they were getting a dispassionateperspective. But any New Yorker subscriber who didn't realize thatBlumenthal was massively ego-invested in the Clintons' success just wasn'tpaying attention ... Chatterbox hopes this stout defense won't stop Blumenthalfrom ordering the Clinton critic-intimidation team to investigate Chatterbox'sprivate life. What fun! What publicity! ... For the record, Chatterbox hasnever done anything avuncular, though it tried once in college ...
