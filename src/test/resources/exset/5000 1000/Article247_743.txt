                                 Not Erection Results            The elections rule. USA Today slugs the story "Democrats Dash GOP Hopes," andits front-page "cover story" says yesterday brought "good news for the man whowasn't on the ballot," Bill Clinton. Similarly, the New York Timesmain headline reads in part, "Democrats Hold Off G.O.P. Advance, WeakeningImpeachment Prospects...." The Los AngelesTimes headline lavishes its big type on the victory of Democrat GrayDavis in the California governor's race, the re-election to the Senate ofBarbara Boxer and the victory of the initiative permitting Indian-run casinos.And the headline over the Washington Post lead credits the Democrats with scoringsignificant upsets-- the Post , like everybody else, stressing the defeatof GOP incumbent senators Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth ofNorth Carolina.            The papers cite the general satisfaction exiting voters expressed--withClinton, with the economy, and with their own lot in life. And everybody says6o percent of voters thought Clinton should not be impeached. The upshot isthat the Republicans will not achieve a filibuster-proof majority in theSenate. Although, as everybody notes, the Republicans do retain control of boththe House and the Senate.            The press consensus is that the only real bright spots for the Republicansare the victories of the brothers Bush in the Texas and Florida gubernatorialraces. The LAT says that George W. Bush's re-election instantly makeshim the Republican presidential front-runner. The NYT 's R.W. Apple saysboth Bushes are to be reckoned serious presidential contenders. And MaureenDowd only seems to be half-joking when she suggests that the brothers formaBush-Bush ticket in 2000.            A front-page Wall Street Journal story details a little-noticed aspectof the emerging e-marketplace: large corporations are moving slowly intoInternet marketing, not really any longer because of misgivings about itspower, but because it threatens to destroy traditional hands-on sales channels,which still constitute about 90 percent of most companies' order flow. Forinstance, the Journal ponies up a Seattle GM dealer who has made tenadditional sales this year with the help of his automaker's Web sites, but whoalso worries that GM might someday just take buyers' orders directly and getrid of him.            With the papers relentlessly rah-rahing over the latest exploits of the hometeam, often, amazingly, on the front page, it's sobering to take in theNYT op-ed on the rampantcriminality of professional football players. According to the piece, it'slook-the-other-way day in the front office. Coach Dick Vermeil of the St. LouisRams is quoted saying this about a linebacker charged last week withinvoluntary manslaughter in a crash in which the other driver died: "I thinkit'll be good for him to get back and get with his teammates and get goingagain." Then there's another Ram who plays on despite having pleaded guilty toaggravated assault in a case where the victim suffered partial paralysis andbrain damage. And the Miami Dolphin wide receiver who, despite one convictionand two arrests for beating his fianc,e, was offered a new contract by the cluband has never been disciplined by the league. The author, Jeff Benedict, claimsthat a study he helped conduct shows that 1 out of 5 NFL players has beencharged with a serious crime.            An AP story inside the WP reports that the Caldor department storechain has apologized for unwittingly publishing 11 million copies of anadvertising circular in which two smiling boys are depicted playing Scrabblearound a game board where the pieces clearly spell out the word "RAPE."            The WP , famous for applying wholesomeness principles to its copy,outdoes itself today. The Reliable Source's item about an election dayget-together of old pols includes this quote from one of them: "If a bomb wentoff in this place, 50 percent of the country's known supply of [equinedroppings] would be destroyed." Can't the Post see that whereas theactual phrase used would go by virtually unnoticed, the paper's baroquetranslation only forces the reader to dwell on the matter?
