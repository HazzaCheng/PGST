                                 Excess Baggage            The blow-by-blow of the Mideast peace talks continues to dominate, leadingat USAToday , the New York Times ,and the Washington Post . This is also the top international newsstory at the Los Angeles Times , which leads instead with word thatbilingual education continues to thrive in California's public schools despitepassage this year of a statewide initiative substantially restricting it.            The big peace talk development yesterday, the papers report, is thatBenjamin Netanyahu warned Yasser Arafat that he would take his delegation homeif his country's West Bank security demands were not met. The most pressingdemands appear to be for the Palestinians to repeal the PLO charter's provisioncalling for the destruction of Israel, and to turn over to the Israelis anumber of suspected terrorists. The NYT , WP , and LATreport that things had unwound so much that the Israel delegation had packedtheir bags and some of their luggage was transferred to the airport.            It's not clear from the coverage why the Israelis didn't make good on theirthreat. The NYT quotes an American official saying it was just theIsraelis' "childish ploy," intended for domestic Israeli consumption. TheLAT notes that both settlers and the right wing of Netanyahu's own partyare warning him not to roll over. The WP cites this factor and addsanother: Netanyahu, who is inclined toward GOP sentiments, knows how much abreakthrough before the congressional elections would mean to Bill Clinton, andhence wants to deny him this success. This American political angle is veryprominent in the WP reporting, which says flatly that Clinton wants adeal far more than the participants he's hosting do. At one point, theLAT makes a bathetic and rather yuppyish reference to Clinton's role,saying that thus far, he has "invested more than 55 hours" in the summit talks.Do you think the papers ever wrote about Ralph Bunche or Dag Hammarskold as ifthey billed by the hour?            The USAT runs a front-pager reporting that as part of thejust-concluded budget agreement, U.S. researchers will receive $23 million tocontinue work on a drug-eating fungus that could destroy opium poppies and cocaplants. A congressman who co-sponsored the funding says that the technologyshould be finished in about a year.            A Wall Street Journal feature makes the point that theBorder Patrol, the unit of the INS that most directly polices the Mexicanborder, is no longer just Anglos. Currently, 38 percent of the patrol's rank-and-file officers are Hispanic.This is a result of the INS' beefing up of its Operation Gatekeeper, whichtargets illegal entries from Mexico into the San Diego area. The expandedhiring recruited heavily from southwestern border states and emphasized fluencyin Spanish. The Hispanic agents often come in for special pleading in Spanishand failing that, special abuse, from those they detain.            The WP front features the surprisingly successful Minnesota gubernatorial candidacy of Jesse "The Body" Ventura, alibertarian former professional wrestler, bodyguard, Navy Seal and talk showhost. Ventura has, reports the paper, stimulated the electorate with anunpackaged campaign the likes of which have not been seen since early Perot.Before dismissing Ventura as any kind of a stereotype, consider his response toa question about his stance on gay rights: "I have two friends that have beentogether 41 years. If one of them becomes sick the other one is not evenallowed to be at the bedside. I don't believe government should be so hostile,so mean-spirited....Love is bigger than government."            Both the NYT and LAT fronts feature stories about so-called"smart guns" that can only be fired when held by thedesignated shooter, because of a distance-sensitive transponding device such asa finger ring. The guns could, the papers write, unify both sides of the gundebate in that they promise to boost gun sales for manufacturers developingthem, while reducing accidental shootings by children and "take-away" shootingsof cops. But, notes the NYT , there are still concerns: a government testhas found that there are reliability problems, many due to limitations ofbattery life, and even if perfected, the technology would make no dent in gunsuicide by rightful gun owners, or in the gun deaths lurking in the form of allthe "dumb" guns already out there.            Today's Papers mourns the way-too-soon passing of a friend and colleague,the Wall Street Journal 's Christopher Georges. Readers are encouraged todiscover the legacy of fine stories he left behind, at the Journal andbefore that, at the Washington Monthly .
