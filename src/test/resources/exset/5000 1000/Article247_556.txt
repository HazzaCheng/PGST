                                 These Guns Not For Hire            The New York Timesleads with President Clinton's decision to impose a ban on the import of 58types of assault-type weapons. This is also the top national story at theLosAngeles Times . The Washington Post 's top national story is a federally fundedstudy indicating that a drug previously used to prevent a recurrence of breastcancer could dramatically prevent its onset as well. USA Todayleads with the Department of Transportation's decision to crack down onairlines that use unfair methods to snuff out low-fare competitors.            The news about the breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, comes, saysthe WP , from the largest clinical experiment ever for testing a drug'spowers of cancer prevention. However, tamoxifen is also known, says the paper,to treble the risk for uterine cancer, and to increase one's chance ofdeveloping blood clots. (The headline over the story at USAT , which runsit as its top-of-the-front-page "talker," emphasizes the "big risk.") It'slikely therefore, that the drug will only be recommended for women at high riskfor breast cancer.            Clinton's gun move, says the NYT and LAT , could keepmore than one million high-powered guns out of the U.S. Assault weapons of thissort have been banned previously, by the Bush administration (1989) and by anearlier Clinton ban (1994), but foreign manufacturers responded by slightlymodifying their weapons. But now, explain the papers, the ATF has ruled thatthese modifications are superficial and hence that the ban sticks. TheNYT says that the timing of the announcement was driven by Clinton'sdesire to dramatize government action in the wake of the Arkansas schoolyardshootings, even though none of the types of weapons used there are affected bythe decision. The NRA assailed the ban, and promised to seek relief in Congressand the courts. The LAT says a White House official cites as one reasonfor the move the paper's series last year about how weapons companies weremodifying their guns to make them legal but not less lethal. The WPcarries the story inside.            The Wall Street Journal runs a "Rule of Law" feature detailingthe recent trend of the solidification of the rights of dogs, even viciousones. Courts in several states, for instance, have invalidated breed-specificbans because they "deny pit bull lovers equal protection and due process."Plus, Congress is considering "boneheaded" legislation that would force citiesto allow pit bulls in public housing.            A piece in USAT 's "Money" section reports that federal officials areconcerned about the proliferation of companies on the Internet posing as banks.In the past two years, the government has issued ten alerts about suchventures, which could appear to be just like the more than 1,600 legit,chartered banks with web sites.            Inside the WP there's an AP story stating that according to theDepartment of Justice's latest figures, alcohol is a factor in nearly 40percent of all violent crimes. Victims of spousal abuse report that fullythree-fourths of their attacks were alcohol-related.            In Sunday's column, Maureen Dowd pointed out that when Ken Starr was pressedrecently to justify the $30 million he's spent so far javerting Bill Clinton,Starr replied that hey, he always flies coach on his investigatory jaunts toLittle Rock. In the adjacent op-ed, Robert C. Reich reported that first- andbusiness class seats now account for more than 22 percent of airlines' domesticpassenger revenue, up from just 9.5 percent in 1987. And according to Sunday'sLAT , a dozen California members of Congress routinely use governmentfunds for upgrades to first class or for first-class tickets. The LATdilutes the effect of this story by not mentioning any of the dirty dozen byname until after the jump inside to page 22. The reader has to wait until thetenth paragraph to learn that former Rep. Ronald Dellums routinely booked firstclass seats for his trips, at a cost to taxpayers of six times the basicgovernment rate.

Does, for instance, renowned high-liver JohnnyApple of the NYT fly first class when he's on a story and, if so, doeshe pay the extra cost or does the Gray Lady go to the hip?
