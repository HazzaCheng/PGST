                                 Long Live Celluloid                        Dear Friends,            No quarrel from me about the excitement of being a film critic in 1999. Thiswas one of those miraculous years like 1974 when new talents, and revitalizedold talents, came bursting forth. The year was a slow starter, despite suchearly exceptions as Altman's Cookie's Fortune and Kore-Eda's AfterLife , but starting with the Telluride and Toronto festivals there was anunveiling of riches that went on week after week after week.            I agree with the praise for Being John Malkovich and ThreeKings --movies that were free . Watching them, we had absolutely noidea what would happen next, and the last half hour of Malkovich was asinventive and unexpected as the first. Having been pounded through the '90swith predictable, upbeat film endings dictated by test audiences ("Does Joanreally have to burn at the stake?"), I was so exhilarated to see films thatgave themselves the liberty to surprise and amaze me.            At year's end, there was another film like that, Paul Thomas Anderson'sMagnolia . I would not dream of revealing what happens at the end ofthat movie, but I wanted to cheer when it did happen, because Andersonwas demonstrating in a way both comic and bizarre that all narrative isarbitrary--that no matter what happens next, it need not, and that no directorneed feel shackled by audience or studio expectations.            I imagine Magnolia will get widely divergent reviews (I know of onenational critic who has put it on his "10 worst" list), but I thought it struckthe right note to close this season of invention. Yes, some will argue thatAnderson's surprise is cheating, or arbitrary, or a trick--but the way for itis prepared by Ricky Jay's witty narration at the beginning of the film, whichall but tells us to expect learned pigs.            I was disappointed that David, having applauded so much innovation, putJulien Donkey-Boy on his worst list. I think Harmony Korine demonstrateshere that he has the soul of a real filmmaker. Yes, the movie is frustratingand aggressive, but after it is over it has revealed a shape and purpose, onesuited to its style (the whole story is seen through the eyes of aschizophrenic).                           Julien serves another symbolic function this year: It was shot on avideo camera, and (if we can judge by the outtakes on the Web site) its stylewas created mostly in post-production on a computer much like the one I am nowusing. Julien and The Blair Witch Project are the foot in thedoor of digital production; these days anyone can make a movie, and ifit is good enough, can find an audience for it. Cassavetes would rejoice (maybenot at those two movies--but think how he would have welcomed the freedom of adigital video camera).            I was told last January at Sundance that 1999 would be the last year inwhich more of the movies had been shot on film than video. We shall see. I amas firmly in support of video production as I am opposed to the alarmingspecter of digital video projection in theaters--a subject that most moviecritics have ignored.            Most people in the industry believe the hype that digital projection isdestined for the near future. The fact is that digital projection is nowherenear being practical or affordable, and even if it were--are video and film thesame thing? Some perceptual scientists believe video creates a hypnotic mindstate, and film creates a reverie state. Why is it that we sense, however,vaguely, a different mental state in a movie than while watching television?How ironic if Hollywood threw out a century of film to adopt a technology thatdid not evoke the mind-state that people buy movie tickets in order toobtain?            Elvis knows this is an obsession of mine; in Sunday's Chicago Sun-Times I published a long article that questionswidespread beliefs about the Texas Instruments digital projection system andextols a much cheaper film projection system called MaxiVision48, which usesexisting, proven technology, and produces a picture its patent holders claim is500 percent better (not a misprint) than existing film or digital projection,take your choice.            As we bow gratefully to this wonderful final year of the first century offilm, let us hope it is not one of the final years of celluloid itself.            Roger Ebert
