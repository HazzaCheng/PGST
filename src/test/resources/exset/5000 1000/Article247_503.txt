                                 Internal Affairs            The Washington Post leads with Independent CounselKenneth Starr's investigation into allegations that President Clinton subornedperjury by a former White House intern. A three-judge panel, reported both thePost and Los Angeles Times , has authorized Starr to explore chargesthat Clinton and his close friend Vernon Jordan persuaded the intern, MonicaLewinsky, to deny that she had had a year-and-a-half-long affair with thepresident after she had detailed the relationship in 10 conversations withLinda Tripp. Tripp, a colleague at the Pentagon where Lewinsky later worked,recorded the conversations surreptitiously and reportedly turned the tapes overto Starr. Both Clinton and Lewinsky denied the affair in sworn depositions inthe Paula Jones case. Clinton lawyer, Robert Bennett called the story"ridiculous" and told the Post he "smelled a rat." Neither Bennett norWhite House officials would comment on whether Clinton had discussed hertestimony with her.            The Clinton/Netanyahu talks lead at the New York Times . USAToday goes with the finding that Theodore Kacszynski is legally competentto stand trial, which is also the top national story at the LAT .            The WP reports that President Clinton, who will meet with YassirArafat on Thursday, is getting into an unusual amount of detail in the latestMideast talks.            The WP reports that before the two leaders broached substantivematters, they made an attempt to clear the air about their own troubledrelationship. Netanyahu complained about being snubbed by Clinton on a priorvisit to the U.S., and Clinton chided him for meeting with Jerry Falwell theother day, noting that Falwell has distributed videos suggesting that Clintonmay have been complicit in a murder. The NYT , in its lead, says thatadministration officials were "furious" about the Falwell rendezvous. The Postreports that Netanyahu presented Clinton with a stack of gross images of Jewsand Israelis from Arab newspapers.            The LAT reports that the two leaders met again last night but alsostates that the long talks have thus far failed to restart the deadlockedMiddle East peace process.            Besides the court-appointed psychiatrist's finding that Kacszynski can standtrial, the papers also pass along indications that she found him to be mentallyill. USAT quotes an AP story saying that in her eyes he's a paranoidschizophrenic, and the NYT says that she concluded he "actually doesresort to violence against those individuals and organizations that he believesare hurting him." Most of the dailies hint at the possibility of renewed pleabargaining now, with USAT stating flatly that this is underway. Promptedby the recent murder of a NYC plainclothes officer during a drug bust, theNYT has an informative take-out on undercover work, which points outthat about twice a month a NYC undercover officer is shot during a buy, andfive or six times a month, one is forced at gunpoint by dealers to use coke orheroin. The story adds that about 70 percent of the city's undercover cops areblack or Hispanic. Both the LAT and NYT report in front-pagestories that Cuba is reaping a financial windfall from the Pope's visit. TheLAT estimates that tourists and media types will pump an extra $25million into the local economy. And the NYT reports that hotel priceshave recently doubled and that the government has come up with such extras as a$1,000 licensing fee for each satellite phone brought in by the networks.Additionally, Cuban state television is charging each visiting TV outfit a$100,000 fee for the live video feed of the Pope's activities.            The WSJ reports that State Farm is suing Ford and one of itssuppliers, alleging that the car company concealed ignition switch defects thatled to car fires and millions in insurance claims. (This story is also on theNYT front.)            The on-off-on again decision of the National Holocaust Museum to inviteArafat for a look-see while he's in D.C. generates an uncommon amount ofopinion at the WP . Sure, invite him, says columnist Jim Hoagland.Absolutely not, counters columnist Charles Krauthammer. The paper's editorialon the matter says it all, though: "Very few people tour [the museum] and comeaway unmoved and unchanged. Perhaps Mr. Arafat would be one of those rareexceptions. But what would be lost by taking that chance?"            The NYT editorial page is likewise on the mark in its discussion ofwhether in light of the Guatemalan student rapes, American college excursionsshould be curtailed, pointing out that such enriching experiences are probablynot as rape-risky as fraternity parties.
