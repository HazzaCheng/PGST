                                  Hsing-Hsing             Hsing-Hsing and I grew up together. I arrived inWashington in late 1970 as a six-month-old infant. He came to the National Zooabout a year later as a six-month-old cub. As a child, I took more field tripsand family outings to visit Hsing-Hsing and cellmate Ling-Ling than I cancount. For the past six years I have lived next door to his zoo, and hardly aweek passes when I don't jog or stroll through its grounds. I watchedHsing-Hsing grow from cub into giant panda and meticulously followed hisefforts to mate with Ling-Ling. I knew this panda. So I speak from theheart when I say: Good riddance to the semi-bear.            Hsing-Hsing, who died Sunday, and Ling-Ling, whodied in 1992, drove otherwise reasonable people barking mad. At the time of hisdeath, Hsing-Hsing was the most famous animal in the world. More than 60million people had visited him during his life sentence at the National Zoo.Pandaphilia turned the Washington Post into the zoo's own propagandarag. According to obituaries, Hsing-Hsing "enchanted" and "enthralled"visitors. He was a wonderful "diplomat" between China and the United States. Hewas "sweet-natured"--the most "cuddly" and adorable of all creatures. "Theworld needs all the teddy bears it can get," mourned one Postmemorial.            George Schaller, aleading panda biologist, describes giant pandas as perfectly symbolic animals.With their lovely fur, clumsy movements, and goofy faces, they seem theembodiment of innocence, childishness, and vulnerability. This is also thepublic image so carefully cultivated for them by endangered-species activists.But behind the pretty face lurks, well, a bore. If we're going toanthropomorphize pandas, let's be realistic about it. The idea that pandas aresweet and genial is ridiculous. Pandas are not ill-natured. They are worse:They are no-natured. Drearier animals you cannot imagine. They are highlyanti-social, detesting interaction with other pandas and people. In all mytreks to the pandas' cell and yard, I never once saw them be playful oraffectionate or active or even violent. Compared to almost any other animal inthe zoo--apes, big cats, seals, prairie dogs, snakes--the pandas were a drag.They led a life of unparalleled tedium. Pandas are Mother Nature's couchpotatoes. They are staggeringly lazy, so slothful they avoid climbing treesbecause it's too tiring. Their entire lives are spent eating bamboo andsleeping. (Not that there is anything wrong with eating and sleeping--I wouldlike to spend my own life that way--just don't call it endearing.)            But Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling were not simply dull. Theywere also unpleasant. Confinement depresses zoo animals, and the pandas were noexception, behaving more like kooks than teddy bears. Ling-Ling, unprovoked,assaulted one of her keepers and gnawed on his ankle. The animals' decadelongattempt to mate was played as comic opera, but it was much darker. At firstHsing-Hsing failed to inseminate Ling-Ling because he tried to mate with herear and her arm. (He may have been inept because he never learned about matingin the wild.) Then the zoo imported a male panda from London Zoo to mate withLing-Ling. He mauled her instead. (So much for panda comity.) EventuallyHsing-Hsing got it right, and between 1983 and 1989, Ling-Ling bore five of hiscubs. All of them died within days. One cub perished after Ling-Ling sat on it.Another seems to have been killed by a urinary tract infection acquired fromLing-Ling. Keepers believe Ling-Ling infected herself by sticking bamboo andcarrots up her urinary tract, surely neurotic behavior.            The National Zoo is pleading with China to replaceits dead pandas. Mao Tse-tung gave Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling to the UnitedStates as a gift, but today's free-market China is savvier. The five pandas inAmerican zoos are here on long-term loans, at a going rate of $1 million perpair per year. China has offered a discount to the National Zoo: $8 million for10 years. The zoo has countered with $2.5 million. I say keep the money, leavethe pandas in the wild, and buy a few more seals instead. After all, theSmithsonian just announced plans to stuff Hsing-Hsing and exhibit him. Theycould just stick some bamboo in his paws, return him to his old cage, and claimthey had received a new panda. No one would notice the difference.
