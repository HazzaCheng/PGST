Responsesto Wednesday's question (No. 140)--"Don't Legislate; Medicate":                                       According to Houstonpsychiatrist Dr. David Krueger, "Part of the reason so many women take thesetypes of drugs is that men tend to have trouble admitting they have a problem."What types of drugs?                        "Sex-changehormones."--Ariel Kaminer                        "Chocolate."-- G.C.                        "Unclear antecedentblockers."--Colleen Werthmann                        "Roofies. 'It turns outmany women have a more satisfying sexual experience if unconscious,' explainedDr. Krueger. 'Yes, I do happen to be single. Why do you ask?' "--BethSherman                        "Crack. 'Of course,'Krueger said, 'I may be oversimplifying.' "--Tim Carvell                        Click for moreresponses.                           Randy'sFull Responsibility Wraparound                        Responses to "News Quiz"naturally vary in both quality and quantity. Fill in the blank, for example,typically sparks the most responses. Today's question generated only about halfthe usual returns, and here's why: It's not very good. And here's whose faultit is: mine. Devising the question calls for the deft and tactful art of thestraight man, for playing George Burns to your Gracie Allen. It's not just amatter of lobbing one over the plate for you to hit out of the park. It'sputting one over the plate that, when you clobber it, erupts in a shower ofconfetti that coalesces into a single scarlet flamingo that flies over to thebox seats and bites George Steinbrenner on the ass. But not today.            The drugmetaphor is opaque and clumsy. And the central premise invites the too-familiargender-wars responses. Plus, there is something uncomfortable about maleadmissions of inadequacy; it's like pleading guilty to a burglary so you won'tget nailed for a murder. Incidentally, the most common response was, as many ofyou suspected, jokes about men's reluctance to ask for directions. However,we've declined to run such observations out of respect for Jerry Seinfeld. Andagain, it's all my fault for leading you into this swamp. I'll try to do bettertomorrow. And I'll never again use a manly baseball metaphor. (Picture mehumbly not spitting.)                           A Gram IsBetter Than an Answer                        Lifestyle drugs.            Asdistinguished from medicines that relieve pain or cure illness, many drugs inthis category have failed to meet financial expectations. Drugs to promote hairgrowth (Propecia) and to stop smoking (Nicotrol) have had disappointing sales.With the exception of Viagra (with projected first year returns of up to $1billion, the most successful drug rollout in history), men have been a hardersell than women, who buy 60 percent of the top three anti-smoking drugs. Mentend to abandon such remedies if they're not immediately effective.                           LeverageYour Germanness Extra                        "German is the ideal tothe American male. It's strong, and it's all about precision and expertise. Wesaid: 'If you leverage your Germanness, that's really potent for thisparticular target audience. It just triggers all the things they want to thinkabout themselves.' "--Jennifer Laing , Saatchi & Saatchi, onadvertising strategy for Beck's beer; she does not say if this would have beena good advertising strategy for the Wehrmacht                        "I can smile, but it'shard to think about whether that stereotype is realistic. As long as you, as aGerman, make a joke at your own expense, it's OK."--Axel Meermann ,global marketing director, Beck's beer; he does not say if it's OK if suchjokes are made by me, as a Jew            "[Hitler's rule was] anaberration, but not an organic aspect of German society."--HenryKissinger ; he does not say if the rule of Augusto Pinochet, which he helpedengineer, was an organic aspect of Chilean society            "To some people, 'Berlin'still sounds too Prussian, too authoritarian, too centralized."--ChancellorGerhard Schrder ; he does not say if "hell" sounds too hot                           Disclaimer: All submissions will become the property of Slate andwill be published at Slate 's discretion.
