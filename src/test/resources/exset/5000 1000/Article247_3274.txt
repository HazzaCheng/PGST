                                 You Can Lead a Kid to Bacon ...                        Dear Steve,            You're right, we began somber and became silly, which is a fairrepresentation of my breakfast table--I'm thinking of the morningtrajectory from stumbling glumly downstairs to fighting over the comics, exceptthat around my table the only audible dialogue is generally, "You done withthose yet?" punctuated by the clank of spoon against cereal bowl. There was aphase a while back when I filled with resolve, for reasons then unclear tomyself but transparent to any female who has ever cracked the pages of aMcCall's or Family Circle , to cook hot meals at breakfast. I hadin mind the sort that appeared in magazines, with the little wisps of steamvisible as the plates were lowered to the table. I made muffins, or scrambledeggs with green chiles and cheddar cheese, or crepes rolled around blackberryjam, or whole-wheat pancakes with peanut-butter chips (I know, this sort offits into the category of manteca en su bolsillo , but they're actuallypretty good). There was a lot of bacon, too. Something elemental about bacon:the smell, I think. Also good sound effects. My kids looked startled at first,large plates of steaming food at 7 a.m.--What is going on around here? Is MomOK? Maybe better not ask. Then there was a Mom's Cafe phase: "Oh, look, it'sbreakfast at the Mom's Cafe."            Then my daughter got up the nerve to say: Um, this is nice but you know Ireally like Crispix. My son, who had rattled both of his deeply secularparents a few years earlier by requesting a bar mitzvah (for which, to ourastonishment, he studied intently for two years, delivering himself of awhomping cantor-led performance and bar mitzvah speech in which he discussed inserious 13-year-old voice his intense feeling about carrying on a tradition hisfather's family had let lapse), told me kindly one day that he had stoppedeating pork so maybe I could cut back on the bacon. My husband, in theinterests of middle-aged guy health, dropped eggs and muffins from his diet. Sothat was that for the wisps of steam at our breakfast table. The Crispix cameback in force; in fact, the last time I was at the supermarket, the checkergazed at my overflowing cart and said: "Lot of cereal eaters in your house, arethere?"            I do have one more somber thought, though, because I really am troubledabout this, even though I can see no way to let off even a tiny rant withoutpersonally contributing to the very problem of which I speak: I do believe thepress, and in particular the broadcast press, took leave of its collectivesenses last weekend when that little plane disappeared--surely not the firsttime such a thing has happened, but I am afraid that the net result, followingday after day of relentless, nonstop, overblown, breathless, self-referential,nearly entirely content-free coverage, has been the transformation of a singlepublicly shared tragedy into something venomous. I think people are justfurious at the coverage. I think fury at the coverage has in some measurereplaced what might have been a brief period of honorable,modestly-proportioned mourning for some famous people who died. I think we'llbe hearing about this for quite a while, and that the demonstrably low publicregard for reporters and commentators will dip still lower in the wake of thispast week. I know, we do this all the time, we did it when Diana died, and wewill surely do it again--but it seems mysterious to me that in the first yearpost-Monica, when so many reporters looked back in embarrassment and agreedthat events and group-think had sucked us into dreadful vacuous coverage fromwhich we felt unable to extricate ourselves, the same blind terror of losingaudience share could have overtaken assignment editors again.            So that is my closing rant. I'm afraid the only journal in our house thatfor interest factor can be rated anywhere near your Journal of InconspicuousConsumption is our full-color glossy monthly called Lowrider , whichwas given to my son--no, not himself a lowrider, his only available vehicle isthe denuded Toyota van--as a Christmas present last year. I have actuallybecome quite fascinated by this magazine and was going to dig out the latestissue to report on exactly which babes in bikini tops and pachuco pantswere jutting their hips out beside which gleaming, curvaceous, cherried-out20-ton American car. But it seems I was overcome by feminist bile one morningand tossed it. Pity. I bet Lowrider is a hit in Austin. And is now thetime to say I can hardly wait for your impending new novel about the Alamo?            It's been swell, Steve, but do something about that lard in your pocket,OK?
