                                 Witless for the Prosecution            Everybody leads with the emerging ground rules for the Senate impeachmenttrial that starts today. The headlines emphasize various aspects of what's inthe works. The Washington Post big print stresses the likelihood of livetestimony, particularly that of Monica Lewinsky. The New York Timesheadline dwells on the probability of a "full trial" leading to a vote on thetwo articles of impeachment. The Los AngelesTimes header says the new Congress is in "turmoil" and claims that thetrial may "eclipse all public business." And the USA Todayheadline says a short trial is unlikely.            According to the papers, what is emerging from yesterday's full shift ofSenate pre-trial conferences is a trial of some weeks' length that will leadnot to a censure vote, but to an up or down vote on the specific charges theHouse brought against Bill Clinton, perjury before a grand jury and obstructionof justice. A trial that will probably include live witnesses. As the paperswent to bed, the witness question remained unresolved, but indications are thata list of between 8 and 15 persons to be subpoenaed will be approved.            But apparently the procedural discussions are far from over. For instance,the WP reports that the White House or Senate Democrats might start outthe trial by offering a motion to dismiss, requiring only a simple majority toprevail. The paper also observes that if the House trial managers get to calllive witnesses, the White House may want to do so as well, with Linda Tripp andLucianne Goldberg the most likely candidates. The Wall Street Journal also makes this point, but quotes Sen.Christopher Dodd saying that once the door is open to calling witnesses, thedanger is that the Senate yields control of the proceedings to the White Houseand the House GOP. The NYT reports that Clinton's lawyers have offeredto stipulate to certain evidence in return for an abbreviated trial. No word onwhich evidence, though. The Post says the president's strategistsbelieve the witnesses likely to be called--Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, andBetty Currie--may not be that problematic because none is hostile to Clinton.But the NYT quotes a spokesman for Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle saying,"Our position continues to be no witnesses." On the other hand, USATreports that the 55 Senate Republicans met Wednesday night and voted forwitnesses by a 4-1 margin.            A big story that broke in yesterday's WP and Boston Globe wasinadvertently omitted from yesterday's TP (without getting too specific, let'sjust say it had something to do with either a faulty T1 line/browser interfaceor too much wine with dinner): namely that UN weapons inspectors in Iraq had infact been doing something that Saddam Hussein had long accused themof--providing the U.S. government with intelligence information notrelated to their assigned task. Today's Post reports that inresponse, Clinton administration officials acknowledge that the U.S. hadreceived intel from the inspectors, but that this was only a "byproduct" oftheir inspection chores. The NYT has U.S. officials saying somethingstronger: that American spies worked undercover on the UN teams. The WSJgives chase too, reporting that UN inspectors employed a sophisticatedeavesdropping device that automatically transmitted signals from SaddamHussein's communications network to the U.S. National Security Agency. Thedeal, says the paper, was that the inspectors did this in return for gettingworked-up information back from the NSA relevant to where and how Iraq washiding evidence of its weapons programs. The Post reports that the headUN weapons inspector, Richard Butler, has issued a blanket denial of the spyingcharges.            In the WSJ 's other bit of detailed intelligence reporting for theday, the paper claims that China received secret design information for themost modern U.S. nuclear warhead, the one that sits atop the submarine-launchedTrident II ICBM, and that U.S. officials suspect an American scientist workingat a Department of Energy lab. The incident occurred in the mid-1980s and wasonly discovered in 1995. The FBI is still investigating. There is debate aboutwhat China has done with the purloined information, but, says theJournal , in the mid-nineties, it did test a warhead similar to theTrident's.            A WSJ headline proclaims that "Disney CEO Eisner's Bonus Was CutNearly 50% Due to Mediocre Earnings." But in the second paragraph the readerlearns this means Eisner received a 1998 bonus of $5 million. That'll teachhim.
