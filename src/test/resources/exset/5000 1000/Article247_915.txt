                                 The Affirmative Action Wars, Part 37            The backlash against William G. Bowen and Derek Bok's The Shape of theRiver , a liberal defense of affirmative action, has kicked into gear, andmuch of it won't surprise you. There's the attacker: Abigail Thernstrom,co-author (with her husband Stephan) of America in Black and White: OneNation, Indivisible and one of the loudest opponents of affirmative actionaround. There's the venue: the Wall Street Journal editorial page.There's the old juggle-with-numbers. Is a 75 percent graduation rate for blacksat top colleges proof of the success of race-sensitive admissions or of itsfailure? Proof of success, according to Bowen and Bok; proof of failure,according to Thernstrom. The white graduation rate is 86 percent, so shereconfigures the stats to show that blacks have a dropout rate that's 78percent higher for blacks than for whites.            But Thernstom's main argument is original. She says an education at an elitecollege doesn't matter as much as everyone says it does, so elite collegesshouldn't work so hard to admit more blacks. Bowen and Bok claim we needaffirmative action from top schools because that's what created the blackmiddle class in the first place? Not so fast! says Thernstrom: "Where are theircontrol groups, demonstrating in some rigorous fashion that the equallyacademically strong, ambitious and discipline black student who attends theUniversity of South Carolina instead of Oberlin does less well in life?"Lacking hard data, Thernstrom supplies anecdotal evidence: a list of blacks whodid well in life even though they didn't go to Princeton or Penn. It includesCynthia Tucker, editorial writer at the Atlanta Constitution , who wentto Auburn University; Clarence Page, a columnist for the ChicagoTribune , who went to Ohio; Brent Staples of the New York Times , whowent to Widener, Vernon Jordan, who went to Depauw; and so on.            Leaving aside the little hooks that ripple this flowing counternarrative ofsuccess, like the fact that Staples went to graduate school at the Universityof Chicago, Culturebox is charmed by a certain self-inverting quality toThernstrom's argument. If like her we believe in strict formal equality in allthings (rather than remedies to past discrimination), and black people don'tneed fancy schools to do well in life, why should we think white people needthem either? Think of the current master of the universe, Disney chief MichaelEisner, who graduated from Denison, a university in Granville, Ohio. Or StevenSpielberg, who never graduated at all. But if white people don't need degreesfrom tony colleges to succeed, why do Thernstrom and her cohorts care so muchabout these schools' efforts to level the playing field? The better strategywould be to cede it altogether, leaving blacks to enjoy their Pyrric victory.More fools they, that they believe in the power of a Harvard education!            Thernstrom sent her daughter, Melanie Thernstrom, to Harvard, so we know shedoesn't accept the unintended consequences of her own argument. But thatdoesn't undermine her case entirely. Thernstrom is translating for broadconsumption a debate raging among economists. It is widely known that there isa huge economic return on higher education in general. The question is: Isthere a bigger one on an education at an elite school? In other words, does itmatter where you went to college or that you went to college?            In purely economic terms, it turns out, it matters only that you wentto college. But pure economics doesn't explain why people like Thernstrom careso much about getting their kids into Harvard. The answer is that a Harvardeducation does more than get your child into the middle-class, or even theupper-middle class. It plugs your child directly into a network of people whomake up what used to be called the Establishment--which is exactly whereThernstrom would want her daughter to be.            -- Judith Shulevitz
