                                 Thanks--a Lott            USAT and the LAT lead with a Supreme Court decision placing new restrictionson credit union membership. The WP leads with Kenneth Starr's latestanimadversions. And the NYT goes with Sen. Trent Lott's call for the rejectionof the Kofi Annan-brokered accord with Iraq.            The USAT , LAT and WSJ pieces (as well as a piece on the frontof the NYT national edition) explain that the credit union decisiondecides a simmering conflict between those organizations and banks in favor ofthe latter. Banks had been claiming that credit unions, which enjoy tax-exemptstatus based on their origins as volunteer-run cooperatives, have, by wildlyexpanding their memberships beyond simple company or vocational affiliation (71million members, more than double the 1991 total), been able to unfairlycompete for customers. Yesterday, by a 5-4 vote, the Court agreed, even thoughconsumer advocates complain that this portends bad news for customers, who'vebenefited from the downward fee pressures credit unions provide.            The LAT credit union effort attributes a quotation to "the AmericanBankers Assn. and four other banking groups." Not to a spokesman for thoseorganizations, but to the groups themselves. "Today's Papers" guesses this is atelltale sign of writing the reaction part of the story from a press release.It would be far better to interview an actual person instead, if only becauseyou can't ask a press release follow-up questions.            The WP lead reports that yesterday, Starr lashed out at the"avalanche of lies" spread about his staff and defended his decision tosubpoena Clinton loyalists to determine if they have been spreading derogatoryinformation about his office. Meanwhile, says the Post , his grand juryinvestigation focused on Monica Lewinsky's federal job history, with apotential wrangle over the possible invoking of executive privilege by certainsenior Clinton aides still on hold. The paper points out that the privilegeissue presents Starr with a Hobson's choice: fight the notion and divertsignificant resources to a long court battle, or don't fight it and forgo somekey witnesses.            The WP lead runs a new charge made by Monica Lewinsky's lawyerWilliam Ginsburg: Linda Tripp may have "manipulated tape-recordedconversations" she had with his client. The paper doesn't say whether thelawyer meant Tripp tricked ML into misstatements or physically edited the tapeto be misleading. It should have.            The Post does report that Lewinsky was offered $10,000 seed money fora legal defense fund by a benefactor whose foundation promotes the view thatwomen need to "use their sexuality" in the workplace to attract mentors.            According to the NYT , it looks as if Trent Lott was able to takeenough of a break from sabotaging campaign reform to try sabotaging the newIraq deal. Lott, reports the Times , urged President Clinton to rejectit, accusing the administration of abdicating its foreign policy to Kofi Annan.The Times pointedly observes that "Lott did not say in his speechWednesday what he would have done if he were in the president's position.."            The NYT front carries a chilling "special report" about the U.N.weapons inspectors' hunt for Iraq's germ warfare arsenal. The piece flatlystates that Iraq has run an elaborate germ weapons program and that it "hadmade enough deadly microbes to kill all the people on earth several timesover." There's also the revelation of a crash military program intended tocreate the ability for Iraq to wipe out Israel's population with anthraxmicrobes.            The WP and LAT fronts describe how, within the past elevendays, computer hackers have broken into unclassified Pentagon networks toexamine and possibly alter payroll and personnel data.            Sure, the school bus is crawling with safety violations and doesn't containseat belts and will be taking the kids to classrooms run by teachers who neveractually had to take the subjects they're teaching, but at least according tothe WSJ "Business Bulletin," in a few years there will besatellite-based technology available to families that will let them know to thesecond exactly when the bus is arriving.
