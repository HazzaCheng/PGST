                                 Two Scoops!            The New YorkTimes leads with the day's biggest scoop. President Clinton's State ofthe Union address will introduce a carrot-and-stick funding program to improveelementary and secondary schools. The Washington Post leads with a scooplet--thepresident's lawyers will challenge some of the facts gathered by Kenneth Starr.The                Los AngelesTimes               ,                USAToday               , and Wall Street Journal have no scoops at all, andare left to report what the senators said on Sunday's political talk shows.(The WP informs that fully one-fifth of the Senate--19senators--appeared on the Sunday shows.)            The NYT's State of the Union article--which may of course prove to bea trial balloon--says that Clinton wants to tie federal funds to whetherschools test their teachers. So-called "social promotions"--promotingunqualified students from grade to grade so they stay with their peers--will bediscouraged as well. Finally, Clinton and his speechwriters also intend todiscuss Social Security, unveil a plan to safeguard Russia's nukes, and beef upUS defenses against biological weapons attacks. The president's speech(scheduled for Tuesday) will not directly address his legal troubles since hehopes to shift voters' attentions away from the impeachment trial. Predictably,the NYT story is sourced to "White House officials" and "aides" in thefirst few paragraphs; oddly enough, it quotes Bruce Reed (Clinton's chiefdomestic policy advisor) by name at the end.            The WP reports that the president's lawyers plan on a "fact-driven"defense, which means challenging the Starr report's specific allegations ratherthan arguing that none of the allegations warrant removal. All papers reportthat most senators expect witnesses to be called. Democratic senators arethreatening to call Kenneth Starr as a witness.            The international lead is that the Yugoslav army is attacking the town inKosovo where 45 ethnic Albanians were executed on Friday. Needless to say, thefighting and the massacre are signs of a breakdown in the cease-fire agreementsigned four months ago. NATO has condemned Milosevic but chooses not to bombhim.            On what would have been Rev. Martin Luther King's 70th birthday, most papersrun several King-related stories. The WP presents a vignette of life onWashington D.C.'s Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue ("Life and death, faith anddespair, violence and a tenuous brand of peace coexist"). The NYT runs astory on Jews and blacks as well as a William Safire column recounting the timehe, a young press agent, organized a press conference for the then obscureKing. Roy Cohn warned Safire that the FBI thought King a "commie"; MortonJanklow advised Safire to ignore Cohn. Shelby Steele in the WSJ arguesthat King's rhetorical prowess made whites ashamed about this country's racialhistory, unwittingly encouraging liberal whites to feel "responsible" forblacks, which prevents blacks from becoming truly free. Steele thinks Kingshould be revisited as a man who "made freedom first of all a blackresponsibility."            The WP reports on a Boulder, Colorado company that is designing a"robokoneko" ("robot kitten" in Japanese). Why a kitten? Because baby cats are"cute, media-friendly" says the robokoneko's designer. Apparently the kitten's"brain" will actually build itself--programmers write mini-programs that areable to build new mini-programs which will eventually fuse into a simulacrum ofa kitten's thought process. The end-program will ultimately be strapped to aworking wire-and-steel kitten. The WP warns that this robotic cat maynot "walk between your legs as you go down the stairs"--the article doesn'tactually specify how this robot will be cat-like at all--but readers can restassured that the final product will be readily convertible into 1) aself-directed housecleaning robot or 2) a Mars rover. (No kidding.)
