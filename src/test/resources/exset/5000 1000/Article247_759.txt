                                 <I>Monica's Choice</I>            The New York Times leads with more tough words from the U.S.about Iraq, but the Los Angeles Times is the only other paper to front the Iraqstory at all. The Washington Post 's top national story analyzes the stockmarket's resurgence. USAToday goes with the Supreme Court's decision not to consider twocampaign finance reform cases. And the LAT leads with an analysis of the$206 billion proposed settlement between the states and tobacco companies.            The NYT lead says that the U.S. and Britain are highly skeptical ofSaddam Hussein's compliance and that "there was an unusually strong consensusMonday that American and British bombing was almost inevitable." The real test,says the Times , should come in a few weeks when surprise weaponsinspections begin. British Prime Minister Tony Blair echoed the ClintonAdministration's strongly worded sentiments; next time, Blair said, there willbe "no warnings, no wrangling, no negotiations, no last-minute letters."American and British forces could be deployed within hours of any decision toattack. Other interesting stories from the NYT 's Iraq package reportthat 1) President Clinton's decision to terminate the Iraq strike came just 15minutes before the missiles were to launch; and 2) The French are miffed atSen. John McCain for insinuating that France tipped Saddam Hussein off to theimminent attack. McCain remarked of the attack plan, "We had to inform ourallies, including the French."            The LAT tobacco suit story notes that if the case is settled, "theindustry got off relatively cheaply in strict financial terms." Smokersthemselves, rather than the industry, will essentially shoulder the $206billion cost through 35-cents-per-pack price increases; the LAT saysthat this is not enough to seriously dampen consumption. Health advocates havealready criticized the settlement as too lax, but the state attorneys generalare eager to settle and get the money. For the settlement to take effect,states representing 80% of the nation's Medicare patients must sign byFriday.            The USAT lead, tucked inside elsewhere, says that the Supreme Courtelected not to hear cases from Ohio and Arkansas about campaign finance reform.USAT emphasizes that prospects for spending reform by the 2000 electionsnow seem remote, as Congress is generally disinclined to pass the necessarylegislation.            The WP off-lead about the soaring stock market is buoyed by Tuesday'sfigures, when the Dow finished above 9000 for the first time since July--18%higher than it was October 1st. Factors in the market rise, says thePost , include interest rate cuts, high corporate earnings, and thewaning prospect of Clinton's impeachment. However, doubts linger as to whetherthe market can maintain its course in the face of the global economiccrisis.            The Wall StreetJournal fronts a terrific story on the Fed's arduous decision-makingprocess. The Fed's announcements and hints on forthcoming interest rate movesare pegged to a delicate PR dance; one ill-timed or misunderstood word can flipmarkets. The WSJ paints Alan Greenspan as a highly autonomous operator;he "makes major policy changes only at FOMC meetings--partly so the Fed doesn'tlook like the one-man show it often is." Another Fed decision on interest ratecuts is coming today.            Monica Lewinsky has signed a book deal with St. Martin's Press, a storyfronted everywhere but the WP (which gives it to "Style") and theLAT . The book (working title: "Monica's Story) will be ghost-written byAndrew Morton, the author of a best-selling Princess Diana book. It could comeout as early as February, says the WP . All papers note that Monica'sauthor fee is unexpectedly modest--the NYT says it's just $600,000 plusbestseller bonuses. For free, Monica also has agreed to a television interviewwith Barbara Walters of ABC. A date has not been set, as Lewinsky is stillironing out with Kenneth Starr's office the legal nuances of a mediaappearance, but the NYT guesses February. The WP says thatLewinsky may haul in a seven-figure sum for a separate TV deal to be broadcastoutside the U.S.            From the Slate self-reference corner: A NYT "Business" pieceanalyzes Slate 's Microsoft trial coverage, sayingthat irreverent descriptions of jowly Microsoft lawyers by Slate 'sinaugural courtroom correspondent, Michael Lewis, "seemed mightily unfetteredby Microsoft." "Today's Papers," who also edits Slate 's "Email to theEditor," recommends the piece to the legions of you out there who sent incomments about the trial coverage.
