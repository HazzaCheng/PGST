                                 Why Johnny Can't Need                           USAToday , the Los Angeles Times and the New York Timeslead with Slobodan Milosevic's promise to withdraw his forces from Kosovo inthe face of threatened NATO airstrikes. The Washington Post lead covers Congress' latest moves in itsattempts to arrive at a budget, stressing the tentative approval by key Houseand Senate Republicans of President Clinton's requested $18 billion for theIMF. The death of the gay student who was kidnapped and beaten in Wyoming grabsfront space at the NYT , LAT , and USAT , and is the subjectof the NYT 's lead editorial, which points out that Wyoming, like nineother states, has no hate-crime laws.            The papers report that even though Milosevic agreed to back out of Kosovo,NATO yesterday authorized airstrikes against him that could begin in four daysif he doesn't actually do that. They also report that in the meantime, about2,000 airborne and ground-based allied inspectors--including some Americancivilians and, say the LAT and NYT , some Russians--will verifythat Milosevic's Serbian troops have indeed pulled back, allowing Albanians toreturn to their homes. If this doesn't happen, the NATO air plan to beimplemented would begin with cruise missiles and progress to a full bombingcampaign. The LAT says that each stage of the plan could be flown onlyafter being approved by NATO's ambassadors (something the NYT says isnot clear) and that only military facilities would be targeted. The NYTaccount stresses more than the others the resistance of the Russians to theairstrike plan.            The WP reports that House Republicans have extracted something inreturn for infusion of fresh U.S. billions into IMF coffers: 1) a promise bymajor IMF contributors to push the agency to require above-market rates andreasonably short repayment periods for its loans (to lessen high-risk borrowingin aided countries); 2) a requirement that the IMF release written summaries ofits board meetings and other major documents within three months. The papersays that the White House and the Hill are close on a number of the remainingbudget issues, including a Clinton plan to spend $1.1 billion to hire 100,000new teachers. But since agreements have not yet been reached, Congress passedanother short-term funding bill-- the third since October 1st--to tide thegovernment over for a few more days.            Another budget story on the Post front addresses the thirty or soline items that appear in print for the first time in the $250 billion defensebill Congress just passed--so-called "virgin births." The list this year,reports the Post , includes $250,000 to study the tactical applicationsof caffeinated chewing gum.            The papers report that the Nobel Prize in Medicine goes this year to threeAmericans who discovered that nitric oxide (not, the papers admonish, nitrousoxide, which is laughing gas), known best as an air pollutant, is also producedin the body, where it regulates blood pressure, nerve firing, and immuneresponses. The Post waits until the third paragraph of its story tomention that nitric oxide is central to the process of getting an erection andas such is a key element in the workings of Viagra. At the NYT ,erections make the second paragraph, Viagra the fifth. At the LAT Viagramakes the second paragraph, erections the 18th.            A Wall Street Journal front-page feature cites astrong consumer trend: the young children of boomers have buying habits that formerly wereassociated with adolescents. The piece quotes a finding that whileaggregate spending by or on behalf of children 4-12 roughly doubled everydecade between 1960-1980, in the 1990s, it has tripled. The money goes, saysthe Journal , to such surprises as fitness clubs and personal trainers,Delta Airlines pre-schoolers fliers club, and Liberty Financial's mutual fundfor children, which features a quarterly coloring book and a savings andinvesting bingo game. One suspicion-raising feature of the story: the threecities mentioned in vignettes are all upper-upper-end nearly-pure-white townswithin a radius of fifty miles of Los Angeles.
