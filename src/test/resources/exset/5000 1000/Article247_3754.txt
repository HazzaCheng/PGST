                                 Erudition vs. Sense                        Dear Alan:            Oh no, we agree! We've really got to stop this collaboration across thepolitical spectrum. At this rate, we'll be singing "We Shall Overcome" beforethis exchange is over. And what happens to the "culture wars" when people onboth sides start laying down their arms? This is terrible. In addition to hisother offenses, Edmund Morris is apparently the one we can blame for thisalarming development.            Before I resume my trashing of Morris, let me admit that Dutchcontains many passages that are beautifully written. As we saw in Morris'previous book, he can be quite a sculptor with words. And there are occasionalflashes of insight. For instance Morris almost casually notes that Reagan was"always happier in the Here and Now. His tendency to reminisce ... was not alooking back so much as an eager application of history to today and tomorrow."This is exactly right, and an apt response to many of Reagan's critics who haveover the years accused him of incurable nostalgia and trying to take thecountry back to the past that never was. Actually, Reagan could care less about"turning back the clock." He employed the imagery of the past (e.g. pioneersproceeding West in covered wagons) to construct a kind of imaginative portraitof America; then he worked relentlessly to bend the future (e.g. spaceexploration and entrepreneurship as the modern equivalent of the earlysettlers) to his vision and his will.            Morris admires Reagan's imagination and will; it's Reagan's intellect andcultural taste he cannot help but disdain. Sample passage: "Like Charles Ryderin Brideshead Revisited , Reagan found himself homeless, middle-aged andloveless as his thirty-ninth year waned. Or, to quote a book he was more likelyto have read, there was this passage in Kings Row ..." Morris's bookis full of this kind of snobbery.            But once again, let me raise the question of who is the real sophisticateand who is the ignoramus. I don't deny that Morris is a better connoisseur ofwine and literature than Reagan. But when statesmanship requires that the chasmbetween ideas and action be bridged, Reagan's genius becomes evident and Morrisreveals himself to be, well, a complete idiot.            For instance, here is Morris' criticism of Reagan's famous "Mr. Gorbachev,Tear Down This Wall" speech, drafted by speechwriter Peter Robinson and stagedbefore an enthusiastic crowd at the Brandenburg Gate. After a sneering accountof Reagan's remarks that entirely misses their political significance, Morriswrites,                           What a rhetorical opportunity missed. He could have read Robert Frost's poemon the subject, 'Something there is that doesn't love a wall,' to simple andshattering effect. Or even Edna St. Vincent Millay's lines ... 'Only now forthe first time I see/ This wall is actually a wall, a thing/ Come up betweenus, shutting me away/ From you ... I do not know you any more.'                        Is Morris kidding us here? Or has erudition drowned out all good sense? Isuppose Edna Millay would be fitting in this context if Reagan were trying tostrike up a romantic relationship with Gorbachev. The Frost example is evenworse. Morris seems to have totally missed the point of Frost's poem, whichconcludes with the observation that good fences make good neighbors. WouldReagan have been better off saying, "Mr. Gorbachev, good fences make goodneighbors"? Thank you, speechwriter Edmund Morris! And now: off to the insaneasylum!            Alan, perhaps you and some readers will consider me unduly harsh, but Ithink I am being duly harsh. Morris may be a wordsmith and an aesthete, but heis politically incompetent to evaluate his subject, a thoroughly political man.And he has missed an opportunity that cannot be recovered: Morris had a levelof continuous access to Reagan that no other writer will ever have. He hasabrogated his moral responsibility to history in a manner that is close tounforgivable. Which leaves the big question: Who picked this guy? And why?            Best,Dinesh
