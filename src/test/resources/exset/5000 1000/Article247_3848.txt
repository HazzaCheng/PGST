                                 Write Two Pages and Call Me in the Morning                        Good morning, Jesse:            An article from the Chicago Tribune , reprinted in the San JoseMercury News , refers to a study reported in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association that concludes writing may be beneficial for yourhealth. Now, that's what I call news. According to JAMA , physiciansconducting the study asked subjects suffering from acute asthma or fromrheumatoid arthritis to write for 20 minutes a day for three consecutive days.They were asked not to concern themselves with the niceties of spelling,punctuation, and so on. They were told instead, just write and write and write,what we call in the profession free-writing, I suppose.            A significant number of study subjects reported that their symptoms improvedwith writing. This of course is good news. But even better is the prospect thatfuture studies may go on to show that writing may actually cure much of whatails us (except for writing-induced ailments like carpal tunnel syndrome or, ifyou're still using a pencil, writer's bump--that unsightly callus on your indexfinger caused by holding a writing implement).            I'm not sure what the controls were for the JAMA study. Were an equalnumber of volunteers asked to not write for 20 minutes for three consecutivedays? Did their symptoms then worsen, or remain the same? I know my ownsymptoms would worsen if I were told not to write, since I write all the time.But let's look at this                   Slate                discussion for an example ofhealthful praxis: I'm writing for more than 20 minutes twice a day for whatwill be four days. Should I be taking my pulse and blood pressure regularly?Should I not use my inhaler? (Actually, I do have an inhaler, but seldom needto use it.) What should I expect to see happening? To whom do I report theresults? Will my HMO cover this?            OK, you get my drift. I'm not convinced that writing holds promise as aprophylactic. There have been a number of "scientific" studies like this onethat deal with language-related subjects but that are not really linguisticstudies. A few years back (hey, this is still on topic--I'm an English teacher,so I should know), there was some discussion in the press about the discoveryof a grammar gene by neurologists. This was based on a study of an extendedMontreal family, many of whose members exhibited certain curiosities in theirgrammar: They could not form certain kinds of sentences, couldn't answerquestions, couldn't write clearly, and so on. It was held, in these popularreports, that the discovery of the shared defective gene seen to cause thesymptoms would eventually lead to a cure not only for dyslexia but for freshmancomposition--perhaps even for government prose. Guess what, folks? It didn'thappen. It seems that writing, and grammar, are too complex to be controlled bya single gene. And disease is too complex, I'm guessing, to be palliated byjournal writing.            That is not to say that people don't or won't find writing to be beneficial.As an English teacher and a linguist, and a writer, I've been advocatingwriting as good mental exercise for as long as I can remember. Of course, I wasa sickly child, and one who wrote all the time. What does that tell us? Nothingabout writing, or health, actually.            But once people read about the physical benefits that accrue from writing,I'm sure that writing clinics will spring up in California, land of all goodfads, or if the JAMA study is discredited and writing clinics areoutlawed, then they will spring up in Mexico. I predict that the sick will makea pilgrimage to these clinics, perhaps even swarming to our own writers'workshop, where student writers get help with their term-paper assignments.Will writing become a remedy of the desperate, like grapefruit diets, coffeeenemas, Krebiozen, copper bracelets--or does it work more like meditation,prayer, or even beta carotenes? Will the FDA start controlling writing? Willthere be minimum recommended doses? Warning labels on keyboards?            I guess I'm satisfied that writing is good for you, won't cure a thing, andanyway, writers seem not to have a choice in the matter: To paraphrase thewords of Gene Kelly, we just gotta write, gotta write ...
