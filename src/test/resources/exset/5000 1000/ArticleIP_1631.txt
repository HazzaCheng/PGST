                                                            Yoknapatawpha TV                        This yearmarks the centennial of William Faulkner's birth and the Web release of some ofhis lost hack work. A graduate student at the University of Illinois atSpringfield stumbled upon two teleplays by the Nobel Prize-winningauthor--Faulkner's only known forays into the genre--while researching hismaster's thesis, Yoknapatawpha                TV , at a Duke University archive.The teleplays, adaptations of undistinguished short stories by the author,aired in 1953 and 1954 on Lux Video Theatre , a dramatic series sponsoredby the makers of Lux soap. To appease censors, Faulkner eliminated a suicidefrom The                Brooch , and to update the appeal of Shall NotPerish , he changed the setting from World War II to the Korean War. Thefirst pages of both teleplays are available on the Web but, as a columnist in the Raleigh, N.C.,News & Observer remarked, "based on the response of critics,Faulkner might have wished these scripts had remained lost."                           Red,White, and Tawny                        It iscommonly taught that Europeans invented the concept of race and color-coded theworld's peoples. Not according to Nancy Shoemaker, an assistant professor ofhistory at the University of Wisconsin at Eau-Claire. In the June issueof American Historical Review , she debunks the standard accounts of howthe American Indians became "red." (Traditional explanations include Europeanencounters with Indians wearing red paint, or else the creative labeling systemof 18 th -century Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus.) Shoemakercites English and French diplomats' diaries and treaty records from the 1720sto argue that American Indian tribes came up with the label themselves. Thetranscript of a peace treaty between the Chickasaws and the Cherokees in 1726,for example, features the phrase "red people" only within speeches by Indiandelegates. Besides, Shoemaker writes, Europeans at the time usually describedIndians not as red but as "tawny."                           PeteSampras' Secret                        RodCross, a tennis-obsessed Australian physicist, went to the lab to figure outthe science behind Pete Sampras' power serve. Top players have found that thebest serve comes from the tip of the racket. But why? Cross put his own racketin a vise grip and hooked it up to instruments designed to measure the bounceof a ball dropped from 50 centimeters onto the strings at various points. Hefound, as he reports in the American Journal of Physics , that Sampras'famous serve is generated by a "dead spot" five centimeters from the tip of theracket, where the ball doesn't bounce at all. The explanation is basic physics:At the dead spot, 100 percent of the ball's energy is transferred to theracket, which, were it in full swing on a tennis court, would return the energyto the ball, guaranteeing a power serve. For returns, however, the dead spot isno good; it would just absorb all the ball's energy.                           Bravingthe Elements                        Twentyyears of Cold War bickering over who gets to name certain disputed elements ofthe periodic table has ended in a compromise befitting the new world order--oralmost. According to a recent article in Science , Americans, Russians,and Germans all claimed proprietary rights to the elements 104 to 110 untillast month, when the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry("chemistry's high court") handed down its decisions. The Americans will claimelements 104 (rutherfordium, after physicist Ernest Rutherford) and 106(seaborgium, after nuclear physicist Glen Seaborg); the Russians get element105 (dubnium, after the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia);and the Germans 107 to 109 (respectively bohrium, after Danish quantumphysicist Niels Bohr; hassium, after the German state of Hesse, where it wasdiscovered; and meitnerium, after German physicist Lise Meitner). Element 110remains under dispute.                           Poetryfor Lawyers                        Who saysa creative-writing MFA is a sure path to permanent unemployment?
