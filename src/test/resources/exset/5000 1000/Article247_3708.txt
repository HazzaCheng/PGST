                                 Whither the Intelligentsia?                        Dear Nat,            The problem with the educated elite is that nobodystays put. In the past 48 hours The Atlantic hasbeen purchased and the wonderful Michael Kelly has been installed as editor inchief (another blow to the old Protestant Establishment and another victory forthe ethnics), and Chuck Lane has been deposed as editor of the New Republic and Peter Beinart has been put in. I was with Beinartall yesterday at a conference in Maine. He was pulled out for an urgent call atone point, but he didn't say a word about how his life had been changed. Somuch discretion in one so young. Amazing.            I will be gossiping about these maneuverings and thecurrent ridiculous smears against Gary Bauer all day, but I suppose here weshould rise to a higher sphere and talk literature. I wanted to take advantageof your presence here and ask you about the form of this book, rather than thecontent. Lemann has written his analysis of the meritocracy as a narrative.Meanwhile, both of us are frustrated because the analytical or polemicalconclusion to his book is so short. It seems to me this is characteristic ofbook writing these days. We are in a great age of nonfiction narrative writing.There have been many great biographies written over the past couple of decades(Edmund Morris gets credit for writing one of them--his T.R. book), and therehave been several great narrative non-fiction books. Richard Ben Cramer'sWhat It Takes comes to mind. Lemann himself is anaccomplished author of narratives.            But when I look back at my favorite period of Americannonfiction--the period between 1950 and 1965--the books that leap out were notnarratives. Many great and influential books were written during that time:The Rise and Fall of Great American Cities ,The Organization Man , TheProtestant Establishment , Silent Spring ,The Feminist Mystique , TheLonely Crowd (which you worked on, I believe), TheCultural Contradictions of Capitalism , The Machinein the Garden , The Image --I could go on and on...            My impression is that in the '60s and '70s thereweren't as many influential, popular but intellectual books of that sort. Therewere a few-- The Rise of the Counterculture andThe Culture of Narcissism come to mind, but not asmany. (To avoid looking like a flatterer I'm leaving your stuff likeBeyond the Melting Pot out of this). Then in the'80s, a new wave of nonfiction successes hit the best-seller lists. These werepolemical conservative books, Losing Ground ,The Closing of the American Mind , Wealth and Poverty , and so on. There was a time for a decade or sowhen every week's bestseller list had at least one right-wing polemic onit.            But that phase, too, is over. Now the most notablenonfiction books are celebrity books or narratives. I think some of this has todo with the declining prestige of the intellectual. In the '50s and early '60s,it seems to me, intellectuals were confident of their social roles. There werefigures like Hannah Arendt, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Edmund Wilson doing theirthing. Journalists like Jane Jacobs and for a time Daniel Bell still followedan intellectual model when writing their books.            But somehow the intelligentsia, in the Russian sense,lost its confidence and broad vision over the next decades. Academics starteddoing more professionalized stuff that people like me never read. Andjournalists started doing narratives and biographies, like Lemann or SamTanenhaus or J. Anthony Lukas.            The narratives make for better reads, but I do missthose big upper-middle-brow books like Daniel Bell and Jane Jacobs used towrite. Or more properly, I wish that the books that follow in that traditionwere getting more attention and more sales these days. Maybe people have lessfaith in the social sciences as well and so just want to hear about stories andpersonalities.            Anyway, I'm just conjecturing about all this, but youhave been active during this whole period. Is my description of the trends innonfiction accurate? Do you have an explanation?            All the best,David
