                                 Easy Ryder                           Movies                                                         Girl, Interrupted                (Columbia Pictures). Excellent performancesfrom the two leads, Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, lift this movie above thethicket of clichs it veers toward. Based on the best-selling memoirs ofSusanna Kaysen, it follows a confused teen-age girl who checks herself into amental institution and then finds that she can't check out. Although many notethat this is "a junior-league One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest " (OwenGleiberman, Entertainment Weekly ) and that the film lapses into tritebattles between patients and hospital staff, the film stays mainly on target,at its best when displaying its "meticulous, true-to-life portrait of a time(the late 1960's) and place (the hothouse world of upper-middle-class Bostonsuburbia)" (Stephen Holden, the New York Times ).

The critics gripe a bit but stillgive a standing ovation to Mike Leigh's ( Secrets and Lies ) new film,about a short span in the lives and work of Gilbert and Sullivan as theycompose and stage The Mikado . "Only a lunatic would callTopsy-Turvy , with its lame first hour and host of loose ends, amasterpiece, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed" (DavidEdelstein,                   Slate               ). It's "one of those films that create a mix oferudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much asShakespeare in Love did last year," and it "vigorously and amusinglyexplore[s] what it means for an artist to renew his energies by returning tosquare one" (Janet Maslin, the New York Times ). Several note its slowstart and general disorganization: "[I]t teases us with the feeling that Leighhad a basic plan for the picture and never realized it" (Stanley Kauffmann, theNew Republic ).

Jane Campion's ( The Piano ) latest offering draws divergentreactions, most tending toward the negative. Either it's "clumsy, lumpy" (JoeMorgenstern, the Wall Street Journal ), or the sparring of co-stars KateWinslet and Harvey Keitel (as a cult member and her deprogrammer) makes for afilm that "creates more man-woman electricity than any other movie this year"(Mike Clark, USA Today ). The film's core, a showdown between Keitel andWinslet, is "a knockabout fusion of sexual warfare, New Age therapy,cross-generational Socratic dialogue, and feminist role reversal" (OwenGleiberman, Entertainment Weekly ). Mentioned in nearly every review: 1)Winslet bares all; 2) Keitel ends up in a red dress and lipstick. (Clickhere to watch thetrailer.)                                             Tumbleweeds                (Fine Line Features). The secondfree-spirit-mom-on-the-run-with-teen-age-daughter story in three monthsreceives much better reviews than the first ( Anywhere But Here ): It"impresses with its freshly considered action and total avoidance of the staleand routine" (Jay Carr, the Boston Globe ). British stage actress JanetMcTeer's performance as the mother stands out, and the low-budget, genuinefeeling of the film results in "one of the few movies ever made that doesn'tfeel like a movie," in which the characters "throb and course with life"(Stephen Hunter, the Washington Post ).

Critics seem to think so. Always read"more for his trend-setting insights than his novelistic dexterity," he loseshis hipster cred with this novel "by jumping on the already tiredbeauty-pageant-bashing bandwagon" ( Publishers' Weekly ). Even worse, "hisbrand labels are just slightly faded," and the story feels "curiously clippedand uptight" (Tom Shone, the New York Times ). On a more positive note,many also point out that despite his faux pas, Coupland has put together "abrilliant set of riffs" on pop culture and Hollywood life (James Poniewozik,Time ).
