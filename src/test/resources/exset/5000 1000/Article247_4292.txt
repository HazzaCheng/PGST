                                 It Ain't Broke ...                        Dear Jim,            "American Journalism in Crisis." It sounds like the title to any number ofPew Charitable Trust seminars, doesn't it? But I don't really buy it. To theseweary eyes, American journalism has never been smarter and more accurate thanit is today. Not perfect, mind you, or tweezer-headed nitpicking press criticslike you and me would have nothing to carp about. But I'll put today'snewspapers up against the newspapers of any era you can name.            And never in the history of American journalism has the media been morescrutinized. Just look at the list of media critics listed in the right gutterof the MediaGossip.com Web site! Or at the Draconian investigations ofthe press conducted by Special Counsel Steve Brill. There's hardly a conflictof interest or press indiscretion that goes unexamined these days.            While it's true that newspaper audiences are shrinking, that decline hasnothing to do with the imagined crisis that Rosen warns about in What AreJournalists For? The newspaper audience and the number of daily newspapershave been steadily shrinking since the advent of radio in the 1920s, and everytime a new technology rolls into the mix--TV, cable, the VCR, satellite, videogames, the Internet--the audience contracts a wee bit more. A lot of thenewspapers that folded were rotten and deserved to die, a sentiment that manyleft-wing press critics will endorse. And while I can cite no academic study,I'd wager that today's average citizen who looks at the Sunday newspaper or anewsmagazine, listens to all-news radio stations during his commute, andcatches a little TV news and talk radio at home is better informed than hiscounterpart from any era of Rosen's choosing. If a newspaper isn't thrivingthese days, it might have to do with the fact that it isn't paying attention tothe way people live.            At the same time, I believe that the appetite for serious journalism hasgrown. The best marker of this trend is the popularity of national dailynewspapers such as the Wall Street Journal and the New YorkTimes , and TV shows such as 60 Minutes and Nightline . Eventhe post-Neuharth USA Today shines brighter than most papers fromearlier eras. ( USA Today 's dirty little secret is that it invented Webjournalism 20 years ago: Succinct stories; dazzling graphics; nice weather map;up-to-date ball scores; gossip; breaking news; regional info dumps; userfriendly interface--i.e., a newspaper that is in touch with the way people livenow.)            To your point that campaign 2000 coverage is poor, focusing on trivialmatters--let's not automatically blame journalists. Take, for example, the twoDemocrats running for president, whose political differences can be measuredwith a micromicrometer. How would you have reporters cover that contest anydifferently than they are now?            Let me toss one more idea on the fire as I walk out the door: The notionthat journalists have "lost touch with their communities" is utter bunk. It'sbeen at least a generation since the majority of the newspaper audience hailedfrom the lunch-pail and straphanger crowd. Today's readers, like today'sjournalists, are better-educated and more skeptical about institutions thanwere their mothers, fathers, and grandparents. And one of the institutions thatthey're exceedingly skeptical about--bless their hearts--is the press. This isjournalism's golden age.            Hey, seeing as we both punched our tickets at alternative weeklies, you atthe Village Voice and me at Washington City Paper and SFWeekly , maybe we should talk about what daily newspapers could learn fromthe alties. Many of the public journalism innovations that Rosen wantsnewspapers to experiment with--commitment to the community, initiating"dialogues" with the citizenry, and abandoning objectivity--are practicedroutinely at 100 papers in the nation's 50 top markets. (Readers can find alist of them at the Associationof Alternative Newsweeklies Web site.)            Regards,Jack
