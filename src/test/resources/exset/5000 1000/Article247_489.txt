                                 Presidents Just Wanna Have Funds                           USAToday leads with a look at the new federal and state tax breaks comingin with 1998. The Washington Post leads with President Clinton's decision toshut down his legal defense fund. The New York Timesgoes with the ban on smoking in bars that California puts in place tomorrow,mentioning the possible advent there of "smoke-ins" and "smoke-easy's." TheLosAngeles Times leads with word that a task force appointed by Gov. PeteWilson will call for increased state oversight of HMOs to make them morepatient-oriented.            The WP reveals that Clinton's decision to shut down his defense fund wasprompted by controversy over the fund's implication in shady DNC fund-raisingpractices and by dwindling contributions.            The Clintons, says the paper, now have nearly $3 million in legal bills. Andthe real story, which the Post buries deep and leaves out of theheadline, is that they are actively looking for a better way to raise the cash.The NYT , in its front-page coverage, does more justice to thisangle, mentioning it in the headline and in the story lead. Yesterday, theWP reports, Clinton said he'd asked the White House counsel to study theethical and legal requirements governing future fund-raising efforts. (Therebyexemplifying one dubious but legal cost-saving device he's making good use of:getting taxpayers to pay for research into what is essentially his privatelegal problem.) Sources tell the paper the Clintons have approved a new vehiclethat, it is hoped, will avoid the restrictions that kept the old trust fromsoliciting money for their use--by having it "independently" set up by somethird party. (Isn't it amazing how this triangulation can be discussed soopenly and still be legal?)            The WP and USAT (in its off-lead) say the lapsed defense fundhad not been used to pay for any legal expenses arising from the Paula Jonescase. The NYT says it had been used for some.            The LAT front reports that California's Latinos' longstandingreluctance to vote--a trend that has consistently kept them politicallyunder-represented there--appears to be changing.            The Wall Street Journal passes along word that millionairescontinue to proliferate. According to the latest available tax stats, in 1995there were 87,000 seven-figure earners in the U.S., an increase of 24 percentover 1994.            Both the NYT and WP run stories on a development sure to be cited inthis country by libertarians chafing against proposed Internet regulation:China's imposition today of stiff fines and prison sentences for distributionor consumption via the Net of "harmful information," defined as that which"defames government agencies," "impedes public order," or "damages stateinterests." Both providers and consumers can be held in violation.            Just in time, the WP seems to have come up with the Most AmazingHeadline of 1997. Amazing because true: "D.C. Woman Who Killed Daughter Is Awarded Custody of YoungSon." The woman, despite having been convicted of smothering her daughterin 1992 to stop her from crying, and who is still in prison after violating hersentence of probation (!) by engaging in credit card fraud, was nonethelessawarded custody by a judge citing the need of a child for his biological motherand his belief that because the boy is black, he'd be better off with his blackmother than with the white woman who filed papers to adopt him. Dear Reader,this is why judicial recall procedures were invented.                        Maureen Dowd adieus '97 with an interesting jeremiad against the 90s versionof vice. She notes that there now seems to be much more emphasis on say, beingseen drinking martinis and smoking cigars than in actually enjoying theactivities themselves. "Once," she notes, "martinis and cigars were stylishvices. Now they're vice-ish styles." And Dowd repeats a friend's observation:"The only reason they light up a cigar is because their mouths are too small tolight up a Porsche."            But Dowd must have had a little trouble making her word count: she hitsNexis (aka "Columnist Helper") pretty hard, filling out her wicked but simplepoint with quotes from Alexander Woolcott, P.G. Wodehouse, Paul Gigot and MaryMcGrory.            Back to that NYT California cigarette ban story: The Timesheadline writers missed a big chance: "Smoke Bar Bars Bar Smoke."
