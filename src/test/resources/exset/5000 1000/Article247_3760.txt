                                 TV's Mysterious Fascination With Young Adults                        The successful debut of Once and Again , the new drama (from thecreators of thirtysomething , no less) about having a love life as adivorced parent, has drawn plenty of hosannas from TV-watchers who feared thatthe tube had forever been given over to Dawson's Creek and its myriadclones. Once and Again 's success has been taken as a sign that a showdoesn't have to appeal to that desperately sought-after 18-to-34 demographic inorder to be a hit.            As it happens, Once and Again 's success doesn't necessarily show thatat all, because it is in fact a huge hit with the 18-to-34 audience. Its shareof TV-watchers in that group is as large as its overall share, and larger thanthe share received by new shows such as Freaks and Geeks and Now andAgain . In fact, Ed Zwick's show about yuppie parents is proving morepopular with the young'uns than his show about yuppie kids, My So-CalledLife .            What's weird, though, is the assumption Once and Again had to combatin order even to get on the air: that nothing is more desirable than those18-to-34 viewers. This is not an assumption unique to television. It'scertainly at work in movies, and has also been propelling changes in themagazine world, most notably in the ascent of pseudo-lad magazines likeMaxim and in the pressure that's being felt by older magazines to makethemselves more youth-friendly. But the fact that the assumption is ubiquitousdoesn't necessarily mean that it makes sense.            Now, I'm part of this fabled demographic, albeit at the high endchronologically, and in a lot of ways--willingness to consume, love of newstuff, appetite for pop culture of all kinds--I'm an ideal target foradvertisers. So I have no problem with TV programmers, Hollywood execs, andmagazine editors trying to appeal to me. But I am perplexed by the avidity withwhich I am being courted, because of one simple fact: There aren't that many ofme.            I don't mean that I'm unique. I mean that literally there are fewer--manyfewer--people in my generation than in the generations ahead of and behind us.And while it's certainly true that people in their late '20s and early '30s--atleast in cities, where those people are less likely to have families--have alot of disposable income, it can't compare, in absolute terms, to that stillwielded by the baby boomers. Even in the New Economy, earning power rises withage. Most people make a lot more when they're 40 than when they're 30.            So, why do advertisers think we're the ideal audience? Partly because of ourability to spend without worrying about our childrens' education; partlybecause some advertising is aspirational, so that you push products that peoplewill want to buy when they can afford to; and partly because of ill-consideredassumptions about brand loyalty, in particular the idea that if you hook me ona particular kind of car or suit or beer at 25, you'll have me for life.            But surely an important reason for the hegemony of the young-adult audienceis simply that young adults tend to be the ones who are buying advertisingtime, designing the ads, and, increasingly, writing and programming the showsand films that we see. I become the ideal consumer because my friends are theones selling me the products.            The picture is more complicated than this, of course. There aren't many21-year-olds, even today, writing ads for Chiat Day or programming for NBC.(Though I suspect there are a lot of 30-year-olds doing those jobs who thinkthey're still 21.) And I'm not sure if Dawson's Creek andFelicity are really targeted at 28-year-olds. (In fact, I pray theyaren't.) Finally, at the bottom end of the demographic, there a lot more peoplethan at the top end. Those are the oldest Echo Boomers, and advertisers shouldreally want them.            The point is not that the 18-to-34s should be disregarded. It's just thatfrom a purely economic point of view, they shouldn't be regarded with suchfascination. Last week, the combined ratings of Buffy the Vampire Slayerand Dawson's Creek added up to just 13 percent of all the people whowere watching television while those shows aired. And even a very stylish 13percent of all the customers you could be reaching is still just, in the end,13 percent.
