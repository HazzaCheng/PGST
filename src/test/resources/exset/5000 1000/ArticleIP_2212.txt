                                 Then and Now                           Then andNow                        JacobWeisberg's "Strange Bedfellow" column this week comes to the defense ofSeymour Hersh's new book on JFK, which is surfing a tidal wave of derision tothe best-seller list. We hope Weisberg's revelation that the book is not asawful as people say it is won't hurt its sales too much. Meanwhile, thereminder of how much fun Kennedy had in the White House raises once again thequestion: Could a president get away with it today? And the even moreintriguing question: OK, how? Fortunately, those vital questions were answeredby                   Slate               's David Plotz last year in his definitive study"Could Clinton Cheat? The logistics of presidential adultery." As far as weknow, the president has not taken advantage of Plotz's advice during the pastyear.                           HeadsUp                        For the past couple of weekswe have been posting quietly, in primitive form, a new                   Slate               feature that emerges fully this week. Called "PunditCentral," it is, to start, a summary and analysis--posted Mondaymorning--of who said what on the weekend political talk shows and how the ballwas moved as a result on various issues. It will also treat the print pundits,though less comprehensively. Like our other Briefing features, Pundit Centralcan be used either as a guide for what to read and watch or as an efficient(and, we hope, entertaining) substitute for reading and watching.            In case Pundit Central whetsyour appetite instead of sating it, the page includes an extensive set of linksto Web sites where the pundits and panjandrums can be found in their fullglory. Come to Pundit Central, and you'll never want for an opinion again.You'll be able to mix 'n' match, say, David Broder from the WashingtonPost on the new Paris fashions, Maureen Dowd from the New York Timeson local traffic conditions, and Liz Smith of Newsday on the Thaicurrency crisis to create your own op-ed dream team. The page also includeslinks to talk-show transcripts and newspaper editorial pages.            But whatis the best collective noun for people who make their living spouting opinionsin one medium or another (or, as is increasingly the case, in all of them)?"Punditocracy," the term most often used, is clumsy. The "commentariat," a wordcoined in a Washington Post editorial a few years back, is much wittier.Pundit Central uses both. It attempts to avoid the stale dismissive clich"talking heads," but sometimes, in a hurry, does refer to the breed, withsimple dignity, as "the heads."                           HavingWritten                        Lastweek's "Readme," touting                   Slate               's "Hackathlon"--acontest among four journalists for the title (to be awarded by                  Slate                readers' vote) of world's biggest hack--credited GloriaSteinem with the remark "I don't like writing. I like having written." A readerwrote in to say the remark actually belongs to Gertrude Stein, which we wereprepared to believe until another reader sent indignant e-mail on behalf ofDorothy Parker, which seems even more plausible. No one so far has nominatedLillian Hellman or Anita Loos or Catherine the Great, but if anyone can supplyactual evidence of the woman (or man) who made this remark, we'd be grateful,and we'll let the rest of you know.
