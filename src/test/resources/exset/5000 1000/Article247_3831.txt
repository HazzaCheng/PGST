                                 The Quayling of Al Gore            If to "bork" means to tar someone as a politicalextremist, and to get a "lewinsky" means, well, you know, then to "quayle"someone means to make some personal limitation seem so overwhelminglyridiculous that the victim becomes a permanent national laughingstock. Thequestion of whether Dan Quayle was, in fact, significantly denser than a lot ofother politicians (I'd argue he was only somewhat denser) became irrelevant inthe face of an entertaining clich. Try as he might, Quayle couldn't get anyoneto take him seriously as a presidential candidate, because all that thenational press corps and the national joke-writing corps wanted from him wasmaterial that confirmed his dumbbell stereotype.            The same thing appears to be happening to Quayle'ssuccessor as vice president. In Al Gore's case, the drubbing is for a slightlymore vague constellation of qualities such as dullness, starchiness, aloofness,pomposity, condescension, privilege, and political klutziness. There's anelement of truth to these criticisms. But by becoming a shtick, the observationof these qualities threatens to obliterate not only Gore's correspondingvirtues but also any hope of his becoming president. Every minor misstep thatGore makes becomes grist for the Gore-abuse mill. And whatever Gore does to tryto correct these flaws, whether it's playing along by mocking himself or tryingto demonstrate his authenticity and ordinary-guy-ness, only digs the holedeeper. When Gore hires a bunch of inside-the-Beltway political hacks andpretends there's no contest for the nomination, he's a risible Washingtonstiff. When he upends his campaign, yanks off his necktie, and engages hisopponent, he's a risible Washington stiff trying to be what he's not. (For anargument that Gore's makeover may be taking, see William Saletan's "Frame Game.")            Here are a few examples of what Gore is up against,culled from The Hotline over the last few days.                           Jeff Greenfield of CNN: "There is that problem that Gorehas always had as a candidate, and so that when he doesn't wear a tie--and thismay be unfair, but I don't think so--you have the sense that somebody, someclothing-engineer-consultant, said, 'Al, you know, use--we need the softertones,' and then they take a focus group: 'You like the shirt buttoned or not?'" ( Imus , 10/14)               Howard Fineman of Newsweek :"He's sort of turning himself into a combination of Walter Mondale and DickGephardt, the lunch-bucket, street-corner Democrat--the guy who grew up onWisconsin Avenue." ( Hardball , 10/13)               R.W. Apple of the New YorkTimes : "Now, he says, he is trying to 'let it all hang out.' The veryphrase sounds unnatural coming from a man whose shoes are always polished,whose hair is always combed, whose shirts and suits are always crisply pressed.All? He doesn't even let his shirt-tail hang out." ( NewYork Times , 10/11)               Jay Leno of the Tonight Show :"The folks in Nashville are thrilled that Al Gore has moved his campaignheadquarters back there. ... Because with him there, that automaticallyqualifies them for disaster-relief funds. ... Now, did you see Gore yesterday?He asked people to join his new, this is what he called it, his new,'rip-tootin' campaign. ... If you believe he is going to win with that slogan,you're either ripped or you've been tootin'." (10/7)                        On the campaign trail, this mockery translates into adamned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't dynamic. Take Gore's endorsementyesterday by the AFL-CIO. Had Gore failed to secure this prize, the story wouldhave been played as "more woe for the troubled Gore campaign" (or possibly,"last straw for troubled Gore campaign"). Gaining the endorsement, however,merely made Gore into Walter Mondale II, a Democratic establishmentarian whoseability to lock up the party's offiical interest groups won't translate intorank-and-file enthusiasm. Here's how Peter Jennings played the AFL-CIOendorsement on ABC last night: "In Los Angeles, good news--mostly--for VicePresident Gore, depending on how the political media spin it, in part." Memo toPeter Jennings: You are the political media.            But there's a silver lining for Gore: If the publicreally demands candidates with a flair for schmoozing, smooth talk, and ersatzempathy, then "Clinton fatigue" must be something of a myth.
