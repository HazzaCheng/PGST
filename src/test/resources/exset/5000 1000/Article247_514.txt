                                 Nelvis Enters the Building            Kenneth Starr's latest moves lead at USA Today ,the Washington Post , and the New York Times .They are also the subject of a somewhat historic story at the Wall Street Journal . The Los AngelesTimes leads with the latest developments in the Iraq situation.                           USAT reports that on Wednesday Starr rejected a writtentestimony-for-immunity offer from Monica Lewinsky. Before a deal can bereached, the paper says, Starr wants Lewinsky to submit to questioning by hisinvestigators, who especially want to clarify whether or not there were anyattempts to cover up an affair with the president. Starr particularly wants tofind out more about what Lewinsky knows about the provenance of the "talkingpoints" memo that Linda Tripp apparently received from her. The WP leadalso says these are the main areas about which Starr wants more info.            The LAT front doesn't cover the latest Lewinsky blips, but the otherdailies are all over the parade of witnesses to Starr's Washington, D.C. grandjury. (The WP points out that Starr's rejection of Lewinsky's offer mayreflect his confidence in what he's getting from these witnesses.) Recenttestifiers include a Clinton friend who serves as his personal assistant, andthe chief steward at the White House, Bayani Nelvis.            Last night's early editions of the on-line version of the WSJ broke the news thatNelvis told the grand jury he'd seen President Clinton and Lewinsky alonetogether in a study adjacent to the Oval Office. After the story went on-line,it was picked up by at least two TV networks and then denied by Nelvis'attorney. The Journal also reports that Nelvis says that he told SecretService personnel that he'd found and disposed of tissues with lipstick andother stains on them following a meeting between Clinton and Lewinsky. Thepaper says Nelvis, on the White House staff for more than 15 years, relatedthis because he was personally offended.            The WSJ also reports that in their grand jury appearances, GeorgeStephanopoulos and Clinton personal secretary Betty Currie confirmed thatNelvis did have the access he claimed.            The Journal 's story represents a first because it was released on thepaper's web site, rather than being held for the hard-copy edition, and thusrepresents an occurrence you'll be seeing again: newspapers and magazines usingtheir electronic versions to break and refine stories round-the-clock every bitas quickly as CNN. The WP 's Howard Kurtz writes that the WSJdidn't wait for the morning paper because it was hearing footsteps from atleast one other news organization.            The NYT lead says Starr has rejected a White Houserequest that the questioning of senior Clinton aides be restricted. And inresponse, says the paper, the administration is prepared to invoke the sweepingprotection known as executive privilege as early as Thursday, when JohnPodesta, a deputy White House chief of staff, goes before the grand jury.            The LAT reports that Boris Yeltsin's warning that U.S. actionsagainst Saddam "could lead to a World War" took the White House by surprise.(This remark is also carried inside the WP and NYT .) TheLAT says Yeltsin's remark reflects the growing global anxiety about theseeming inevitability of a U.S. attack. William Safire is less charitable,condemning Yeltsin harshly and painting his foreign minister Primakov as aformer spymaster and one-time ally of Hussein.            The NYT front reports that a split has emerged in Washingtonregarding any possible military response. Top Republicans are calling for theremoval of Saddam, while the administration is trying to suppressexpectations.            The USAT front states that Italy's defense minister is demandingcriminal prosecution for an American Marine pilot whose plane sliced through aski gondola's cable Tuesday, killing all 20 passengers. The NYT , in itsfront-page coverage, says the plane was flying far lower than the rules fortraining missions allow.            With crime down and the economy up, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani isfinally able to turn to the really big issues--like keeping the original Winnie-the-Pooh doll in a Manhattan museum against theclaims of a member of the British Parliament that it belongs back in England.Hizzoner is even planning a trip to the museum to, in the words of a likewiseunderworked spokeswoman, "reassure the bear that he is safe on Americansoil."
