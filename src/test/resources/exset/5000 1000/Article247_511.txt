                                 Iraq and Roll?                           USAToday leads with the diplomatic efforts being undertaken to avoid U.S.military action against Iraq. The Los AngelesTimes lead describes those efforts too, but emphasizes the nature ofthe likely U.S. military response. The Washington Post leads with Madeleine Albright's frustrationwith the Israeli-Palestinian impasse. And the New York Timesgoes with the Clinton budget strategy.                           USAT reports that besides Albright's whirlwind tour of the MiddleEast, Iraq-related diplomacy is also being undertaken by Russia and France.Also, the U.N.'s Kofi Annan has proposed loosening the strictures governingIraq's oil sales as an incentive for Iraqi cooperation with U.N. inspectors andAlbright said she supports that. Albright was in Kuwait yesterday and is boundfor Saudi Arabia today. An AP dispatch quoted in both USAT and the WSJstates that the Saudis will not allow any Iraq strikes to originate from theircountry.                           USAT also says Newt Gingrich has signaled strong support for actionagainst Saddam, while his colleague Richard Armey has stressed the need forprior Congressional review of any attack plan.            The LAT lead headline is quite clear: "U.S. Would Hit Iraq HardDespite the Likely Costs." But the text is anything but. High up, the reader istold only that the U.S. game plan calls for taking "substantial militaryaction," which aims to "destroy key military props supporting Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein and affirm principles for the post-Cold War world." Readingfurther on the front page does reveal the possibility of an expanded no-flyzone, but mainly yields the "information" that after the action, the U.S. will"put in place a post-strike program that would strengthen and potentiallybroaden the U.N. mandate inside Iraq," which the reader "learns," will"reconstitute" the U.N. weapons inspection team to "make it more effective asit searches for weapons."            A nationwide poll that the LAT plays big both in an off-leadstory and a big top-of-the-page graphic suggests that by a large marginAmericans support the use of force against Iraq and additionally think thepurpose of an airstrike should be to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Mostrespondents also dismiss the suggestion that President Clinton is preparing amove against Iraq as a means of distracting attention from his ownproblems.            The WP lead reports that in separate meetings Secretary of StateAlbright privately scolded Israel and Palestinian leaders, telling them she is"sick and tired of hearing you give me a pile full of complaints about theother guy." The Post credits this quotation to "a senior U.S. officialwith direct knowledge of the conversations." The NYT in its Albrightstory sources the comment the same way. (Gee, given that the scoldings wereprivate, and that the knowledge was direct, who could that be?)            The WP , like USAT , also mentions Albright's pledge to Israelof an "iron-clad commitment" to defend Israel in case it is attacked by Iraq,but doesn't include Netanyahu's response, reported by USAT , that unlikein 1991 during the Gulf War, Israel will now feel free to defend itself. TheNYT front-page Albright piece adds a further wrinkle, noting thatAlbright responded, "It is up to each country to determine its own way todefend itself."            The NYT lead points out that the main new social programs of theClinton budget--such as child-care programs and new teacher hiring--are linkedto congressional approval of the national tobacco settlement. And if Congressfails to enact the tobacco deal thereby killing these programs, says the paper,Democrats come away with a potent political issue: the Republicans favored thetobacco industry over children and health. The Wall Street Journal 's Alan Murray thinks there will be somesort of tobacco legislation this year. Congress, he says, is moving towardsenacting the parts of the settlement the tobacco companies don't like whiledenying them the part they want--immunity from future lawsuits.            The WSJ reports that the GDP jumped 4.3 percent for the last quarterof 1997 and that for all of 1997, the economy grew 3.8 percent, the best ratein ten years.            The most newsy development in what "Today's Papers" had decided to call theWhitefluid scandal is that yesterday, as reported in the WP , MonicaLewinsky's lawyer revealed on one of his five (!) chat show appearances thatit's possible his client, who owns a share of a Australian condo, wastape-recorded offering it to Linda Tripp in return for Tripp denying knowingabout Lewinsky's claim that she had a sexual relationship with PresidentClinton.
