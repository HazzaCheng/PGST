                                 Hip Journalism            The Dow's bounce back above 8000 leads at USA Today . Atthe Washington Post , it's the global warming summit inKyoto. The New York Timesgoes with the Federal Trade Commission's 4-0 decision to abandon a plan toweaken the meaning of the "Made in USA" label. And the Los AngelesTimes leads with California's endorsement of throwback math standardsfor public school students that emphasize--get this--correct answers and lotsof practice and discourage reliance on calculators.            The NYT lead reports that the FTC had been considering dropping thethreshold for "Made in USA" from the current interpretation of 98 percent of anitem's value down to as low as 75 percent. Big businesses that import a lot ofcomponents, explains the paper, would have benefited at the expense of smallercompanies that do not. (The automobile, textile, wool and fur industries aresubject to separate requirements and are not covered by the decision.) TheTimes says the FTC switch is, like the stalling of fast track, a bigvictory for, and the result of political pressure from, organized labor. TheWall Street Journal , which flags the story in itsfront-page news box, explains that companies can still continue to makequalified U.S.-origin claims, such as "80% Made in USA." (Question for WilliamSafire: Isn't "80% Made in USA" like "80% Born in USA"? Either it's made hereor not, right?)            The headline writers at the WP couldn't have been too disappointedabout the dissension in Kyoto. This way, they got to write "U.S. Greeted Coollyat Climate Summit." The paper reports that at the opening session, the U.S.delegate reiterated the Clinton administration's position of getting back to1990 greenhouse gas levels by 2010 and called the more stringent proposalsfavored by European countries unrealistic or ineffective. In part as a responseto worldwide criticism of this position, says the Post , PresidentClinton announced, after months of refusing to have a high-level presence atthe meetings, that he is sending Al Gore to Kyoto to help forge aninternational greenhouse gas agreement. The thumbnail explanation of globalwarming the Post provides in its lead coverage is odd: the onlydangerous effect of warming it mentions by name is the possible spread ofmalaria to colder climates, nothing about another Ice Age.            On its front above the fold, the LAT reports that a survey of 347cities by the U.S. Conference of Mayors indicates that the recent increasedimposition of anti-truancy and juvenile curfew statutes correlates with a dropin the juvenile crime rate. The story goes on to mention that the Los AngelesPolice Department credits L.A.'s 1996 anti-truancy law with a 20 to 45 percentdrop in daytime burglaries, shoplifting and car break-ins (unfortunately, noword from the LAT about why the wide stat parameters here).            The above story sits without comment right next to one slugged "StudentOpens Fire on Prayer Group, Kills 2."            But at least the LAT puts that school shooting on the front page. (Asdoes USAT . The NYT front has a picture only.) The WP doesnot--but it does run a column one top front story, accompanied by not one, butthree pictures, about the Washington Redskins quarterback breaking his hip.(Breaking news?)            James Glassman's WP column quotes this take from computer scientistDavid Gelertner on the government's goal of wiring the nation's schoolrooms tothe Internet: "Children need Internet access the way they need subsidized busservice to the nearest mall."                           News you can lose . The WP runs the following correction: "ASunday Arts story incorrectly reported that Pietro di Cristoforo di PietroVannucci, the Renaissance painter known as Perugino ("the one from Perugia"),was born in Perugia. He was born 27 miles away in Castello della Pieve, nowcalled Citta della Pieve, a town that was under the suzerainty of Perugia."
