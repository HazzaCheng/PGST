                                 &quot;Slobba Sinks to a New Evil&quot;            The war in Yugoslaviacontinued to eclipse all other news across Europe Wednesday, with theGuardian of London leading its front page: "Day 21: morebombs, more death, more despair." The paper said the war "showed ominous signsof widening" with the Serb incursion into Albania Tuesday. In the Britishtabloids, though, the dominant war issue was rape. "The Rape Factory" was themain front-page headline in the Sun , which added the rider, "Slobbasinks to a new evil." "The rape camps" was a headline in the DailyMail .            The reports were basedon a statement Tuesday by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook that youngethnic Albanian women are being herded into an army camp in Kosovo andsubjected to systematic rape by Serbian security forces. In the LondonEvening Standard , conservative historian Andrew Robertswarned against the demonization of Slobodan Milosevic, because it wouldincrease his support among the Serbs. He is, of course, "a vicious, ruthlesstyrant, but so are many people in the world whom Nato has chosen not to bomb.To equate him with Hitler, who really did threaten the West in a way Milosevicnever could, can only flatter and strengthen him."            The Daily Express of London splashed an exclusive report on its front page that the British ConservativeParty had received "substantial" donations in the 1997 election from aSerbian-owned company with close links to the Milosevic regime. Two payments ofabout $14,500 each were made by Metalchem International, "a British-registeredmetal trading company which was under United Nations sanctions and remains on aU.S. blacklist because of its financial ties with Serbia." In an editorial, theExpress said the Conservative leadership should "immediately and withoutquestion repay to Metalchem or to the Serbian government the money theygave."            In other British presseditorials Wednesday, the conservative Daily Mail said that "publicopinion is swinging in favor of an invasion" and that "the launch of a groundoffensive seems likelier every day"; the Times "that it may takeground troops, backed by massive air power, to drive them [the Serbian forces]out of Kosovo"; the Daily Telegraph that Bill Clinton and Tony Blair should rapidlysanction "the Nato ground offensive that would be required to bring Serbia toheel"; and the Guardian that the West was sending a signal to Belgrade"that ground action is becoming an available option for Nato, should the aircampaign bring no acceptable result, but that an opportunity remains forsettlement before a decision on ground action is made." The Financial Times , on the otherhand, devoted an editorial to the argument that "the US should engage Russiamore. That means accepting more than a token Russian presence in theinternational force that may accompany the refugees back to Kosovo. Failure todo this risks turning a split over Yugoslavia into another cold war."            Meanwhile, a report in the Independent said that the United States might offer IraqiKurds full military protection against President Saddam Hussein if they allowedthe Iraqi opposition to base itself in the area they control. The story quotedHoshyar Zibari, a leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which controlswestern Kurdistan, as saying, "We would need to have a no-fly, no-drive zoneprotecting our cities from Iraqi government retaliation if we were toco-operate with the Iraqi opposition." U.S. officials are "seriouslyconsidering" the matter, he claimed.            In Iceland, the daily Morgunbladid reportedthat a plan to sail an Icelandic Viking ship to North America as part of nextyear's millennium celebrations is in jeopardy because lack of funding hasdelayed the preparations. The original plan was for a crew of nine or 10 peopleto take the Vlkingur , a replica of a Viking vessel, to Newfoundland,Canada, and to New York "to commemorate the 1,000 th anniversary ofLeifur Eirksson's discovery of North America." the paper said. But now, if thevoyage goes ahead at all, the ship will sail only to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Afinal decision will be made this week.            The Irish Times of Dublin carried a front-page picture caption,"The Lord God omnipotent raineth on choir in Fishamble Street." This was abovea picture of members of Our Lady's Choral Society in pink raincoats andwaterproof hats trying to sing Handel's Messiah outdoors in a hailshower. The first performance of the Messiah was held in FishambleStreet in 1742.
