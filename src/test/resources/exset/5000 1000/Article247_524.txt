                                 America Discovers Columbus            The LosAngeles Times , Washington Post , and New York Timesall lead with the raucous reception the top Clinton foreign policy figures weresurprised to receive when they appeared at a town-hall-style discussion of Iraqin Columbus, Ohio. USA Today , which runs Columbus as its off-lead, goes withKen Starr's questioning of President Clinton's key advisor, Bruce Lindsey.USAT says Lindsey's five-hour grand jury appearance Wednesday includedtestimony about past telephone conversations with Linda Tripp. The questioningapparently set off a special conference with a judge about whether or not aideslike Lindsey are protected by executive privilege, although USAT saysthat the White House has not invoked it.            The in-studio Columbus audience of about 6,000 served up what the LATcalls a "raucous, emotional debate that showed a nation far from convinced ofthe administration's course in the Persian Gulf." Or as the WP puts it,the Clinton team of William Cohen, Madeleine Albright, and Sandy Berger camefor a seminar, but "ran into a rumble." The Post reports that duringcommercial breaks, while the startled Clintonites held whispered conferences,aides fanned out into the noisy parts of the arena to calm those (numberingabout 200, guesses the Times ) chanting "We don't want your racist war."Some of the most aggressive hecklers were carried outside.            The Post serves up an acute description of what transpired: theadministration reps found themselves caught between opposing passions (aboutbeing two tough on Iraq, about not being tough enough) armed only with alargely passionless argument. The paper notes a simple example of thepredicament: Cohen waved about a photo of a mother and infant killed by Iraqichemical warfare while arguing against deposing or killing Hussein.            The juxtaposition on the Post top-front is striking: "Top Aidesshouted down at 'Town Meeting' on Iraq" cheek-by-jowl with "The Guys arePumped," over a story about the stealth fighter crews massing in Kuwait.            The pieces make it clear that the ordinary folks in the auditorium werehighly attuned to an issue that has gotten hardly any attention in the press:consistency. In other words, why should we punish Hussein and support andreward say, Indonesia, which has been slaughtering people in East Timor?            But the coverage barely notices that the Columbus protest suggests somethingsquishy or downright wrong in all those polls showing extensive public supportfor President Clinton's stance. (And probably puts the kibosh on that plannedtown hall meeting on presidential dating.)            The WP front reports that a rising number of women poor enough to beon Medicaid would like to be sterilized, but because of their own paperworkerrors and stiff bureaucratic requirements, they aren't and keep having kids.An additional factor is that the doctors who deliver these babies are scared ofbeing sued by women still in their child-bearing years. Also, Medicaid rulesprohibit the sterilization of a woman under 21 no matter how many children shehas.            The WP notes a media consequence of l'affaire Lewinsky: a rebound forconservatively oriented talk radio. This doesn't just mean, notes thePost , better numbers for Rush and the G-man, but also things like Monicalook-alike contests and two stations offering million dollar prizes to anywoman who can prove she slept with the president.            Both the Wall Street Journal and the NYT report that most ofthe nation's law schools attacked the upcoming U.S. News and WorldReport rankings (due out Friday). The schools hired a consultant to rebutthe listings and sent out a letter debunking them to 93,000 current law-schoolapplicants.            Opponents of affirmative action often observe that it doesn't exist inperformance-based arenas like show business. But a small item in the WP 's TV column makes you wondereven about that: It seems that UPN has ordered up a full season of episodes forthe virtually all-black "Moesha," which as of last Sunday, the paper reports,ranked 124th among the 139 series on the air.
