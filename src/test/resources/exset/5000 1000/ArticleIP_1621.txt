                                 Mom for Governor                           Cool Mom , producedby Murphy, Pintak, Gautier, Hudome Agency Inc. for Whitman for Governor.                           Cool                Mom givesus the softer side of New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, drawing viewerattention away from polls (three in just the last week) that show her in a deadheat with Democratic challenger Jim McGreevey. Besides giving New Jersey votersa much-needed break from Whitman's attacks on her opponent and his "high-taxphilosophy," it is also a well-calculated response to McGreevey'sattacks on Whitman as clueless snob and insensitive patrician. Produced by Republicanmedia adviser Mike Murphy, this spot disdains contentious facts and boringstats in favor of fuzz. It focuses on Whitman as Mom--a cool one, if herkids, Taylor and Kate, are to be believed--and in so doing recalls a radio adthat Whitman used to good effect when trying to revive a sagging campaign in1993.            That ad had Kate talking ofher mother as a role model. This one has both kids going the same route. Notonly does Mom get the credit for instilling in him basic values--integrity andresponsibility and honesty; the importance of keeping one's promises--but shealso gets extra points for having taught by example. As important, perhaps, isthat she has been a caring, fun companion, the glue that keeps the family"tight-knit."            The opening frames show theWhitmans on a lush, picket-fenced green, making no apologies for what isobviously a life of privilege. A football is tossed--and almost missed--amidmuch laughter and camaraderie, reprising what is arguably one of the mostmemorable images of modern politics, that of the Kennedys playing touchfootball at Hyannisport. No matter that some folks have a bigger lawn, theseimages are meant to say: What matters is heart, the desire to do good. The ideathat wealth is venial if pressed into public service is a harder sell for aRepublican than it is for a Democrat (even FDR was lambasted as being a traitorto his class, remember?). But Whitman's intentions, insists Cool Mom ,are unimpeachable and always have been, her commitment to her various rolesabsolute ("she has that ability to go home and forget about all the politicalstuff and be a ... mom").            The testimonials from theseclean-cut, well-adjusted kids (to say nothing of the family resemblance) make aclear play for the soccer-mom vote--a segment that attack ads have been knownto alienate. That aside, Whitman's opponents have sought, in recent weeks, toundermine her popularity among female voters by attacking her handling ofsexual-harassment allegations against two Republican officials. Cool Momwould regain that ground--and wreak its own subtle havoc (McGreevey is goingthrough a divorce, and his daughter, 4-year-old Morag, lives in Canada with hermother).            Whitman's allegedlysuccessful separation of personal from political does not, however, extend tothis ad. Images of the governor at work--signing bills, making speeches--splicea story that is told by her children. Taylor, speaking to camera, lauds "whatshe's done for the state," as a shot of Whitman amid cheering supporters (oneprominently uniformed) reminds voters that it is she who deserves credit forthe decrease in crime. And she has "stuck with what she said she was going todo" (there's no denying that she cut income taxes--so what if property taxesthen went up?).            The images flow thick:Whitman, baseball cap and all, mingling easily at what looks like atransportation event ("what she does, she does to help New Jersey"); Whitmanbehind a sign that trumpets her "Work First" program, then a shot of herhugging a politically correct mix of kids ("she loves this state"). As Katepoints out, the governor "wants to do the best that she can" for her voters.Cool Mom invites its viewers to look beyond an administration'sshortfalls to the character--or, at least, the intentions--of the woman at itshelm. Less obviously clever than McGreevey's caricature of Whitman, the spotmakes artful use of the personal to validate the political. Whether it cantrump an opponent's attacks and ease an electorate's frustrations remains, ofcourse, to be seen.                           --RobertShrum
