                                 Batouti Bashing            The New York Timesleads with an agreement between the White House and Congress on a.38-percent across-the-board spending cut, a story fronted by the Washington Post andreefered by the LosAngeles Times and USA Today . The Wall Street Journal tops its "Worldwide" box with the arrestsof hundreds of alleged debtors in Pakistan by the new military junta, a storyfronted by no other paper. The Post and USAT lead with theEgyptAir 990 investigation, a story fronted by the NYT andLAT . The LAT leads with a decision by the United States,Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia to build a pipeline from the landlocked CaspianBasin states to a port in Turkey. Russia had been lobbying to have the pipelinecross Chechnya, and the West's demurral may cause friction at a meeting todaybetween President Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. The LAT story says thepipeline will "tap rich oil fields in Central Asia," but a Journalarticle on the deal says that no oil has yet been found; the pipeline is moreabout political alliances than oil.            The Journal reports that the National Transportation Safety Boardwill give Egyptian officials several days to convince it that the FBI shouldnot take over the EgyptAir 990 investigation. Although not much new evidencesurrounding the crash has come to light since yesterday, USAT , theNYT , the LAT , and the Post run dispatches from Cairoquoting relatives of the plane's suspected saboteur, co-pilot Gamil al-Batouti( NYT spelling). (All five papers continue to spell the namedifferently; see yesterday's "TP.") The Islamical-Batouti was faithful enough not to condone suicide, the relatives argue, butnot zealous enough to believe in extreme political causes. And while he hadnever been promoted to captain, as he had wanted, he was still quitewealthy--so much so that he held no life insurance.            The NYT chronicles Al Gore's journalism career. After brief stintsas a copy boy for the NYT in college and as an Army reporter inVietnam, Gore took a job at the the Tennessean --which was then apopular stop-off for the idealistic sons of political figures (the sons ofRobert Kennedy, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and John Sirica had worked there). ButGore surprised the paper's staff of working-class scribblers by staying therefor five years. His biggest story involved teaming up with the local D.A. tolure a councilman into taking a $300 bribe. The councilman was defeated at thepolls as a result, but he was acquitted in court. The acquittal disillusionedthe future vice president with the power of the pen, and he decided to changecareers. He entered law school and shortly thereafter ran for Congress when aseat opened up. Today the councilman--who has since been re-elected--has a Gore2000 sign in his window. "His qualifications [for the presidency] outweighanything that happened between us," he says.            The LAT highlights some unlikely beneficiaries of the Internet: thehomeless. In Los Angeles, about a half-dozen homeless shelters have computerlabs, which help residents learn everything from remedial math to job-searchingtechniques. Free e-mail access has allowed the homeless to receive messages andinteract with potential employers in ways they could not before. But sincecomputer time in shelters in highly structured, most of the truly dedicatedhomeless techies--the entrepreneurs--use the public library, where time isvirtually unlimited (and where, in large cities, up to 75 percent of users arehomeless). The homeless, it turns out, make money on the Web in much the sameway they do on the street--by finding value in things discarded by others. Onehomeless man set up a site to sell bicycle parts that he bought cheap from a shop thatwent out of business. Another made a few thousand dollars by selling obscurevideos; he simply found the videos elsewhere on the Web and sold them at amarkup. One man began by charging others $5 to teach them how to acquire freee-mail accounts. Now he runs a Drudge-like tech industry gossip site, which has a mailing listof 2,700. On the Web, "it doesn't show if you haven't showered for three days,"says a former homeless woman who now runs a Seattle writing workshop.                           USAT reports that Britain's busiest freeway, the M6, was terrorizedby a carload of five Austin Powers look-alikes wielding toy guns. Thevelvet-clad pranksters were caught by a roadblock and given a warning bypolice.
