Monday's Question(No. 215)--"Here's the Pitch":                                                         Fill in the blank. After creating the highest-rated movie evermade for Showtime, Warren Weideman is about to make four sequels, but theproject was a tough sale. "Most producers' eyes would glaze over as soon as Isaid the words, '____________.' "                                       "Highest-rated movie ever made for Showtime."-- Daniel Radosh ( BruceBrown and Bruce Oberg had similar answers.)            "Emmanuelle, but with clothes."-- Ananda "Getcher Cheap Astroturf Here"Gupta                        "Baruch ataw adonay ..."-- Larry Amaros                        "Unioncrew."--Stephen Frick                        "My twokittens and my new laser pointer."-- Andrew Reynolds                        Clickfor more answers.                           Randy'sWrap-Up                        What I hadn't realizedwhen I posted this question was that two different types of responses werepossible--those that mock the idiocy of Warren Weideman for proposing trulystupid movies, frequently involving an abstruse philosopher, and those thatmock Showtime for making truly stupid movies, frequently involvingShannon Tweed with her shirt off. These are both worthy goals, and that's whatI admire about News Quiz participants: that the Weideman mockers and theShowtime mockers can respect each other and work together to mock variousmembers of the Bush family, the anti-missile system, and maybe some kind ofmonkey--that's why the anti-missile system doesn't work, see, because of hiscrazy antics, and then Gov. Bush has him executed, and all of America and theLockheed board of directors can sleep peacefully! Tonight on Showtime: ShannonTweed in Fry His Monkey Ass, Governor Hero . Oh, like you wouldn'twatch.                           First-ClassAnswer                        "Most producers' eyes would glaze over as soon as Isaid the words 'post office .' "            The postal service did not directly finance TheInspectors , starring Louis Gossett Jr. as a two-fisted postal inspector,but it did spend millions promoting it--printing 5,000 commemorative envelopes,hanging movie posters in 40,000 post offices, and putting Gossett's voice onits phone system so you hear a movie promo when you're on hold.            The idea for the movie emerged when the postalservice hired Weideman, an ad man who was very big in product placement, toimprove its image.            While ludicrous on theface of it, there have been less likely government heroes. Richard Widmarkplayed a two-fisted health inspector tracking down a pneumonic plague carrierin the 1950 Panic in the Streets , directed by the odious but talentedElia Kazan; it won an Oscar for best story. And I believe Gene Hackman onceplayed an FBI agent who supported the civil rights movement and battled robotdogs on Neptune.                           Silver LiningExtra                        Yesterday in New Mexico, for the sixth time in sixtests, an anti-missile missile missed its target. But that's really a goodthing, according to both the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin, which built thesystem.                           "It was a very close miss."-- Jennifer Caniff, Pentagonspokeswoman                              "We came very close to hitting this target ... and we're very encouraged bythat."-- Thomas Corcoran, president and CEO of Lockheed Martin                              "Much of the operation was as it should be."-- Thomas Corcoran                              "Our technicians were courteous and neatly dressed."-- Thomas Corcoran,or perhaps that was me                              "And lunch. That went well, especially those spicy shrimp, mmmmmm."-- Thomas Corcoran, or was that me too?                              "Oh, right, so you're so perfect, Mr. Perfect,Mr. Goddamned Big Nose Perfect Sissy Boy Stupid!"-- Thomas Corcoran; oops, meagain                                                      CommonDenominator                        Some Unlikely Old Bore in Love.
