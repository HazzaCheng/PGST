                                 Indian Gambling            Gambling as an enterpriseamong American Indian tribes has exploded in recent years. The first operationstarted in 1979. Today, 280 operations are conducted by 186 gambling tribesacross 28 states; the 1996 take is estimated at $6 billion. Indian tribes arenow locked in competition: Three Wisconsin tribes have filed a suit claimingthey were denied a casino license in 1995 because wealthier tribes beat them toDemocratic campaign coffers. It appears likely that an independent counsel willbe appointed to investigate Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's handling of theaffair. What is the legal basis for gambling on Indian reservations? Whataccounts for the explosion in the number and size of such operations? Whocontrols the gambling spigot: the tribes, the states within whose boundariesthe reservations lie, or the federal government?                           Theconcept of tribal sovereignty. The " cases" of the 1830s framedtribe-state-union relations thus: The tribes were neither foreign nor subjectnations; they were "domestic dependent nations," "wards" to the union's"guardian." Since the reservations were federal protectorates, state law had noforce on their territory.                           Exceptions to the rule. Tribal immunityfrom state law is not absolute. Tribes have, on occasion, opted for a blurringof boundaries (asking that state cops patrol reservation land, for example).And several court decisions since Cherokee have authorized exceptions tothe state-exclusion principle. A state may, for example, make enforceable lawsgoverning tribes if Congress delegates authority to that state.            Congresshas used its delegation power to transfer its authority to states on severaloccasions. For example, Public Law 280 (1953) gave several states onreservations. Even without the specific delegation of authority, state law maystill be considered valid if it doesn't flout federal goals. Click for anexample.                           Limits on state control. Gambling didnot become an issue until 1979, when the Seminole tribe of Florida identifiedbingo as a means of alleviating poverty on the reservation. The tribe'sdecision put it in direct conflict with Florida's rather restrictive bingostatute. Crying PL 280, Florida went to court--and the court ruled in favor ofthe tribe. Its reasoning: Bingo was not universally prohibited in Florida;nonprofit organizations were exempt. Therefore, the state had no right toregulate bingo on the Seminole reservation.            TheSeminole victory was the first in a series, and Indian gambling thrived overthe next several years.                           Enter Congress. The Indian GamingRegulatory Act (1988) sought to set regulatory standards and arbitrateoutstanding tribe-state conflicts. IGRA confirmed the tribes' "exclusive" rightto regulate reservation gambling as long as the gambling activity in questiondid not violate federal or state law.            The actalso divided Indian gambling into three classes. Of these, tribes were givencontrol of the first two (traditional/ceremonial games, bingo, and some cardgames). But Class III operations--casinos and the like--required that the tribeenter an agreement, or "compact," with the state.            IGRA obliged the state to enter negotiations ingood faith, failing which a tribe could sue in federal court. But when theSeminoles, victorious in 1979, sued Florida after being denied compactnegotiations in 1996, they lost.            Predictably, IGRA has comeunder fire from all directions. Incensed tribes have pointed out that thecourt's ruling stripped them of their safety net, making their sovereigntymoot. The Department of the Interior is exploring alternative procedures thatwould let tribes negotiate compacts directly with the secretary, cutting thestates out of the equation. This July, Sen. John McCain introduced the IndianGaming Regulatory Act Amendments Act of 1997 in the Senate, seeking, amongother things, to establish an independent U.S. agency that would set minimumfederal regulatory standards for reservation gambling.            Meanwhile, a few tribes keepthe bulk of the gambling prize: The General Accounting Office reports that ofthe 126 tribes operating gambling facilities as of Dec. 31, 1996, eightaccounted for 40 percent of total revenues. Moreover, Tribal AllocationPriority funds, as federal payments to tribal governments are known, aredivvied up based on tribe size and population density rather than income,meaning that tribes with big gambling incomes often get federal subsidies asbig as those with none.
