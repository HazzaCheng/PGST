                                 Case: Dissed Miss            The surprising dismissal of Paula Jones' lawsuit leads all around, with theLosAngeles Times and Washington Post going with full banner headlines. Federaljudge Susan Webber Wright ruled that although Bill Clinton's conduct may havebeen "boorish and offensive," it was brief, and isolated and didn't result inphysical harm. Therefore, it wasn't, she concluded, under even the mostcharitable reading of the record, a sexual assault or workplace harassment. TheNew York Timesnotes that Wright gave no credit to Jones' claim of suffering "sexual aversion"as a result of her run-in with Clinton. The papers all note that the judgedismissed as irrelevant in a few sentences all the Jones allegations of aClinton pattern of extramarital sex. Jones' lawyers intend to appeal. Ken Starrresponded to the news by promising to soldier on. The ruling, he tells USA Today ,"has no effect on our authority."            The WP makes the point that this is not obvious, observing that anyperjury or obstruction of justice charges against Clinton would be based on hisconduct in a now-dead case.            The reaction of the other principals is widely reported: Clinton asked ifthe unexpected good news was an April Fools' joke. Jones got the news on hercar phone and pulled over and cried. The Post says officials at theWhite House and with the president in Africa maintained a "consciously subduedtone," but the LAT reports staff cheers and laughter, and the NYTfinds President Clinton walking around his Dakar, Senegal hotel suite with acigar in his mouth and a drum in his hands (to be replaced moments later with aguitar.)            The political impact is also generally viewed as pro-Clinton. HouseRepublicans, says the LAT , may now be wary of moving aggressivelyagainst Clinton. The NYT says it even stronger: "It is now politically inconceivable that Congress will considerimpeachment."            But, adds the NYT , despite the trial outcome, "the president and thepresidency appear to have been diminished in important and lasting ways." Afront-page WP piece says the Jones lawsuit "has had an indelible impacton the American political system and on other institutions in American life."And the LAT lead editorial sees the development as a "bittersweetvictory for the president." Perhaps, the editorial continues, "it is possibleto envision a time when Social Security reform and other urgent issues mightcapture the attention of the nation and be at the top of the congressionalagenda. When the debate over health care returns to the spotlight. When thedetails of the tobacco settlement become a matter of wide public discussion.But...the world's suspicions about his truthfulness in many things will dog hisplace in history." The scandal, says the LAT has made the president seem"coated in slime."            A Wall Street Journal front-page feature reports thatthe rich have, somewhat surprisingly, not been able to shelter their incomefrom the higher taxes ushered in by George Bush (1990) and Bill Clinton (1993).Indeed, says the Journal , upper income tax revenues are a big reason thefederal deficit has vanished. Nowadays the top 5 percent of American familiesin earnings are paying about 32 percent of their income in taxes, compared toabout 26.7 percent ten years ago.            A piece inside the WP (about an article coming out today in thescientific journal Nature ) reports that a New York scientist, StuartNewman, has applied for a patent for a way of mixing human embryo cellswith those from a monkey, ape or other animal. His goal: to set off adebate about the morality of patenting life forms, which Newman is opposed to.Currently, explains the Post , patents are not allowed on human beings(based on the 13th Amendment's proscription of slavery), but the issue ofhybrids is unsettled, because patent law has not addressed "how human" ananimal would have to be before it fell under the ban.
