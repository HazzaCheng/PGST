                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        Alan Greenspan appeared Wednesday in front of the Senate committee that'svoting on his renomination as Fed chair, and he turned in a bravuraperformance. Of course, it's probably easier to turn in bravura performanceswhen you know that everyone in the room listening to you believes that you area true Zen master. Nonetheless, Greenspan was surprisingly interesting onsubjects like European hostility to genetically modified food and thepersistent anxiety that many American workers feel in the face of technologicalchange. He also remained definitively non-committal on the question of where,exactly, we are on the curve of that technological change, keeping open thepossibility that there may still be many years ahead of rapid economic growthpropelled by rapid improvements in productivity.            Of course, as always when Greenspan appears before Congress, it was fun towatch the senators try to make their own dubious economic views appear to beharmonious with the Fed chair's. But Greenspan's labyrinthine speaking styleserves him well in those situations. He can begin with "Well, yes, Senator" andend with an effective "so, actually, no," without ever making anyone look bad.Which is, perhaps, one definition of a Zen master.            1. "Philip Morris announced that in the last quarter, its earnings missedestimates and its revenue grew just 2 percent . So you have a company thatwill have to pay the government billions for the foreseeable future, thatgets dragged into court (and sometimes loses) every week , and that keepsseeing the price of its key product rise because of taxes, and that'smaking less money than expected. It's all The Insider 's fault, nodoubt."            2. "Business Week reported that among the myriad class-actionlawsuits filed against Microsoft in the wake of Judge Jackson's finding isa brief claiming that Microsoft's principal place of business is Texas andanother describing Microsoft as a supplier of 'generic drugs.' Thatbrief adds that the term API stands for 'active pharmaceutical ingredient.' (Itdoesn't.) I'm waiting for the brief accusing Microsoft of running Area 51 andbeing responsible for the Roswell Incident. In that brief, API will presumablystand for 'alien probe investigation.'"            3. "Before entering into negotiations for a possible three-way deal withWarner-Lambert and American Home Products , Procter & Gamblereportedly made an unsolicited bid for razor giant Gillette. An article inTheStreet.com this week said that 'the French company' had rebuffedP&G . Well, we always thought that Boston was the Paris ofMassachusetts. But who knew that it was actually the Paris of France?"            4. "The best ad for financial advice right now is one for somethingcalled the Dines Letter, which will cost you only $195 a year. At the top ofthe ad, in capital letters, are the words 'Buy Internets!' And James Dines, theeditor of the newsletter, is called '"The Original Internet Bug "(TOIB)!' You could not make this stuff up if you tried."            5. "Merrill Lynch announced dazzling earnings in the latest quarter,propelled not only by a much-anticipated boom in its investment bankingbusiness but also by a remarkable influx of $36 billion in new assets frominvestors. The odd thing, of course, is that people keep pouring money intoMerrill , even though its market strategists have been among the mostbearish--and therefore most wrong--of any major bank in recent years. Neverunderestimate the power of having a bull as your corporate symbol."            6. "Latest sign that the apocalypse ... no, Y2K came and went, so this isjust the latest sign that things are getting too weird : The WallStreet Journal headlined a recent article : 'Web Frenzy Sweeps FirmsSelling Goods for Cleaning .' Let's pray the last word in that headlinenever gets changed to 'Burial.'"            7. "Ben & Jerry's ice-cream shop owners from across the country ralliedthis week to protest a possible takeover of Ben & Jerry's by acompany that has yet to be identified. The franchisees fear that the newowner will wreck Ben & Jerry's commitment to 'social responsibility,'presumably by doing things like changing the name of Cherry Garcia to BingCherry Crosby and the name of Rainforest Crunch to Burn the Rainforest To theGround Surprise."
