                                 Bad Heart of Darkness                           USAToday leads with the manufacturer's withdrawal from the market of awidely used heart drug. (The story is flagged on the Wall Street Journal front and runs inside at the Washington Post and the New YorkTimes .) The heart attack death of Nigerian dictator, Sani Abacha, leadsthe NYT and is also the top non-local story at the WP . (Abachaalso gets front-page space at the Los AngelesTimes .) The $32 billion bank merger of Wells Fargo and Norwest leads atthe LAT , which also features top of the page pictures of the threeremaining Beatles together in London at the Linda McCartney memorial service.It was their first joint public appearance since the "rooftop session" at AbbeyRoad in 1969.            Other stories getting lots of front and front-section space include: thefederal anti-trust suit brought against Intel for allegedly withholdingtechnical data from such companies as Digital and Compaq as punishment for notlicensing their technology to the chip maker; the decision of the EuropeanUnion--and soon, it's reported, of the U.S. too--to ban new investments inSerbia and to freeze its foreign assets as a sanction against Serbia for itslatest military actions against Albanians in Kosovo; and the agreement by Hondaand Ford to pay $24.9 million in civil fines to settle Justice Department andEPA claims that the companies arranged for cars to emit substantially morepollutants than they are supposed to. There is very little explanation in theseHonda/Ford stories about why the companies did this. USAT and theWP say Ford did it to improve fuel economy, but don't really get intoHonda's motivation. And the other papers miss the explanatory boat regardingboth companies.            Roche Laboratories pulled its heart drug Posicor off the world market Mondaybecause of potentially lethal interactions with numerous other medications. TheFDA, says USAT , has received reports of 24 deaths that may be related tothe medication, which is used for chest pain and high blood pressure by about400,000 patients worldwide--200,000 in the U.S.            The NYT says the death of Nigeria's Abacha, whose five-year reign was marked by hisbrutal suppression of political opponents and who had no designated successor,initially prompted hopes among Nigerian political exiles and some world leadersthat Nigeria, which had a flourishing democracy briefly in the early 1980s,might restore civilian government. But it was not to be--within hours, thedictator's defense chief was sworn in as the new leader, and for the momentanyhow, the democrats and other political prisoners remain behind bars and insome cases, under death sentences.            The LAT reports that the merger of San Francisco-based Wells Fargowith Minneapolis-based Norwest will create the nation's seventh largest bankand the largest one based west of the Mississippi. The story carries warningsfrom consumer activists of higher fees and poorer service, but also notes thatthe deal could be an economic boost to California, because the combinedoperation will be headquartered in San Francisco.                           USAT 's news section "cover story," about the NRA's attempt to gomainstream via Charlton Heston's image, is illustrated by the same loopyphotograph of Heston that the NYT used when it did that storyyesterday.            With everybody else giving President Clinton travel advice these days, theNYT 's Thomas Friedman can't resist following suit. On your way home fromChina, he writes, stop in Iran. His reasoning is pretty simple: "Looked at amap of South Asia lately? China's got the bomb. India's got the bomb.Pakistan's got the bomb. Let's see, who's next to Pakistan...Iran."            The NYT and WP report that the Secretary of Defense, WilliamCohen, announced yesterday that the Pentagon will investigate allegations madeSunday by a Time/CNN report that in a 1970 raid on a village in Laos, U.S.troops and aircraft used nerve gas on suspected American defectors livingthere. If the Cohen investigation is for real it will extend to Bobby Garwood,the last American soldier to come home alive from the Indochina war. The SECDEFshould ask Garwood if he believes he was ever targeted for death by U.S. forceswhile at large in the jungle. And here's an interesting question today'snewspaper accounts don't address: Why would there be a commando raid tokill American defectors instead of bringing them back to becourt-martialed? It might seem that this oddity proves the raids neverhappened. But think about it--if the American soldiers were in Laos in 1970,they were part of Nixon's "secret war," which had a chance to remain secretonly if...they didn't come back from it.
