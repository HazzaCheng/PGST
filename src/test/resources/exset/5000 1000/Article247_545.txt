                                 Sexual Positioning                           USAToday leads with Kathleen Willey's lawyer's defense of her motives incoming forward. The Washington Post leads with the apparent intention ofPresident Clinton's lawyer in the Paula Jones case, Robert Bennett, to submitmaterial to the trial judge today covering Jones' past sex life to rebut herclaim in her previous filings that her alleged encounter with Clinton left herwith an alleged "sexual aversion injury." The Post notes that not toolong ago, Bennett said one of the things he would not do in this trial would bego into Jones' sexual history. The New York Timesleads with the reform pledges made by China's new prime minister. And theLosAngeles Times goes with the purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers byRupert Murdoch.                           USAT reports that according to Willey's lawyer, she is "overwhelmed"by White House attempts to discredit her. Regarding the release of admiringletters she had written to Clinton after their disputed Oval Office meeting, heis quoted saying, "We don't pretend we can compete with the White House spinmachine." Reports about Willey on the WP and NYT front alsofollow up on the story broken yesterday by the New York Daily News thatprior to her "60 Minutes" appearance, she had been in discussions with atabloid.            The NYT reports that the new Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji gave apress conference in which he laid down ambitious goals for sweeping socialchange in his country, including pledges to redesign the government and cut itsstaff in half, do away with subsidized housing, and make state-owned industriessolvent, all within the next three years. But he also flatly ruled out, reportsthe Times , any reappraisal of the government's crackdown on democracy inTiananmen Square. The press conference was strikingly Western-style, says thepaper, complete with Zhu's deflection of a serious question about eventualnational elections with a quip about pictures of him in Time andNewsweek .            About a third of the LAT front is given over to coverage of the Dodger sale. In an unexpectedly one-sided vote,major league baseball owners approved the sale of the team by the O'Malleyfamily to Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group, for about $311 million, the most everpaid for a sports franchise. The move makes the team part of a world-wide mediaempire valued at nearly $27 billion. Among those assets, points out theLAT , are broadcast and cable rights to games played by 22 of the 30major league teams. And this is the aspect of the deal that is reallydifferent. A second LAT front-page piece states that the purchase price,almost double the going rate in baseball, is "so far out of the ballpark thatit's highly unlikely the team will make money," but, the paper explains,"Murdoch sees sports team as another form of content for his sprawlingtelevision empire...."            The Dodger deal is also on the front at the WP , but doesn't make theNYT front, which opts instead for a story about how George Steinbrennerhas discussed the possibility of selling a piece of the Yankees.            The Wall Street Journal reports that a jury in Muncie, Indianaruled that the nation's largest cigarette makers shouldn't be held liable inthe lung cancer death of a non-smoking nurse. Jurors said that cigarettesweren't a defective product and that the manufacturers weren't negligent forfailing to tell people that second-hand smoke was dangerous.            Both the NYT and WP fronts carry word of a new study from theFederal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a surprising rise inthe suicide rate among black teenagers. The study's authors suggest that thesurge reflects the strain black families feel in transitioning to the middleclass. One odd detail: black teenagers are much more likely than whiteteenagers to kill themselves in the presence of somebody else.            The general degree of personality-, sports- and money-euphoria surroundingthe Murdoch Dodger buy is well illustrated by the LAT front-pageeffusions of L.A. mayor Richard Riordan who is quoted saying, "I've never metanybody whose focus is better....He pays the same attention to the waiter as hedoes to the most important person in the room." Isn't that the opposite offocus?
