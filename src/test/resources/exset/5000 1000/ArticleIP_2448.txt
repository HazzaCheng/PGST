                                 Mourning Sickness            Ralph Waldo Emerson'sjournal contains this intriguing entry for March 29, 1832: "I visited Ellen'stomb and opened the coffin."            Emerson was in his late 20sat the time, a Boston minister still reeling from the loss of his young wife,who had died of tuberculosis 14 months earlier. Biographer Robert D. RichardsonJr. contends that by literally confronting death (ghoulish as it seems),Emerson was able to pull out of his funk and get back to the business ofbecoming a great American philosopher.            It isinherently unfair to pass judgment on another's grief. Yet I must confess that,just as Emerson's behavior raised my eyebrows, so, too, of late has FredGoldman's. Where once I saw a man struggling rather nobly with tragedy, I nowsee someone trapped on the merry-go-round of notoriety. Three years after thedouble murder of the century, a part of me is weary of the Ron Goldman lapelbutton, of the habitual references to "the killer," of the righteousindignation. More to the point, a part of me is wary of Fred Goldman--a clientof a large Los Angeles public-relations firm and a paid ($100,000 a year)spokesman for the Safe Streets Coalition, a victims' rights group--turning aprivate ordeal into public policy. Goldman now promotes the abolition ofunanimous-jury verdicts, the adoption of "judicial report cards," and an end tothe lifetime appointment of federal judges. "Being active is a way to focussome of that frustration, anger, etc., into something positive," saysGoldman.            Last February, Fred Goldman and his second wife, Patti,were in Washington for their 10 th wedding anniversary. They spentthe day first promoting the family's book, His Name Is Ron , in anappearance at the National Press Club, and then touring the Holocaust Museum."There's something like an Old Testament prophet quality about [Fred]," says acourt reporter who covered both Simpson trials.            Indeed,the Goldmans' rabbi told the Washington Post that Fred has become a"moral force" for justice. "God is working through him right now," says RabbiGary E. Johnson.            God sometimes works in mysterious ways. So dothe media. Thus the Goldmans and daughter Kim were back in Washington in Aprilfor the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner, a black-tie schmoozathon forjournalists, politicians, and Hollywood stars. Vanity Fair writerChristopher Hitchens notes that "it seemed rather creepy" to see Fred Goldmanin the Hilton hotel ballroom along with such mainstream trophy guests as TomSelleck and Ellen DeGeneres. How do you make small talk about bloody gloves andsize 12 Bruno Magli shoes?            TheGoldmans were invited by People magazine, whose editors graciouslypassed along to White House aides the family's desire to meet PresidentClinton. During dinner, however, Fred decided to take matters into his ownhands, and marched up to the head table.            The Secret Service intercepted him, but a backstage meetingwas arranged. The Goldmans later complained about getting only five minutesalone with the Clintons.            The Goldmans didn't havetickets to Vanity Fair 's heavily guarded post-dinner VIP party, but theygate-crashed without a problem. "They assumed they'd get in based on thismacabre celebrity," says a journalist who was there. "And they were right."            Considering all the misery the Goldmans have been through, one can't begrudgethem a night on the town and a little stargazing. What is cause for someconcern, though, is the peculiar public pedestal upon which they've beenplaced, especially since Fred now is venturing into the arena ofcriminal-justice reform. Goldman's voice is part of a rising chorus ofhigh-profile victims' rights advocates. The assemblage includes Marc Klaas,whose daughter Polly was kidnapped and murdered; John Walsh, of America'sMost Wanted fame, the father of another kidnap victim; and New York Rep.Carolyn McCarthy, who launched a political career after her husband was killedby a crazed gunman on a Long Island commuter train. Those voices deserve to beheard, but the risk is that the national crime debate will be shrouded in theemotional fog they produce.            If there is life after death, Fred Goldman willprobably chase O.J. Simpson through the tunnels of time. Perhaps rightfully so."Forgiving the person who murdered my son is not something I'm able to do," hesaid shortly before the civil trial commenced. "I think there's somethingbetween vengeance and forgiveness."            There is. It's called peaceof mind. I hope Fred Goldman finds it. But he's looking in the wrongplaces.
