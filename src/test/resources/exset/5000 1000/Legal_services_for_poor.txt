Legal services for poor facing statewide cutsSaturday, October 5, 2002LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - The loss of $1.36 million could mean thestate's legal services for the poor will lose six of their 21regional offices, the head of a poverty-law resource centersaid.It could also mean the loss of some of the 72 lawyers inKentucky for the program commonly called "Legal Aid," as well aslegal assistants and other staff."This is a major funding crisis for legal aid throughout thestate," said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access toJustice Foundation, a statewide poverty-law resource center inLexington.Legal Aid provides noncriminal legal assistance to the poor inareas such as family law, consumer fraud, housing evictions andforeclosures.Statewide, Legal Aid will lose about $800,000 in federal funds -a cut of about 13 percent from the $6 million it got this year fromthe federal Legal Services Corp., which provides most of the moneyfor Legal Aid.The state also is facing the loss of about $460,000 - nearly allthe grant money it gets through the federal Violence Against WomenAct - for legal services for poor women who suffer domesticviolence. In addition, because of lower interest rates, it isfacing a decline of about $100,000 in funds from interest collectedon lawyers' trust accounts.Hamon said directors of Kentucky's four Legal Aid programs stillare reviewing the cuts.Scott Crocker, executive director of Kentucky Legal Aid, whichserves western and southern Kentucky, said his office will loseabout $260,000 out of a budget of about $2.2 million. All of theagency's clients are poor, and many are elderly or disabled, hesaid.The Louisville region is facing the potential loss of three orfour staff members because of the cuts, said Dennis Bricking,executive director of the Louisville Legal Aid Society, whichserves Jefferson and 14 surrounding counties. The cuts will come ata time when the demand for services is increasing.Bricking said he expects to lose about $170,000 out of an annualbudget of about $3 million.Hamon said Legal Aid offices are forced to prioritize cases. Forexample, they are more likely to take on eviction cases ordomestic-violence cases if there are children involved andforeclosure cases when an elderly person has been the victim offraud and risks losing a home.Unless Congress increases funding, Kentucky will lose about$800,000 in 2003 from the federal program that supports Legal Aidbecause funds are tied to each state's poverty rate. Kentucky'spoverty rate declined about 3 percent under the latest Censusdata.States like Kentucky where poverty declined slightly sufferedcuts because other large states had significant increases inpoverty and will drain additional federal money from the LegalServices fund, Hamon said.An amendment to a Senate appropriations bill offered by Sen. TomHarkin, D-Iowa, that would increase federal Legal Aid funding ispending, but its passage is uncertain, Bricking said.Legal Aid officials are particularly worried about impoverishedareas of the state, such as eastern Kentucky, served by theAppalachian Research and Defense Fund, or APPALRED."What you've got is poor people with acute legal needs not beingable to have those needs met," said Ernie Lewis, head of the statepublic-defender system and a board member of APPALRED. "I thinkeach board and each executive director are going to have to reduceservices for poor people."He said he expects APPALRED to see a $600,000 cut in its $4million budget. Legal Aid of the Bluegrass, which serves theLexington area and northern Kentucky, could not be reached for anestimate on its cuts.Next year, Kentucky will lose almost $500,000 in grants throughthe federal Violence Against Women Act used to provide legalassistance to poor women who are victims of domestic violence. TheU.S. Justice Department declined to renew those grants under newpolicies that direct the money to start-up programs instead offunding existing programs, Hamon said.
