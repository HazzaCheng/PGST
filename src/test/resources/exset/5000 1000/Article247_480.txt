                                 Dowd and Out at the New York Times                           USAToday leads with the Japanese tax cut. The Washington Post leads with the U.S.'s approval of SouthKorea's reforms. The Los Angeles Times goes with the adverse affect the Asiandownturn is expected to have on the California economy. The New York Timeshears a different drummer and leads with President Clinton's warning to SaddamHussein that no option for dealing with him is off the table.            The main news of the USAT lead is that the Japanese government hasannounced a surprise tax cut as part of its self-bailout package. The temporarytax cut, USAT explains, is an about-face for Prime Minister Hashimoto,who had recently staked his political reputation on reducing his country'sbudget deficit. The initial reaction was favorable, says the paper: Tokyo stockprices went up, as did the yen against the dollar.            The NYT front page also covers this development, in a piece that points out that manyeconomists think the Japanese government has prolonged the Japanese downturnand that of the region by dithering. The Times also notes that theJapanese situation is braking growth well beyond Asia: as the largest creditornation, for instance, it is expected to be able to provide, for example, thelion's share of the billion dollars a day that is borrowed in U.S. markets.            The WP lead reports that President Clinton and TreasurySecretary Rubin hailed South Korea's decision to allow the won to trade freelyagainst the dollar, a move that has, the paper reports, resulted in a markedbounce-back in the currency in recent days. On the other hand, says thePost , Rubin expressed disappointment that the Japanese bailout wasn'tbigger, "more stimulative."            The LAT says that experts think the Asian crisis will costCalifornia up to 65,000 new jobs next year and will cause export growth toslow.            The president's Iraq warning came out of yesterday's press conference, whichgarnered a lot of front-page space, during which Clinton said he thinks Husseinstill has not met his international obligations regarding weapons inspection.When Clinton was asked if he thinks Saddam is crazy, he replied, reports theNYT , "Well, if he is, he's clever crazy.." USAT says the pressconference seemed "designed to counter a spate of recent news stories that haveportrayed Clinton as more engaged in his golf game than his government," andgoes on to say it was "the longest presidential news conference in thetelevision age." The WP says it was the longest one of the Clintonpresidency. The NYT says it was the "longest ever of any president."            The WP goes into much more detail about the conference'sactual questions and answers than say, the NYT , which summarizes exchanges more and puts the spacesaved thus to use making meta-comments about the goings-on. For instance, theTimes dwells quite a bit on aides' various unsuccessful attempts to gettheir boss to bring the event to a close. And it's the Times , not theWP or USAT , that notes that the president spent several minutesdescribing how he came up with the name "Buddy" for his new Labrador puppy.            The Wall Street Journal "Tax Report" notes that a bill passingthe House recently would grant accountants and other tax advisers the privilegeof client confidentiality that is currently only enjoyed in tax matters bylawyers. The change would give new privacy to taxpayers who can afford to pay atax preparer but not hire a lawyer. The Journal also notes that someaccountants see the new provision as a powerful marketing tool.            As suspected, Maureen Dowd couldn't resist the "Love Story" non-story.But since the obvious political angles had already been (over)-reported, sheopts for doing an interview with the woman who claims to be the real model forJenny. Continuing the theme of getting to the bottom of books published in1970, maybe Dowd's next column will be the unmasking of "J," who, you won'trecall, wrote "The Sensuous Woman." Maybe it'll be Tipper.
