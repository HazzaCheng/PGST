                                  The Rise of the Front Man            It is universally agreedthat the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston as speaker-designate and hisreplacement by Rep. Denny Hastert is a Bad Thing. For starters, theannunciation of Hastert, a politician who doesn't cast a shadow, exposes theanorexia in the top ranks of the House Republican Caucus. The Republicans areso strapped for talent that they had to recruit a politician no one outsideCapitol Hill had even heard of five minutes ago. (Incidentally, the House GOP'stop four leaders are now ex-wrestling coach Hastert, ex-college professor DickArmey, ex-exterminator Tom DeLay, and ex-football player J.C. Watts. Who saysAmerican politics is dominated by lawyers?)            And, as pundits arefretting, Hastert's emergence also reinforces the crisis over "the politics ofpersonal destruction" (to use the day's catch phrase). The sexual puritanism ofthe GOP's own right wing undid Livingston, and Hastert cakewalked into thespeakership only because he is--fingers crossed--above reproach. It's uncertainwhether sexual litmus testing will endure, but for the moment Washington isanxious. Many pols and ex-pols are predicting that smart, charismatic folkssuch as Livingston will now shun public office.            There is another, less talked about, reason why theascension of Hastert is alarming. Call it the Front Man Syndrome. Most peoplewould agree that in a well-run democracy, political power ought to betransparent. By this I mean that those who hold nominally powerful jobsought to exercise correspondingly real power. Title and authority shouldbe directly related. The president should be the most powerful person in theexecutive branch, the chief justice of the Supreme Court the most powerful inthe judicial branch, the speaker of the House the most powerful in the House,etc. This transparency serves democracy, because it enables voters to hold theresponsible officials accountable for their actions. You cannot hide. (Americanpolitics has not always been transparent. In the golden age of politicalmachines, for example, bosses often occupied ostensibly unimportant jobs andleft the glorious titles to their marionettes.)            But transparency may be acasualty of last week. If Democrats or Republicans fear that their leaders willbe subject to personal attack--and they do--then there is a huge incentive forthe parties to vest nominal power in squeaky-clean nonentities and hide realpower behind the scenes.            H astert may be Exhibit 1. "Coach," as he's fondly known,has a history of modest service to his party and his district, delivering pork,opposing Democratic health-care bills, etc. Mostly he has been a faithfuldeputy whip to DeLay, helping "The Hammer" count votes in the service of theconservative cause. DeLay mobilized his whip organization to ensure hisdeputy's election as speaker, and Democratic members are already wondering ifCoach will be The Hammer's tool.            It may be that Hastert will be thoroughlyindependent of DeLay--Hastert's allies assure doubters that he is his ownman--but what if he's not? House Republicans will have placed a clean,good-natured speaker at the front of their parade, a bland and acceptablepublic face for the party. Hastert won't cripple the party with a too-big mouthand too-big ideas, as Newt Gingrich did, and he won't cripple it with anembarrassing history, as Livingston did. Meanwhile, DeLay will retain the onlytrue power base in the House Republican Caucus: a 60-odd member whiporganization, the best access to corporate campaign contributions, and afearsome personality. The whip, who knows he lacks the charm and cooperativeinstincts required for speakership, will be able to run his operation quietly,behind closed doors. DeLay's job will be secure, and he himself will remain(mostly) sheltered from strict public scrutiny.            This is, of course, pessimistic speculation. It isfar too early to know whether Hastert will be DeLay's puppet. And even ifHastert is DeLay's puppet, that won't necessarily mean that Congress hasentered an era of puppetry. (A sample size of one does not an era make.) Still,it's yet one more reason--as if we need another--to worry about what happenedlast week.
