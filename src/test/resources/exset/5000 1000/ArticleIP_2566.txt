                                 The Second-Best Sauce            "There's no sauce in theworld like hunger." You may think that your grandmother made that up, butactually it was Cervantes in Don Quixote , about 400 years ago. Neither Inor any of my friends are ever hungry except for a few hours on Yom Kippur, soI am unable to test Cervantes' proposition. I will concede it to him,however.            I want totalk about the second-best sauce, which is "belonging." Food tastes enormouslybetter when it is eaten in a place where you are accepted as a special person,special for something other than the color of your credit card.            Iwas struck by this proposition about a month ago when Ispent some time with my son in Los Angeles. In the space of two days, we atefour meals--lunch and dinner and then lunch and dinner again--in the samerestaurant. My son thought the food was great; I thought it was only prettygood. He seemed disappointed that I did not share his appreciation of the food.A little later I realized what the problem was. The restaurant was a gatheringplace for people in "the business," meaning the Hollywood movie-and-TVbusiness. My son was one of them. When he came into the restaurant, peopleslapped him on the back and said, "Great show, Ben!" And he slapped someone else on the backand said, "Great show, Tom!" (or whoever). This was his club, and that made thefood taste great. But it was not my club.            I can seemany other examples of this in my eating history. The most obvious is the WhiteHouse Mess. To eat there one had to be either a fairly high-ranking official ofthe administration or the guest of such a person. That is, eating there gaveone a strong sense of special privilege. (When I was there we hadn't yetlearned that access to the privileges of the White House could be sold forcash.) And this sense of belonging made the food taste great. But the cooksthere were not graduates of the Cordon Bleu. The pices de rsistancewere the cheeseburger, the hot fudge sundae, and the Tex-Mex food on Thursdays.Objectively speaking, one could get better food at any of six restaurantswithin two blocks of the White House. But the judgment of the food in the WhiteHouse Mess was not an objective judgment.            One doesn't have to eat in "high-class"surroundings to get this delicious feeling of belonging. For some time after wewere married I used to tell my wife about the great meals prepared by Freddiethe Cook. That referred to my college days. I had been the dishwasher at afraternity house. The waiters were all members of the fraternity and ate thesame meals in the same dining room as the other members. But I was not amember, so I ate in the kitchen with the other kitchen help who were notstudents and who were all "colored," as we used to say. We in the kitchen feltthat we were getting the best of everything, better and fresher food than wasserved to the members upstairs. What it all was, I no longer remember, with oneexception: For dessert I often had a quart brick of vanilla ice cream bathed inthe wonderful syrup extracted from the sugar maples around Williamstown, Mass.But Freddie was really a mediocre cook.            There was a time, probablynow past, when medium-price restaurants would advertise themselves as serving"home cooking." They were trying to play upon the memory of home cooking ashaving been very good cooking. But the odds were against your mother havingbeen a very good cook. It was mainly the feeling of having been part of thefamily that made the food there seem so good in retrospect.            Goodrestaurants exploit this feeling. They know that you will enjoy the food moreif the headwaiter greets you as "Mr. Jones" without having to look in his bookwhen you come in. That is, if your name is Jones. Otherwise, to be called"Jones" spoils the meal.            Ihave eaten in some three-star restaurants in mytime--almost always on someone else's expense account. Only one of those mealswas memorable. That was in a restaurant off the Champs lyses where I orderedin the belief that it was veal with rice. Quelle horreur!                        Surely there are exceptionsto my general rule. There must be people with palates so fine that evenblindfolded they could tell the difference between food from La Tour d'Argentand food from McDonald's. And there probably is some food so good that even I,eating it in a strange place, would recognize its merit. But, in general, myrule holds. If you are not hungry, eat where you belong!
