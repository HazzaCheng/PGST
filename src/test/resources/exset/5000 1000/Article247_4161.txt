                                 Bush and Bradley at a Crossroads?                        Issue 1 is John McCain's continuing surge in New Hampshire. Issue 2 is AlGore's heated attacks on Bill Bradley.            Most pundits think that George W. Bush's mediocre performance in his twodebate appearances has made him vulnerable, but pundits disagree over just howvulnerable. On NBC's Meet thePress , the Des Moines Register 's David Yepsen predicts thatMcCain will do well in Iowa even without campaigning there, but John Bachman,of Des Moines' WHO-TV, says that his station's recent poll shows McCain stillbehind Bush by 40 points. On Fox NewsSunday , Tony Snow points out that Bush's national lead hasn'tbudged--despite his trouble in New Hampshire--but Brit Hume predicts thatBush's debate performances will start a popularity slide in the early primarystates. On CNN's LateEdition , Steve Roberts asserts that Bush supporters are uneasy withhis debate performance, but Susan Page notes that Bush is still theoverwhelmingly likely nominee.On ABC's This Week , Bill Kristol, ever the neoconservative, continuesto support reformist underdog McCain, while George F. Will, ever the Tory,continues to argue for establishmentarian front-runner Bush. Will points outthat the GOP establishment's endorsement of Bush was completely voluntary andthat grassroots uprisings, as McCain is attempting to bring about, are notalways good for the party--look at what George McGovern did to the Democrats.Kristol counters that despite McGovern's failure as a presidential candidate,his empowerment of the Democratic Party's grassroots was healthy. Kristol thenpredicts that once Bush debates in Iowa tomorrow his polls will start slidingthere.            With a few exceptions--such as Mark Shields (PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ) and Jack Germond ( Meetthe Press )--the pundits agree that Bill Bradley must respond to Al Gore'scharge that Bradley would raise taxes as president. Paul Gigot( NewsHour and Meet the Press ) and Tucker Carlson ( LateEdition ) both think that Bradley must fight back to stay alive. (Gigotcalls it Bradley's "moment of truth.") Juan Williams ( Fox ) and TuckerCarlson say that Gore's attack-dog campaigning has reminded the Bush peoplethat a general-election fight against the vice president would be no cakewalk.Most pundits agree that Bradley's recently disclosed heart problem is not a bigdeal.Interviews et cetera: The Fox panel makes up for itskid-gloves treatment of Kenneth Starr several weeks ago (see the Nov. 15 "PunditCentral") by grilling John McCain--and McCain rises to the occasion. TonySnow asks McCain who his favorite Supreme Court Justice is, and when McCainsays Sandra Day O'Connor, Snow asks him to name an area in which she has had alasting effect on constitutional law. After a short pause, McCain answers:Native American rights. When Brit Hume asks McCain about Dean Acheson's role inthe firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, McCain responds that he admires Acheson'sinvolvement because the dismissal was necessary to assure civilian control ofthe military at the start of the Cold War. ... While McCain is on the program,the Fox producers flash a message on the screen asserting that, withan IQ of 133, McCain would be "among the most intelligent Presidents inhistory."John McCain No Vive La Vida Loca                                                                        Fox : Your favorite rock band is ...                           McCain: Nine Inch Nails. My daughter, who is now 15, haskept me up to speed. I think the Backstreet Boys are her favorite, but I'mterribly concerned--she seems enamored with Ricky Martin. I know that he's ahandsome guy, but that's not the one I want her to marry.                           Last Word                        The practical effect of that will be that the New York Times , thetrial lawyers, the labor unions, and the Sunday shows will have all theinfluence over the presidential campaign from about March [until theelection].                           --Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on John McCainand Bill Bradley's agreement to forego soft money donations if they becometheir respective party's presidential nominees ( Meet the Press )                        Gore and Bush, I hear, are going to have a joint event funded by soft moneyon K Street--to contrast the McCain-Bradley campaign-finance-reformevent--co-hosted by Terry McAuliffe, Bill Clinton's fund raiser, and HaleyBarbour, the former Republican [National Committee] chairman.                           --Bill Kristol, joking on This Week
