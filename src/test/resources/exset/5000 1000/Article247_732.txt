                                 Outlook Bats .00            The New York Times ' lead says that the U.S. will provideseveral billion dollars of aid to Brazil, as part of a $30 billioninternational package to help stave off financial turmoil there. The Washington Post 's lead covers a local election race; theoff-lead describes the international reach of American pop culture. TheLosAngeles Times leads with a new poll showing Democrat Gray Davis handilyleading Republican Dan Lungren (53 to 42%) in the California gubernatorialrace. The LAT 's top national story (fronted all around) is Friday'skilling of a prominent abortion doctor in upstate New York. The doctor, BarnettSlepian, was shot in his home Friday night by a sniper who was lurking in thebushes. Over the last four years years, four other abortion doctors have beenwounded in the region, and just days ago authorities had warned of possible newattacks.            The NYT lead says that details of the U.S. aid to Brazil are stillbeing hammered out, and that the U.S. aid package itself has not yet beenpublicly announced. President Clinton may approve the package during Congress'srecess, but since lawmakers are concerned about Brazil's financial straits theyare unlikely to pose major objections. Nonetheless, the administration isapproaching the issue warily, recalling the Congressional storm over a 1995commitment of $20 billion to bail out Mexico. The bulk of the internationalloan to Brazil will come from the International Monetary Fund ($15 billionplus), and the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank ($9 billiontogether).            Money is not America's only gift to Brazil, as the WP 's lengthy leadreminds us. The Post tracks Madonna to Sao Paulo, Bart Simpson to Seoul,and the word "cool" to every spot on the planet. The article meanders into adebate over whether the near-universal English language helps fuel the overseassuccess of American pop culture (or vice versa--do people learn English fromAmerican movies?). The piece then raises the host of moral debates associatedwith the global onset of pop culture--should Beverly Hills, for example, reallybe mandatory viewing for half the world's population?            All papers have big spreads on the Middle East peace wrap-up. Among thearticles: A WP front pager details how Clinton's personal charm andfamed wordplay ability nudged the negotiations through tight spots. TheLAT stresses the new intermediary role the U.S. will assume in policingthe agreement's implementation. A NYT piece says that Palestinians, waryand weary from empty past peace accords, have greeted the latest installmentwith "zero jubilation."            On the Kosovo front, the papers report yesterday's U.N. Security Councilvote, which apparently gave NATO a mandate for military intervention in Kosovo.However, the resolution was softened to the point of ambiguity by the dissent(and eventual abstention) of Russia and China; the NYT says the UNSCresolution "skirts an outright threat to use force." Of particular concern isNATO's capacity to protect the 2000 unarmed international monitors arriving inKosovo to oversee the implementation of the Holbrooke-Milosevic deal.            The NYT Week in Review and the WP Outlook sections are awashwith Pinochet's arrest, Kosovo, and the Middle East. Of particular interest isa WP op-ed by Genaro Arriagada, the Chilean Ambassador to theU.S. and the architect of Pinochet's defeat in 1988. Arriagada argues forPinochet's release on two fronts: that international law governing Pinochet'sarrest is extremely nebulous, and that the arrest impedes Chile's path towardreconciliation.            An excellent WP "Style" article visits the bizarre Wisconsin headquarters of the "Onion,"the popular, crude parody newspaper. When they're not busy painting theirfingernails silver, editors there dream up headlines like "Midwest' DiscoveredBetween East, West Coasts" and "U.S. Ambassador to Bulungi Suspected of MakingCountry Up."            The millennial blooper award goes to Outlook. Outlook's name-the-00s-decadecontest raked in creative entries from "Pre-Teens" to the "O-Zone." Outlook'sverdict? "We considered dozens of qualified candidates, and it was so difficultto choose a winner that we didn't."
