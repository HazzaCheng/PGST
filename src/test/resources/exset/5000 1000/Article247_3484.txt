                                 Trying To Read the Fed's Mixed Messages                        In William Greider's long book on the Federal Reserve, Secrets of theTemple (a fascinating book but, in retrospect, a remarkably ill-consideredindictment of inflation-fighting), there's not much mention of the conversionof the Federal Reserve into a bully pulpit. But as today's quarter-point hikein the discount rate--in addition to the expected quarter-point hike in thefederal funds rate--demonstrates, the Fed has, at some point in the last fiveyears or so, come to see inflation-fighting as not merely a matter of raisingor lowering rates. It's also a matter of sending the right messages to the bond(and, to a lesser extent, the stock) markets.            I've touched on this point once before, when the Fed announced at its lastmeeting that it was keeping interest rates steady but changing its bias. Whereonce the Fed kept its deliberations secret and acted as sphinxlike as possibleabout its intentions, it now tries to indicate what it's concerned about andthe direction in which it's leaning. In one sense, this has made the exerciseof trying to game the Fed easier, since there's more material to go on. Inanother sense, it's made everything trickier, since there are a host of signalsto interpret, and sometimes they're not in harmony.            Today, for instance, the Fed didn't make what would have been the surprisingmove, namely hiking interest rates by 50 basis points instead of 25. (One basispoint is equal to one-hundredth of a point.) Had it pushed through the largerhike, the sell-off in the stock market would probably have been frightening, atleast at first. But the increase would certainly have slammed the brakes on aneconomy that's still running very hot.            You might assume that the quarter-point hike means the Fed isn't thatworried about inflation, even though there are signs that continued strongdemand and tight labor markets are beginning to make themselves felt. But thenthere's the discount-rate hike to consider. This is the first time since thespring of 1995 that the Fed has increased the discount rate (which is theinterest rate the Fed charges banks who want to borrow money from it). Andwhile the discount rate itself is not that important, which is to say that anincrease in it will have no material effect on the economy, the message theincrease sends is important, and that message is that the Fed is more concernedabout inflation than the small hike in the federal funds rate would indicate. Ithink.            In addition to the rate increases, the Fed also shifted its bias back towardneutral, which suggests that the economy is still growing faster than Greenspanbelieved it would be. But the fact that the Fed isn't biased toward furthertightening suggests that the economy isn't necessarily growing faster thanGreenspan would like it to be.            Got all that? Good, because I'm not sure that I do.            In the long run, worrying about all this stuff probably doesn't matter verymuch. The Fed and the bond market will determine how fast the economy goes bydetermining interest rates, and the concrete impact of the federal funds rateand of the Fed's printing or not-printing money will far outweigh anypsychological effect of the Fed's symbolic gestures. But it also seems truethat Greenspan has come to recognize the beneficial effect of using thosegestures to push interest rates in a certain direction without the Fed's havingto take concrete action. It's as if he can speed things up or slow them downwithout doing much of anything real.            Of course, mixed messages are a persistent danger here, as evidenced bytoday's herky-jerky market, where bond prices rose sharply, while the Dowmeandered and the Nasdaq actually went up. But the truth is that in the end themarket will do a good job of sorting through the messages and finding the onesthat matter. It's trying to interpret the messages on your own--like I justtried to do--that's a recipe for utter confusion.
