                                 Jury Dullification            Day One of the Senate impeachment trial leads all around. Banner headlinesare the order of the day. The LAT and NYT headlines focus the most on PresidentClinton's alleged conduct, with the former citing charges of "perjury" and"obstruction," and the latter charges of "egregious and criminal conduct."USAT's big print emphasizes procedure, with "Prosecutors: Call WitnessesAgainst Clinton." The WP header combines form and substance with "ProsecutorsLay Out Clinton's 'Scheme'" running over a reference to their request forwitnesses. But only the NYT headline mentions what this is allabout--the House's attempt to remove Clinton from office.            The WSJ observes that three of the four House prosecutors who spokeyesterday have substantial courtroom experience with the Justice Dept or aslocal prosecutors, and that they emphasized the more difficult to prove of thetwo impeachment articles, obstruction of justice.            The NYT excels today at focusing on clear detail. The paper notes anew argument from prosecutor Rep. James Sensenbrenner on the topic of whetheror not perjury counts as a high crime or misdemeanor, namely that bribery islisted as a high crime and under federal sentencing guidelines, perjury andbribery carry the same penalty. Also, it's the NYT that makes thestriking point that despite all the day's presentations and those to come, therules of impeachment leave senators "free to vote as they choose for whateverreasons they cho[o]se or for no stated reason at all, without regard to theusual rules of evidence."            Among the House members who pressed the case against Clinton, The NYTgives the highest marks to Rep. Asa Hutchinson. The Times saysHutchinson made some fresh points out of familiar details, and then the paperclearly states them: 1) In response to the White House claim that any helpgiven to Monica Lewinsky in her job search was not a quid pro quo because thehelp preceded Lewinsky's role in the Paula Jones case, Hutchinson showed hownonetheless the job search assistance effort became markedly more urgent onceshe did have such a role; 2) To the White House claim that President Clintoncould not have been attempting to sway Betty Currie's testimony because his oddconversation with her took place before she was called as a witness, Hutchinsonobserved that Clinton had just been questioned at length in the Jonesdeposition about Currie and hence it was clear to him then that she was likelyto be called; 3) To the White House claim that President Clinton's denial of asexual relationship with Lewinsky was literally true because of the odddefinition of such relations he was presented with, Hutchinson points out thatLewinsky's denial predates the appearance of that definition and hence shouldbe considered a common sense falsehood that Clinton encouraged. By contrast,the Post spares the reader these details, saying only that Hutchinsonpresented his case "with a bit of folksiness and some narrative drive."            The difference here is an important one. The Post 's assessment occursin the off-lead, a piece lamenting the absence of cross-examination and witnessbreakdowns. The reporter, David Von Drehle, immediate past honcho of thepaper's "Style" section (not, please note, its "Substance" section), marvelsthat senators could sit still and pay attention to all this. His piece runsunder the headline, "On The Floor, The First Day Wore On, On, On." The paper'stelevision critic, Tom Shales, is similarly restless: "Who'd have thought," heasks, "that making history could be such excruciatingly ponderous torture?" Inother words, by the Post 's lights, it's not that the House Republicansare mean-spirited, unfair, or immobilizing the government. It's much worse thanthat: they're not entertaining . This confusion of merit with style iscatching on. The LAT lead editorial, arguing that Clinton's misdeeds arenot impeachable, is headlined "We've Heard it Before."            Meanwhile, the WP reports that every day this week, U.S. fighter jetshave attacked Iraqi anti-aircraft and surface-to-air missile batteries. But themajors' editors have consistently stuffed these incidents inside. Indeed, thePost dispatch is on page...25.
