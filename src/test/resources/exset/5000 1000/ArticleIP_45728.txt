                                  My Day as a Murder Suspect            I like to think of myself as a responsible,upstanding guy (even though I sell advertising for                   Slate               ). So itwas a bit of a shock yesterday to find myself detained as a suspect during amanhunt for a killer.            My troubles started on a flight home to Seattlefrom Washington, D.C. I wanted to check in on my brother, Joshua--who lives ina sailboat on Seattle's Lake Union--so I tried to call him from the plane. Overthe phone, I got word that Joshua had sailed out from the marina around 5 p.m.the night before, and nobody had seen or heard from him since. This is unlikeJoshua--or any other Krohn boy, for that matter. We're the sort who will letsomeone know if we think we're going to be late for work, much less out on anall-night boat ride.            Things got worse after I landed in Seattle. At theairport I saw President Clinton on television saying something about senselessacts of violence, and I assumed he was referring to the shootings inHonolulu--until he mentioned Seattle. I made a few calls and learned that fourpeople had been shot at the Northlake Shipyard, which is less than two blocksfrom the marina where my brother keeps his boat (and where I dock myhouseboat). What if Joshua has been shot? I thought.            I took a cab toward thescene of the crime. As we pulled up, I saw that the police had blocked off theroad near the marinas. An officer told me that we couldn't drive any farther,although pedestrians were allowed in the area, and I was free to walk home. Itdid strike me as strange that the police would grant public access to the areawhere a lunatic shooter was still on the loose. But the place looked prettysafe--it was crawling with SWAT teams, helicopters, rifle-toting policemen, copcars, police dogs, and armored vehicles--and I needed to get home and searchfor my brother, so I started walking.            Not far down the street, an officer stopped me and, to myamazement, got ready to draw his pistol. "You've got the wrong guy," I said."I'm just coming home from a business trip." "Shut up," he said. As he barkedinstructions--keep your hands in the air, spread your legs -- I felthelpless. I was just an innocent civilian trying to get home. But I'm atwentysomething white male, and yesterday I happened to be unshaven and wearinga trench coat, so I fit the description of the shooter--though I didn't know itat the time. Officers interrogated, thumb-cuffed, and body-searched me. I waspatted in places I've never been patted before. "I'm not the guy," I saidagain. "For your protection and mine, stop talking and let me finish my job,"the officer replied.            Once he'd checked the address on my driver'slicense, the policeman realized that my story made sense. He let me go andsuggested I proceed with caution: "You fit the description of the suspect."When I told him I was trying to get home to find my brother, who'd gonemissing, we started all over again. "What does he look like?" he asked,apparently now wondering whether Joshua might be the shooter. "He looks justlike me," I said, "but he's probably drowning if I can't get him some help."The police started asking questions about Josh: Does he do drugs? No. Is hementally stable? I think so. Did he ever serve in the military? Well, yes--heattended the Merchant Marine Academy and was in the Naval Reserves, which (asone officer pointed out) meant he had experience with guns. But apparently Isaid something that eased their minds about Joshua; they told me I could go,and they'd get in touch with me if necessary.            Once I got home, friendstold me that the engine on Joshua's boat had died the night before, that he'dbeen rescued by a branch of the Coast Guard, and that he was sailing his boatin instead of letting the Coast Guard tow him. Several hours later we watchedwith relief as he sailed into the marina. Not a bad alibi.
