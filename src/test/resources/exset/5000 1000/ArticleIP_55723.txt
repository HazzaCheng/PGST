                                 Profiting From Politics            Forgetretailing. On the Net, the next hot online business is politics. Consider: OnVoter.com, a site that launchedlast week, voters can fill out e-questionnaires and search for the candidateswith whom they most often agree. On Politics.com, another new site, voters can plug in their ZIPcodes to search Federal Election Commission filings to see who their neighborsdonated to. On Vote.com, a siterun by ex-Clinton adviser Dick Morris, citizens can answer a poll and havee-mails stating their positions automatically shipped to senators andrepresentatives.            On theeve of the 2000 presidential election, the world of politics has shown it canembrace the Internet by offering a slew of for-profit Web sites. These andother sites are arming voters with tools that they have never had before tofind information and express views. As a host of entrepreneurs chase theInternet gravy train, the question is whether politics can form the basis of areal company. Can a political Web site go public and raise millions?            "It'snot like selling books on the Internet," concedes Jerry Anderson, a partnerwith Skywood Ventures, a Sand Hill Road VC firm that is funding Voter.com,which proposes to make revenue via personalization and advertising. "This isnew and different and no one has done this before. ... We believe that lots ofother people have made a business out of providing these messages and providingthe medium. We don't see any reason why it won't be the same for theInternet."            Already, there are political content sites sponsored by major news outlets,such as the Washington Post 's OnPolitics feature, where people cansearch for information via their ZIP code. There are party sites. And there arenonprofit sites that have made names for themselves by providing qualitypolitical information. One such site is the Democracy Network, which won arecent FEC ruling lifting the ban on nonprofits hosting online candidatedebates. Other sites are experimenting with technology, such as FreedomChannel.com, whichprovides video-on-demand of the presidential candidates, broken down byissue.            "Wethought at a time when you're introducing a new technology, it is probably wiseto do so in a way that encourages public trust rather than public distrust,"says FreedomChannel founder Doug Bailey. "For-profit sites face the same hurdleas any other site on the Internet: What is the motive behind the peopleproviding the information? That begs the next question: What do they do withthe information I give them? What's their agenda?"            MarcJacobson, president of Politics.com, a general-interest political content site,says that since politics is already a huge business in the physical world,there's no reason it shouldn't be in the online world. The business model forPolitics.com involves selling ads. "It's the older, more educated, moreaffluent people who vote, and they also have higher Internet use," notesJacobson, a former Prodigy exec. "I think that car manufacturers and computermanufacturers are all going to want to speak to this audience."            Voter.com, a site that uses personalization features to put people in touchwith candidates, is also seeking ad revenues. The company contends thatcandidates and campaigns will be a source of this advertising, once the sitestarts to build traffic. "There's been a constant argument on the Web since thebeginning. There's always been a push to do things for free for the good of theworld," says Justin Dangel, Voter.com's 25-year-old founder, who has every hopeof going IPO someday. "To pay for the resources to create a first-classpolitical Web site," including staff, technology and marketing, Voter.com hadto be for-profit, he adds.            Someobservers are skeptical about the business models being proposed by the newpolitical sites. "There is no money to be made billing for sending messages tothe government," says Michael Cornfield, a professor at George WashingtonUniversity.            DickMorris, who paid $250,000 for the Vote.com domain name, believes his site willhelp citizens express their views to elected officials. But the site has beencriticized by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and other pundits for "spamming" thegovernment.            Snaps Morris: "Anybody whothinks that getting a communication from a voter in your district is spam--thatguy is pork. Roast pork unless he changes his point of view."
