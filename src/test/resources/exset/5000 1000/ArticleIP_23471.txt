Randy'sWrap-Up                        One of the mostexhausting lessons of adolescence is discovering that just because you'vesettled an issue in your head--i.e., racism is bad; my history teacher is sucha liar--does not mean it is settled in the actual world. Racism persists andyou must still write your report on the opening of the American frontier. Oneof the most exhausting lessons of adulthood is discovering that just becauseyou've settled an issue in the actual world--i.e., abortion is legal; mycomputer is fixed--doesn't mean you won't have to keep settling it again andagain. History is not a synonym for progress. No issue is ever settled. No caseis ever closed. And so, even after the death of Jesse James, the people ofMissouri must vote on the same policies over and over. But at least I won'thave to write an essay about it on my balky computer, and that's progress. Ordecrepitude.                           UnconcealedAnswer                        "Missourians do not want guns carried intofootball games and bars and schools."            Tuesday, despite a $3.7million campaign by the National Rifle Association, Missouri voted down anattempt to lift the ban on concealed weapons. Forty-three states currentlypermit concealed weapons.                           Jon Delfin's Insidethe Industry Extra: M*A*S*H                                       I'm told that every nowand then a memo would arrive from above, demanding a TV Guide -typeprecis for the next episode. Since the episode might well not have been writtenyet, they had a stockpile of generic descriptions: "It's winter at the 4077,and all hell breaks loose in the OR" One week, hearing that CBS had begundeveloping a new show, Trapper John, M.D. starring Pernell Roberts, theysent in "Hawkeye receives word from home that Trapper John is dead." CBS didn'tsee the humor in this.                           Ultradull WeekendBonus Question                        A big third-of-a-page ad on the op-ed page ofWednesday's New York Times criticizing military procurement policies wasplaced by BusinessLeaders for Sensible Priorities, perhaps the most boring name ever devisedfor an organization. Separately, each of these words is dense with tedium, butcollectively ... Sorry ... where was I? Must have dozed off.            Participants are invitedto create an even more torpid name for an even more lacklusterorganization.
