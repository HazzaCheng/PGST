                                 White House Leaks            The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times lead with important Republican and Democratic lawmakers'calls over the weekend for President Clinton to definitively explain his rolein the Lewinsky matter. USA Today 's lead covers this too, but higher up and in itsheadline, emphasizes the possibility that Lewinsky's just-agreed-to grand jurytestimony could come this week. The Washington Post lead covers the federal government'sresponse to the Y2K problem.            Now that "White House leak" has taken on a whole new meaning, presidentialliquid imagery has caught on: the NYT notes in its lead headline thatSen. Orrin Hatch said that President Clinton should "pourhis heart out" to the American people about his relationship with MonicaLewinsky. (Then there's the LAT 's economical but imagisticallyunfortunate headline, "Both Sides Urge Clinton to Tell Truth on Lewinsky.") Atheme of the coverage is that the call for a Clinton mea culpa is becomingbipartisan.            The WP lead states that fixing the feds' part of the millenium bug will cost at least $5billion. There are, after all, 7,336 "mission critical" U.S. governmentcomputer systems, ranging from ones controlling Tomahawk missiles to thoseprocessing student loans. The WP says 40 percent of these crucialsystems can now be declared ready to work on Jan. 1, 2000. Clearly there is anincreasing sense of Y2K gravitas among the big dailies: There was yesterday'sNYT lead editorial calling for congressional creation of tax incentivesand subsidies for solutions, and the Post lead is the second in aseries. And inside, the Post runs four more millenium efforts: one onthe history of the awareness of the problem, one on the IRS' approach, anotherstating that the FAA is now back on track with its portion, and one pointingout an easily overlooked aspect of the Pentagon's Y2K troubles--namely thatthey include planning for the glitches possibly experienced by othermilitaries.                           USAT and the WP continue to work the amazing story they brokelast week of the two three-year-old girls discovered to have been switchedshortly after birth at the University of Virginia hospital. The WPreports that U-VA officials have decided they will not tell Paula Johnson whohas her biological daughter until a court resolves the mess. That's okay--allMs. Johnson has to do is read today's USAT , which names the child and the couplewho had been raising her thinking she was theirs. The Nation's Newspaper adds afurther shocker to this real-life O. Henry tale: the couple was killed in aJuly 4th traffic accident.            Both the NYT and WP fronts cover Castro's warm reception in Granada, where in 1983, U.S.troops clashed with Cuban soldiers and construction workers. The Postpiece says Castro is making diplomatic inroads in the English-speakingCaribbean as U.S. aid drops, while the NYT notes that it was the U.S.that actually finished the airport the Cubans were working on at the time ofthe invasion. Although the NYT text mentions that both U.S. and Cubanswere killed in the fighting, the caption under an accompanying picture insideonly mentions the Cuban deaths.            The WP runs a fine Walter Pincus story inside on a woefullyunderreported topic, that of U.S. military sales to foreign governments. Itseems that the current Pentagon budget has created a perverse incentive: themore surplus ships are sold overseas, the more extra weapons the Pentagon canpurchase. Under the arrangement, the DOD gets an additional $600 million ingoodies while near-state-of-the-art ships are going to sworn enemies Turkey (14vessels) and Greece (11).            Even as the Wall Street Journal editorial page rails against theprogressive income tax's bite on high-income types, the Journal 's frontoffers a more grounded look at big earners these days, noting a whiney newdevelopment among many professionals with annual incomes of nearly $200,000:envy of those who, thanks to booming job and stock markets, make even more.            The WP 's "Science Notebook" reports a finding that may upset many aGreenpeace campaign. Researchers in Scotland and the U.S. have found evidencethat adult male bottlenose dolphins sometimes deliberately beat their young todeath. Some biologists speculate that they do this so that their mothers wouldbe willing to mate again more quickly.            The NYT reports that the Guggenheim museum is hosting the most highlyattended exhibition in its 61-year history, far outstripping Lichtenstein andRauschenberg retrospectives. Five thousand people a day, most of them who'venever before been to the Guggenheim or any other museum, are coming to see adisplay of motorcycles. One featured lecturer: Dennis Hopper.
