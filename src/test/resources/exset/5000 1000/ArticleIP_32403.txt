                                 Budget Fudging            President Clinton opened his hourlong news conference Thursday with a defenseof his budget proposals and a critique of Republican tax-cut plans. Newspapersduly reported his quarrels with the GOP over revenue projections and the costof new Medicare benefits. Which side will prevail on these matters remains tobe seen. But the underlying struggle to shape the terms of the debate remainsinvisible to the media. And Clinton is winning that struggle hands down.                           1.Whose money is it? President Reagan used to argue constantly that federalmoney belonged to taxpayers, not "bureaucrats." Later, House Speaker NewtGingrich took up this theme. But now both men are gone, and nobody in the GOPseems capable of battling Clinton's counterspin. Clinton chooses words thatoblige the media and the public to look at every financial question from thestandpoint of the government rather than the taxpayer. The Republican tax cutplan will "cost" too much and cause "an enormous loss to the American people,"Clinton argued Thursday. This obscures the alternative point of view--thattaxes themselves impose "costs" and "losses" on everyone who has to pay theInternal Revenue Service.            Likewise, Clinton shrewdly portrays tax cuts as a kind of "spending." At hisnews conference, he questioned how Republicans could "finance" their tax cuts.Words such as these dissolve the moral difference between giving money "back"to the people it came from, as Reagan and Gingrich used to put it, and passingit on to others instead. Once the question is framed as how to "finance" taxcuts--implying that the government owns the money and gets to decide who shouldreceive it--conservatives can't win.                           2.Who can spend it more wisely? Conservatives used to frame this question asa choice between government "spending" and private "investment." "Investment"meant the money was working and growing. "Spending" meant it was being wasted.Clinton has turned this language on its head. "We must decide whether to investthe surplus, to strengthen America over the long-term, or to squander it forthe short-term," he argued Thursday. To "squander" the money, in Clinton'slanguage, is to "spend" it on tax cuts. To "invest" it is to allocate it to"long-term goals," which used to be called government programs.            Clinton constantly borrows capitalist terminology to make federal budgetdecisions appear as productive as corporate budget decisions. At his newsconference, he made clear that allocating money to poverty-stricken parts ofthe country isn't subsidizing the poor; it's "investing in America's newmarkets." Adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare isn't additionalspending; it's "modernizing" the program to meet future needs.                           3.Who deserves it most? Reagan used to dominate the moral dimension of budgetdebates by posing a choice between hard-working taxpayers and irresponsiblebeneficiaries of government programs. Clinton's greatest feat has been toreverse this hierarchy. The question, as he put it Thursday, is no longerwhether to spend more money on programs but whether "to meet our basicresponsibilities in education, defense, the environment," and othercommitments.            Whatabout the government's responsibility to taxpayers? Clinton explained that incontrast to the GOP's "risky" tax-relief plan, he favors only "tax cuts we canafford," since we must maintain "fiscal discipline." "We" refers, of course, tothe government. "Afford" makes clear that it's the government's money and thattax cuts are a secondary and purely elective consideration. Our"responsibilities" come first, and to forsake "fiscal discipline" by cuttingtaxes would be immoral as well as imprudent. This spin keeps the alternativeinterpretation of fiscal discipline--cutting taxes first, and then cuttingspending accordingly--conveniently out of the picture.            Goodspin wins the issue of the day, but great spin goes further. It wins the warinvisibly, by skewing the debate at such a deep level that the media can't seeit. And it so permeates public discourse that even the opposition helplessly orunwittingly succumbs. Four months ago, when George W. Bush launched hispresidential exploratory committee, he defended tax cuts by arguing that it was"compassionate" of political leaders "to give people more money." That's not achallenge to Bill Clinton. That's a tribute.
