                                 How Vietnam Could Have Been Saved                        Jim:            Hmmm, Ronald Reagan's on your side and not mine? I don't think so. He wasthe fellow who declared in 1980 that America's intervention in Vietnam was a"noble cause"--and the press trumpeted the comment as a gaffe. This didn'tbother Reagan, who was used to such treatment, and it didn't affect hisposition on Vietnam. He not only supported the war; he often voiced theconservative argument that Washington politicians had prevented the generals inVietnam from pursuing a winning strategy. (Lind rejects this view, and so doI.) As president, Reagan was willing to commit American troops, but he didn'tneed to. The Reagan doctrine of backing anti-Communist guerrillas around theworld worked. Reagan pulled the Marines out of Lebanon both because of thebombing that killed 250 of them and because the Marines didn't have a missionthere in the first place. This doesn't make him a minimal realist. The truthis, the Marines should never have been sent in.            I think we disagree over what constitutes revisionism. The kind I'd beenlooking for would bring fresh analysis and a new interpretation of events. Thelate Peter Braestrup did that in Big Story , which showed how badly thepress had misreported the Tet Offensive in 1968 and repercussions it caused.McNamara didn't do that; he simply embraced the left's contention that the warwas unwinnable and America shouldn't have intervened. I have to plead amnesiaon what Nixon and Podhoretz said exactly. I read their Vietnam books, but Idon't remember them. Must be old age.            The problem with so much that's been written about the war is that it stopsin 1968. At the time, things did not look good for South Vietnam, despite theutter failure of the Viet Cong to achieve what they wanted in the TetOffensive. The United States was still tied to the Westmoreland strategy ofstaging big battles. But post-Westmoreland, things did get better, but themedia scarcely noticed. To cite one example, in A Bright Shining Lie ,one of the most riveting books about the war, Neil Sheehan doesn't takeevidence that the war was finally being won by the United States and SouthVietnam seriously. Nor do most others who covered the war. They're frozen intime, I think, and that time was 1968. By the way, I know of only twojournalists who wrote about the war critically and then lamented the outcomeand what they'd written. They are William Shawcross and Jean Lacouture.            Casualties. Americans definitely are casualty-sensitive. I'm reminded ofthis every morning and night when my commute takes me past the VietnamMemorial. There's always a crowd there. I think it's partly because people feelthese soldiers haven't got a fair shake from historians, the media, etc.Anyway, Lind is right that if casualties had stayed at the 1968 level, therewould have been a huge political price to pay at home, far bigger than the onethat was actually paid. But they didn't stay at that level. President Nixonbegan bringing American troops home in 1969. Nonetheless, the war went better.The South Vietnamese fought better. The Viet Cong were driven away from theoutskirts of Saigon and isolated in pockets. By 1970, the U.S. side had theupper hand. And some have claimed the war was essentially won. The first time Iheard this argument was in 1978 when I took a course on the military at MIT. Itwas taught by Prof. William Kauffman, who used to write the Pentagon's annualposture statement. I didn't believe him at the time. But more recently the casehas been made strongly by the late William Colby in Lost Victory and,just this year, by Lewis Sorley in A Better War .            All this leads to a question I'd like you to answer. It's about the Koreamodel. What if the United States had not pulled all its troops out of Vietnam,but left, say, two divisions behind and kept up military and economic aid?Might South Vietnam have been--you won't like this word--saved? I think so. Ofcourse, I'm rewriting history here. In reality, Henry Kissinger allowed theNorth Vietnamese to keep thousands of troops in South Vietnam when henegotiated the 1972 peace settlement, and all the U.S. troops came home, andall aid was cut off in 1975.            Lind mentions the Korea model, but doesn't really pursue this point. What'syour view, Jim?
