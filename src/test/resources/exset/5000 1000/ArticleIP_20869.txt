                                 Whitehall No Longer?            The top British story is amassive strengthening of the country's anti-racism laws. As a result of areport on the 1993 case of Stephen Lawrence, a young black man whose murder waspoorly responded to and inadequately investigated by the police, Home SecretaryJack Straw declared all-out war on racist government action. Calling theLawrence case "a catalyst" and "a watershed," he announced that the police andgovernment officials will now be personally and criminally liable for anyexpressions of the "institutional racism" common in British life. Nevertheless,the reforms are less aggressive than those sought by the independent commissionthat investigated the case. The                   Times                reports that those recommendations wouldmake "racist language or behaviour" criminal and would allow racial attacks tobe defined by the victim not the police (if the victim says they're racist,they are).            Despite calls byLawrence's parents for his resignation, the London Metropolitan PoliceCommissioner Sir Paul Condon is staying in office. He conveyed his "sense ofshame" and vowed to make the police into "an anti-racist force." The                  Guardian                stresses the drama and context of the changes:It's the first major anti-racist legislation in 20 years and will cover "anylong-established, white-dominated organisation which is liable to haveprocedures, practices and a culture which tend to exclude or to disadvantagenon-white people."            The                   London Evening Standard                relays an embarrassing postscript to Straw's announcement:He had to withdraw a thick chunk of the already published report Thursdaybecause it contained the names and addresses of witnesses and informants whoassisted investigators. The paper calls the information "the most sensitivethat could be imagined to be involved in any police investigation" and surmisesthat those mentioned could already be in danger. The Standard alsoreports that hours after the report was published, amemorial to Lawrence was defaced with paint. The vandals were not caughtbecause a security camera trained on the memorial was not loaded withvideotape.            European papers keep atroubled eye on yet more avalanches in the Alps and the rescue attempts theyare delaying. Just as rescuers were digging out victims of Tuesday's avalanchein Austria, another hit Wednesday, decimating four buildings. The death toll isstill climbing, but all agree that this is the worst avalanche season ingenerations. The Swiss paper                   Neue Zrcher Zeitung                nervously watches smaller, and sofar nonlethal, avalanches in the Swiss neck of the mountains. Most of theaccounts are morose, but a British writer in the Times opines that theAlps are exacting revenge on greedy tourists for exploiting their naturalbeauty.            In Middle Eastern news, fresh ripples and rumors aboutYasser Arafat's future plans: Toronto's                   Globe and Mail               reports that Arafat appears to have dismissed FaisalHusseini, the Palestinian official responsible for Jerusalem affairs and, untilnow, a name high on his list of potential successors. Husseini denies that he'sbeen ousted, but Arafat has already cut off his funding and handed hisportfolio to another minister. The paper mentions "disputes" between Arafat andHusseini but gives no specific reason for his dismissal. The Jordan Timesquotes Arafat as saying that his successor will be chosen by the Palestinianpeople in an election.            Meanwhile, the Egyptianpaper Al-Ahram reports that Arafat is giving new consideration tothe prospect of an official Palestinian-Jordanian confederation. Given therecent transfer of power in Jordan, the upcoming Israeli elections, and hisself-imposed May 4 deadline for declaring a Palestinian state, the link withJordan could help Arafat consolidate ever-slippery support among his variousconstituencies, Israel, and the United States.
