                                 Off the Wal-Mart                           USAToday leads with Al Gore's charge in an interview with the paperthat as president Bill Bradley would endanger the economic expansion and risk"blundering into another recession" because he would take the entire projectedsurplus over the next 10 years and "just blow it" on health-care reform. Thepaper has a Bradley spokeswoman saying Gore's charge makes it obvious he lacksconfidence in his own agenda. The Washington Post also fronts campaign jousting by the twobut goes instead with a momentous Labor Department decision: Companies thatallow employees to work at home will be held responsible for federal health andsafety violations that occur at the home work site. The stance, explains thePost , would mean that even if the employee just occasionally takes workhome with him to attend to a sick child, employers are still required to makesure that he/she has ergonomically correct furniture and proper lighting andventilation in the home office. The Los AngelesTimes fronts the Post story, adding in details about Californiacompanies, but leads with the onset in West Virginia of the U.S.-moderatedIsrael-Syria talks, which is also the New York Times lead and which isfronted elsewhere. The same picture of President Clinton, Israeli PrimeMinister Ehud Barak, and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara walking togethergrace all the fronts that carry photos.            Both Times report that the meetings hit a snag quickly when ananticipated face-to-face between Barak and Shara didn't come off. Both alsoreport that Clinton will not attend every session but will be available toreturn whenever circumstances warrant. So serious are the Israelis aboutbreaking with their past tendencies to leak at such talks, say the papers, thatthey've promised to eschew cell phone calls.            The LAT and WP fronts and the others report inside that actingRussian President Vladimir Putin has fired Boris Yeltsin's daughter from hersenior Kremlin adviser's post. The LAT and WP treat the move asonly cosmetic, with the daughter and her tight little circle of Kremlinadvisers known as the "Family" retaining the power over Putin widely thought tohave brought him into his present circumstance. Indeed, the LAT andNYT s quote Mikhail Gorbachev from an interview in an Italian papersaying that Yeltsin did not want to resign but was pushed out by a trio of thisinner circle including his daughter.            The USAT "Money" front reports an apparent consequence of not muchbang for the TV advertising bucks spent by dot-coms over the Christmas holiday:Dot-com advertisers are starting to bail out of Super Bowl ad placements. Intothe breach, says the paper, may step Microsoft, which has never advertisedduring the big game.            The WP runs a story inside about how Italy is thrilled that it came through Y2K unscathed eventhough it was probably one of the last developed countries to take the problemseriously. But the story doesn't prove that doing nothing was the way to go;actually, it explains that Italy took quite a few precautions, but almost allat the very last minute. So further reporting on Italy's Y2K experience is notlikely to show that preparedness was a waste but rather perhaps that theoptimal strategy included a healthy dose of procrastination.            An AP dispatch in the WP and the LAT 's lead editorialdefending the Y2K preparedness effort both mention a great feel-good solutionfor anybody who went a touch too wacknoid with the tuna and Spam inventories:Give it to places that feed the poor. Today's Papers doesn't ask much from itsreaders, but is asking now: Please do this.            With the economy at full throttle, it would be easy to forget that noteverybody has been able to make the trip. Thank goodness the Wall StreetJournal helps remember the neediest. Today's Journal front recountsthe sad saga of a onetime $400,000-a-year NBC vice president, who risked itall--his five bedroom house in Greenwich, his kids' private schools, his tripsto London--to join an Internet startup. But he found himself under a moredemanding boss than he was used to and got fired before he got a chance toexercise any stock options. To economize, he had to cancel his family's annualvacation and his son's guitar lessons. He's now working for an internet outfitfor $175,000 a year plus stock options.            The LAT business front reports that when Wal-Mart re-launched its Website over the weekend, it found it had inadvertently featured somethingnew--sex books. As a result of downloading a database of titles from athird-party supplier, America's biggest retailer was suddenly able to offerThe Best of Gay Adult Videos (got 'em) and the Couple's Guide tothe Best Erotic Videos (need 'em).
