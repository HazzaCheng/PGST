                                 Not a Denny Less            The Washington Post , Los AngelesTimes , and New York Times leadwith a story that's been cooking for days: passage of a $792 billion tax cut bythe House of Representatives. The bill would pare personal income tax rates by10 percent over the next 10 years, reduce the "marriage penalty" and thehighest rate on capital gains from 20 percent to 15 percent, and repeal the taxon health insurance and large inheritances. The papers concur that the plan haszilch chance of actually becoming law--President Clinton has already promisednot to sign it--and that it merely represents an opening gambit in the upcomingback-and-forth over what to do with the surplus.            The reports agree that this a key victory for House Speaker Denny Hastert,who cajoled his fractious and narrow majority--including a cadre of moderatesskittish about using so much of the surplus for tax cuts--into supporting thelegislation. Hastert wooed party moderates by agreeing to postpone the tax cutif the government's interest rate on the national debt climbs (the papers callthis stipulation a sham; no one understands how it would actually work, and itis unlikely to survive in the Senate). The WP 's ticktock account ofHastert's vote campaign proposes that the bill ultimately passed because "justabout every Republican wants Hastert to succeed." After the bill scored enoughvotes to win, GOP members cheered, "Coach! Coach! Coach!"            The Wall StreetJournal 's "Washington Wire" column ticks off the legislation's manyconcessions to special interest groups. Investmentmeister Warren Buffettpersuaded Sen. Bob Kerrey to up the limit on how many bequeathed publiclytraded shares a private foundation can own in a single company, while Rep.Jennifer Dunn worked on behalf of retail outlets to ensure that theirincentives to build in shopping malls wouldn't be taxed heavily.            All papers front the Chinese government's ban of the spiritual organizationFalun Gong (sometimes known as Falun Dafa). Followers are, says the NYT ,largely "middle-aged people who practice a form of Chinese breathing exercisesand meditation," but they are organized enough to engineer what theWSJ calls "the largest expression of public discontent with thegovernment since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests." The NYT waitsuntil the 22nd paragraph of its story to explain why Beijing is so spooked bythe mystics: Similar groups destabilized the last imperial dynasty, and Chinafears that Falun Gong could organize China's huge numbers of newly laid-offstate employees. The WSJ points out that Falun Gong's estimated 40million members make it a close second in membership to the Chinese CommunistParty's 55 million.            The other unanimously fronted story is the House's denial of funding for theAir Force's super-pricey F-22 fighters, already being prepped for production ata Lockheed Martin warehouse. Each plane cost $200 million, and Lockheed Martinis reeling from the loss of the sale. The WP attributes the decision tocost worries, as well as tension between the White House and Capitol Hill onall matters military.            A NYT front-pager and a WP inside piece report on George W.Bush's first significant policy speech, which laid out a scheme to fund socialservices through private charity. Bush proposed spending $8 billion--or, as theWP reminds, 10 percent of the non-Social Security budget surplus-on taxincentives designed to stimulate contributions to nonprofits and religiousgroups. The WP calls Bush's proposals the first real glimpse of the faceof "compassionate conservatism" and an unmistakable rejection of Republican"free-market libertarian orthodoxy." His programs surely would work if othercitizens are as generous as his supporters: Despite his speaking in ground zeroof Quayle territory, Bush carted home a one-night haul of at least$600,000.            The WSJ reports that despite Al Gore's avid technophilia, BillBradley is outpacing him in Silicon Valley contributors, with George W. Bush aclose second. High-tech titans admire Bradley's nuanced grasp of financialesoterica and support for free trade. Meanwhile, Gore's stock suffers from histight associations with tort lawyers, who often bring stockholder suits againststartups when their stock tanks.            Need a mate? A WSJ piece quotes friendly-sounding singles ads,complete with descriptions like "Looking for a playmate?" "full of energy andspunk," and "a real ladies man." But don't respond unless you're ready to getdown on four legs; the ads feature dogs in need of a home.
