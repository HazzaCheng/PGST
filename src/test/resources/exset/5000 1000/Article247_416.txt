                                 IRS: We Bite Too            The IRS firestorm leads at USA Today , the New York Times ,and the Los Angeles Times . At the Washington Post , the lead national story is PresidentClinton's appearance at ceremonies commemorating the 40th anniversary of theforced integration of Central High in Little Rock.            President Clinton used the occasion to issue a warning about the trendtoward the re-separation of the races, a trend both the WP andNYT had no trouble observing at Central High, where the dining areas andacademic tracks are largely de facto segregated. And both papers noted that thelocal chapter of the NAACP voted not to support or participate in theceremonies. More heartening was the revelation in both papers that a whitewoman famously captured in a 1957 photograph cursing the entering blackstudents was present to publicly apologize for her long-ago actions. (Justwondering: Couldn't they also have found one of the paratroopers who escortedthe students?)            The NYT Little Rock coverage includes a nice little survey of thenine original black students and what they're doing today. The list includes aninvestment banker, a writer, a lawyer, a college professor, and an unemployedwoman. Two of the nine live overseas. The LAT has a nice photo on itsfront top of Clinton with some of the nine, but runs the story inside.            The LAT and USAT continue pressing on the IRS story, withleads describing yesterday's testimony, in which a number of current agents,speaking from behind a screen, their voices electronically altered, blew thewhistle on the agency's shady practices; and in which the acting commissioner,Michael Dolan, continued to apologize and pledge reform. After ignoring the IRSstory yesterday, the NYT plays catch-up today. Surprisingly, theWP sticks the story way inside.            The LAT breaks the story that former senior White House aide HaroldIckes has this week told federal investigators that he was in the same room atthe White House with President Clinton when Clinton made telephone fund pitchesto several Democratic contributors during the run-up to the 1994 elections.This is the first corroboration of the claim that Clinton personally solicitedmoney from inside the White House.            The NYT front page states that Newt Gingrich has ruled out any chancethe House will pass the major campaign-reform bill banning all soft money thathas been advancing in the Senate. Gingrich favors instead lifting all limits onpolitical contributions.            The Wall Street Journal 's "Washington Wire" reports that theprobe into the fund-raising behind the election of Ron Carey as president ofthe Teamsters could, because some DNC officials allegedly are involved, resultin the appointment of yet another independent counsel.            At first, the NYT didn't even mention the Marv Albert trial, thendealt with it deep inside and at arm's length. (Yesterday's Times editof the AP story about the second woman's testimony didn't mention, for example,that she said Albert was wearing women's clothes.) But today, with theresolution of the case, the Gray Lady hikes her skirts, putting the story onthe front page and deigning to mention all the tawdry details. The story isalso on the front of the LAT , alongside a picture of Albert that makeshim look downright scary, and is the second lead at USAT .            The WP , which was much more aggressive from the git-go, simply raisesthe ante today, with not just a long front-page piece but also not one, but twoadditional Albert pieces elsewhere in the paper, one a ramble wondering ifAlbert can rebound professionally, the other a thumb-sucker about women whostand by their man when he's in trouble. In the Post 's main Albertpiece, the accuser is never mentioned by name, a practice the paper explainsthus: "The Washington Post does not identify victims of alleged sexualattacks." But it turns out that the paper isn't able to stick to that policyfor more than a few paragraphs. A little further down, the paper identifies byname the second woman who testified that she, too, was bitten and sexuallyassaulted by Albert. So what's the actual policy, Post ?
