                                 Belgrade Gets the Baghdad Treatment            The lead story at mostpapers is that NATO has decided to begin bombing a wider range of governmentbuildings, including some in downtown Belgrade. The Times of London runs theheadline "Belgrade to get the 'Baghdad treatment.' " An editorial argues thatairstrikes have been (and will continue to be) more effective at destroying theSerbian military than most people think. Nevertheless, the article concludes,if the strikes don't stop the atrocities in Kosovo within a "few days," groundtroops should be sent in. Another editorial urges the United Kingdom to donatehumanitarian supplies and eventually grant immigration visas to "our share" ofthe refugees.            The Independent of Londonhas posted a reporter on the border between Macedonia and Kosovo tointerview the incoming flood of refugees. He writes:                           The stories are too horrific to tell indetail. I heard of murder, rape, looting, and persistent abuse--by rifle-buttand boot. I heard of several hundred people hiding in a cave that once formedan old marble quarry, being taunted from outside by men firing machine-pistolvolleys into the air. ...                                       There were a dozen, almost identicalaccounts of the operational technique of ethnic cleansing. First the roar oftanks coming down the valleys, then the sound of whistles being blown and thefiring of automatic weapons, as the villages and hamlets that dot southernKosovo ... are surrounded by regular soldiers who order the people tomove.                                       Then come the hard men, often masked, whoseparate the important ones from the peasants. The peasants are forced south,taking only what they can carry, where they must brave further "checkpoints" inthe form of armed robbers, before they reach the border. The "important ones"stay behind.                        The angry reportercomplains that in the Macedonian capital, 15 miles away, NATO swells are eating"steak au poivre ... washed down with the fiery Macedonian wine." Meanwhile, nointernational agency has bothered to set up aid stations at the border todistribute hot porridge or first aid to the dehydrated and hypothermicrefugees.            Most papers mention that three American servicemen werebeen captured by Serbian forces, though there are few details. The UnitedStates claims the men were in Macedonia when arrested; the Serbians say theyhad crossed the border into Serbia. A picture of the men--one with a badlybruised face--was displayed on Serbian TV and reproduced in newspapers aroundthe world.            An article in theMoscow Timesreports that Russia has sent a warship to the Mediterranean and is prepared tosend six more. President Boris Yeltsin has promised not to intervene militarilyin the Kosovo situation. Nevertheless, commenting on the ship movements,Yeltsin's defense minister ominously said, "The Defense Ministry is alsoconsidering more decisive actions that will be recommended to the leadership ifthe situation changes." Another article says that foreigners from NATOcountries are feeling increasingly unsafe in Russia. The U.S. Embassy has beenattacked, the windows of a restaurant called Uncle Sam's Caf were smashed, andthe U.S. Consulate in St. Petersburg urges Americans not to speak English tooloudly on the street. The article interviews many Westerners who feelthreatened, but none has been physically injured.            The Irish Times reports "speculation" that NATO is thinking about creating a"safe haven" in Kosovo. The area would be secured by ground troops. Amazingly,the article doesn't say who exactly is doing the "speculating." The news pegfor the article is a visit to the Albania-Kosovo border by NATO's deputycommander.            But the big news in Ireland is the peacenegotiations between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime MinisterBertie Ahern. The latest news is that, after four days of negotiations, the twosides failed to agree on when the Irish Republican Army must disarm. Protestantleaders are refusing to share power with the IRA in Northern Ireland until theIRA disarms. IRA leaders want to create the coalition government beforedisarming. Talks will resume April 13.                           Most Boring HeadlineEver? "Capital Legislator Want More Facts on Daylight Savings Time" fromMexico's News .
