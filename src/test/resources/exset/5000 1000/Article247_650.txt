                                 Dress Rehearsal            The expected grand jury testimony today of Monica Lewinsky leads at USA Today andgets subhead billing in the Washington Post 's lead, which is about the Clintonadministration's revival of the claim of executive privilege in the Lewinskymatter. The New York Timesplays Monica's imminent testimony below the fold (as does the Los AngelesTimes ), leading instead with the Iraqis' umpteenth snit over U.N.weapons inspections, which is the LAT 's top national story, and whichalso gets top front placement at USAT . (But doesn't make the Postfront.)            The USAT lead states that Lewinsky is prepared to testify that sheand President Clinton had a sexual relationship and that although she was neverdirectly told to lie under oath about it, she was given suggestions it shouldbe kept secret. And "prepared" here, the paper specifies, means that Lewinskyspent Wednesday going through a "final rehearsal" of her testimony with KenStarr's people. USAT somehow refrains from calling it a "dress"rehearsal. Spending the day this way raises a question not addressed in any ofthe coverage to date: How come it's ok for lawyers to do all these dry runs?Isn't this just coaching the witness? The Nation's Newspaper makes the niftyobservation that yesterday marked the beginning of Starr's fifth year ofinvestigating Clinton.            The NYT oversells its Iraq lead in saying that the latest developments mark "the firsttime" Saddam Hussein said he was ending all cooperation with U.N. inspectors.Especially since just a few paragraphs in, the story quotes chief inspectorRichard Butler as saying "...there is a syndrome here--going around the sametrack again and again." And a little further below that, it quotes a NationalSecurity Council spokesman saying, "We've heard this bluster before."            Now that Clinton staff attorney Lanny Breuer is invoking executive privilegeto keep from having a Starr grand jury sit-down, the WP usefullydocuments the White House's legal tacking by quoting White House counselCharles Ruff's comments from two months ago: "We have no intention of assertingthe privilege, executive privilege, in any situation that I'm aware of."            The LAT 's "Column One" says that Steven Spielberg's "Saving PrivateRyan" ends years of silence about the horrors experienced by American soldiersin World War II. Last week, USAT ran a big front-page piece saying thesame thing. But what of Joseph Heller's Catch 22 , Kurt Vonnegut'sSlaughterhouse Five , Paul Fussell's Wartime and DoingBattle , or Ronald Reagan's (Peggy Noonan's) 1984 "Boys of Pointe du Hoc"speech? Isn't this just another annoying example of Boomers mistakenly thinkingthey discovered, nay, invented, something that's been around for quite a while?(You know, like having children and working hard.)            The LAT follows up its front-page scoop that World War II washorrible with its front-page David Shaw scoop that as internet and cable newsoutlets proliferate, the pressure to be first is, in the quoted words of DanRather, "greater and stronger." Other talking heads brought on board includeBill Kovach, the "Curator of Neiman Fellowships in Journalism at HarvardUniversity" (point: working fast leads to mistakes) and Marvin Kalb, "executivedirector of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and PublicPolicy" (point: being first is profitable). When was the last time Shaw did apiece that didn't quote all these media mafiosi? And would it be too much toask that their ideas be more substantial than their job titles?            The Wall Street Journal reports that Golden Books, off ofdisastrous first-half results, has hired a media investment banker to explore"strategic opportunities." It's not just that Toys "R" Us isn't stocking asmany books as it used to--hey, there's also the Shari Lewis death to contendwith.            One of the bigger challenges faced by contemporary journalism isconvincingly dressing up its desire to dig dirt in the clothes of someprinciple or other. Consider the WP 's editorial on Monica's imminent grand jury appearance, whichstates that her testimony "offers a welcome opportunity to turn thisinvestigation away from the fascinating but tangential privilege questionsabout Secret Service agents and White House lawyers in which it has so longbeen mired. It is a chance to get back to the core issues Mr. Starr was askedto address." Fascinating privilege questions? Core issues Mr. Starr was askedto address? Yeah, right.
