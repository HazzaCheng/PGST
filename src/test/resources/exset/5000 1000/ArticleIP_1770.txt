While papers across theworld led Thursday with apocalyptic headlines about the collapse of Russia,none were more apocalyptic than those in Russia's own press. Izvestiya warned that theaddition of a political crisis to the existing economic crisis might result in"a revolutionary situation." The possibility that the country might be leftwithout legislative power for the next three months is "fraught with the mostdangerous consequences--including the disintegration of the state," itsaid.                           Segodnya reportedthat Dagestan is on the edge of civil war and that the halting of ruble-dollartrading on the financial markets means that Russia is facing the threat of areturn to a fixed ruble-dollar exchange rate, as in Soviet times.            Nezavisimaya Gazeta saidthat Russia could be facing hyperinflation, as in 1992, and that the country'sgeneral situation is rapidly approaching the critical point: It facessimultaneous financial, industrial, social, and political meltdowns; it mustalso deal with the fighting already taking place in the Northern Caucasus, andwith the danger of Afghan military action on its southern border.            Wednesday's Russian papers concentrated on thereappointment of Victor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. Izvestiya saidthat, with this, President Boris Yeltsin has effectively given up power andNovye Izvestiya that his second coming is attributable not to anyfailings by Chernomyrdin's predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, but to Yeltsin'sdecision not to seek re-election in 2000.            In Rome,La Repubblica said ina front-page comment by Sandro Viola that "seldom in history has a countryreceived from the same person so many reasons for hope and then so manyafflictions as ... Russia with Boris Yeltsin."            Under the headline "Stop This BloodyTerrorism," the Cape Times of Cape Town, South Africa, condemnedTuesday's bomb blast at the Planet Hollywood restaurant as "cold-blooded,mindless, unjustifiable terrorism" going to "the heart of the tensions in ourtroubled society." Making no reference to the United States or to thepossibility that the attack might have been a reprisal for U.S. missile attacksin Sudan and Afghanistan, it blamed terrorists who "want our communities toremain divided." It urged people to "use this opportunity to recommit ourselvesto a united city and isolate all those who have different and sinisterintentions."            In an editorialThursday, the Pakistani newspaper Dawn warned that Pakistan's economic crisis will reach "a pointof no return" by mid-September failing a miracle. It proposed stoppingnegotiations for a bailout package with the Islamic Development Bank--withwhich "it is not Islamic fraternal feeling, as some of us would like naively tobelieve, but pure profit motive which seems to have weighed." Instead, itadvocated a closer look at a prospective International Monetary Fund package,even though "[o]f course, an IMF programme would bring massive hardships forthe common people."            InCanada, the Toronto Staraccused Britain and the Irish Republic of riding roughshod over civil libertiesin the new laws they are drafting to make it easier for the police and courtsto convict suspected terrorists. Referring in an editorial Thursday to the "firestorm of anger and revulsion" thathad followed the recent bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland, the paper said thatthis "new crackdown, so late in the day, smacks of over-reaction." Itconcluded, "Civil liberties, once eroded, are not easily regained." TheIrish News of Belfastled its front page Thursday with the news that President Clinton will meet morethan 100 members of the new Northern Ireland assembly next Thursday. He willalso visit Omagh.
