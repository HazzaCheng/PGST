                                 Killing Them Softly            Wednesday, several Iraqifighter jets zipped into the "no-fly" zone over southern Iraq, encountered U.S.and British warplanes, and sped away without firing. Rather than pursue theoffenders, the allied U.S. and British pilots rained bombs and missiles onunrelated Iraqi radar, missile, and communications facilities. This was thelatest chapter in a seven week assault on Iraq's air defenses that has earnedscant media coverage and no outcries in Congress or at the United Nations,thanks to an ingenious U.S. public relations strategy of spontaneity,self-defense, and silence.            Last December, when theUnited States and Britain bombed Iraq for four days, television networkscovered the onslaught live. Governments around the world cringed, manyprotested, and the bombing had to be halted. Since then, Saddam Hussein hasrepeatedly defied the no-fly zones, using his jets, radar, and anti-aircraftweapons to provoke allied pilots. The conventional wisdom, distilled last weekby the Los Angeles Times , is that Saddam is shrewdly provoking theallies and that they're taking the bait, engaging in a "war of attrition" thatwill "keep world attention focused" on Iraq and leave the United States"looking like a bully."            But over the past month and a half, the United States haslearned how to wage war under the guise of ad hoc retaliation. PresidentClinton authorized pilots to attack air defense sites unrelated to those thathave threatened their planes. Gen. Anthony Zinni, who commands U.S. forces inIraq, told Congress, "We have the authority to react and attack any part of theair defense system any time there's a threat. And it's not particularly gearedto the cause of the threat." U.S. officials indicate that pilots patrolling theno-fly zones deliberately pass over predetermined targets, obviously in thehope that the Iraqis will provoke them. In late January, for example, theallies noticed that Iraq had moved three anti-ship missile launchers toward thePersian Gulf. Only after a separate Iraqi battery fired on allied patrol planeson Feb. 2 did the United States drop a dozen bombs on the anti-ship launchers,destroying two of them.            In short, the allies arebeating Saddam at his own game of provocation. "He's provided an opportunityfor us to pick apart his military machine," one U.S. official explained to theLos Angeles Times . In January alone, allied aircraft patrolling theno-fly zones dropped some 60 bombs and missiles on Saddam's air defenses,scoring more hits than they achieved in December's four day campaign. Onbackground, the Clinton administration admits that its aim is to destroySaddam's air defenses, demoralize his generals, and provoke a coup. He islosing the war of attrition.            Meanwhile, the world isn't paying attention. Wednesday'sbombing made Page A5 of the New York Times and Page A33 of theWashington Post (as a wire story). Congressional critics and Arabgovernments are silent. The U.N. Security Council is ignoring Iraq's protests.That's largely because, in contrast to the overhyped December bombardment, U.S.officials are playing down the recent assaults, justifying them in terms ofself-defense and providing scant information on the damage. "We are respondingin a comprehensive way when [Iraq] threatens our pilots," National SecurityCouncil spokesman P.J. Crowley told the Post . Meanwhile, officialsanonymously concede that the piecemeal retaliatory strategy is designed tomollify Arab and European leaders. One senior official told the Post ,"It's a way of pursuing an objective in a way that everyone's comfortable with.You get things done without rocking any boats. If we started a broad bombingcampaign people would say, 'What provoked this?' "            None of this impliesthat the bombing raids are unjustified. There is broad international agreementthat Saddam is a menace and scofflaw. Furthermore, he can always moot theallies' self-defense argument by ceasing his provocations. But evidently he'stoo dumb and stubborn to restrain himself. Meanwhile, a White House thatcouldn't resist staging a pep rally for its impeached president has remainedscrupulously gloat-free about its military success in Iraq. Sometimes the bestspin is no spin at all.
