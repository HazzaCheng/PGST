                                 Changing Tallulah            Hereis how we spend the first half-hour of every day in Paris:            Eachmorning between 7 and 7:30, Tallulah begins to sing. She's only 8 months old,so she doesn't know any words. Still, she sounds as if she is practicing herscales. I crawl out of bed and tumble downstairs to turn on the heat, rigged bythe French handyman so that it cannot run for more than about 12 hours on endwithout busting. I then clean up the mess invariably left by Vegas on thekitchen floor--one of several evil new tricks she has picked up from the localdogs--and toss her out into the garden. For a minute or so I watch through thewindow to make sure she doesn't get any ideas about the Camembert. Like Frenchpeople, we now keep our smelly cheeses in planting pots outside. Imprisoned inthe refrigerator, the Camembert still had the power to stink up the entirehouse. I'd open the door to grab a cold drink and be driven backwards by theodor; a minute later, whoever was on the third floor would shout in panickytones, "Shut the fridge! Shut the fridge!" Relations with the cheese hadreached the point where one of us had to go.            OnceVegas is past the Camembert, I turn and race upstairs to snatch Tallulah fromher crib before she stops singing and becomes outraged. Coming up the stairs, Ising "Old McDonald Had a Farm." On his farm he had a rooster, I assume."Cock-a-doodle-do" is the signal for Tallulah to reach out with her arms and belifted from her crib. Rising, she smiles and kicks her feet as if somethingreally great is about to happen. I try not to disappoint. Together, we draw thecurtains on the third-floor windows and peer up at the back of the crepuscularneighboring apartment building to see if any French people are doing anythingparticularly French. They are: sleeping. This is a nation of vampires; ourstreets are empty each morning until nearly 10:00. "Coo," Tallulah says, aftera minute of staring at the old building, then swivels and tosses her warmlittle arms around me in her version of a bear hug.            As wemove to the changing table the mood shifts. The moment she is laid on her back,Tallulah loses her love for me and becomes as impatient as a race-car driverwaiting for the tires to be changed. To keep her still enough to be unwrapped,cleaned, and then wrapped again, I must find ever more exotic ways to trick herinto thinking something worth paying attention to is about to happen, righthere, in her own bedroom. She never falls for the same trick twice. Thismorning, for instance, I danced the Parisian Trash Bag Dance--a performance shewatched less with amusement than with a kind of morbid fascination. TheParisian Trash Bag Dance involves grabbing one of the giant blue trash bagsthey sell at the local market and swishing it back and forth over my headalluringly, while swaying my hips, like Salom charming Herod. Once Tallulah ismesmerized, I am able to remove one hand from the bag and do the dirty work,dancing all the while. A moment's pause in the entertainment and she's flippingherself onto her stomach, in a suicidal attempt to vault sideways off thechanging table.            Thediaper changed, I grab Tallulah, put her under my arm like a football, duckbeneath the low staircase ceiling, and plunge down the narrow, unbelievablysteep stairs to our bedroom. There, mother sleeps. There, for Tallulah, isbliss. She raises her arms and cheers and kicks up such a delighted fuss that Iam reminded all over again what a dull pleasure I am to my own child. I am thewarm-up act. The featured attraction, inured to her own importance, reaches upfrom under her covers and drags Tallulah under the covers.            Sadly, there is hardly amoment to spare on self-pity. By now there is the most unbelievable ruckuscoming from outside. The dog, somehow already possessed of a French dog's senseof her rights, is busy breaking down the door with her head. Sometimes, forfun, I open it just as she is about to strike again and she goes flying acrossthe kitchen floor like a vaudeville comedian in a skit, crashing into theopposite wall.
