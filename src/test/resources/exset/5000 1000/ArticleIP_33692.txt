Rathergrim reports for Hugh Grant's latest smirking, stuttering performance as anupper-crusty Brit. This time around, he gets mixed up in the mob family of hisfiancee (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Yes, Grant's cute, but the movie's a stinker,"little more than a series of stitched together gags" (Stephen Holden, theNew York Times ). Reviewers disagree about whose fault it is. TheChicago Sun-Times ' Roger Ebert says the scenes where Grant learns totalk like a gangster are "so badly handled by Grant that the movie derails andnever recovers." The Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan, on the otherhand, argues that Grant "goes a long way toward saving [the film] from itself."(Click to read the review by                   Slate               's David Edelstein.Visit the official site to see stills and clips from thefilm.)

The results are disastrous. The plot? Students take revenge on asadistic teacher. (The film was originally called Killing Mrs. Tingle ,but the title was toned down in the wake of recent school violence.) The film"bludgeons the audience with broad, crude, creepy developments" (Ebert, theChicago Sun-Times ) and lacks Williamson's usual humor and panache. HelenMirren, playing the evil Mrs. Tingle, rises above the weak material--which onlymakes the film "even more painful" to watch (Desson Howe, the WashingtonPost ). One critic dissents: Kevin Thomas, the Los Angeles Times 'always easy-to-please critic, flouts conventional wisdom and calls the film a"knockout directorial debut."

Books                                                         The                   Jukebox Queen of                   Malta               ,by NicholasRinaldi (Simon & Schuster). Critics enjoy this love story about a youngradio operator from Brooklyn and a local jukebox repairwoman who meet in Maltaduring the bombings of World War II. Richard Bernstein praises the novel as "afunny, melancholy, romantic, disturbing, character-rich window on the war" (theNew York Times ). But others complain that "the influences of JosephHeller's classic Catch-22 and Louis de Bernires' recent Corelli'sMandolin are rather too blatantly present" and make the novel feel overlyfamiliar. Still, "if Heller hadn't existed we might be calling this a prettyterrific novel" ( Kirkus Reviews ). (Click here to read the first chapter.)

Critics are intrigued by the dramatic story of successful19 th -century gynecological surgeon Mary Amanda Dixon Jones, whosecareer was derailed by a smear campaign. Unfortunately, Morantz-Sanchezrecounts the tale "in academic prose thick enough to thwart all but the mostpersistent" ( Kirkus Reviews ). Bernstein of the New York Timesagrees, complaining that "Ms. Morantz-Sanchez is more interested in thescholarly value of her story than its inherent drama and that will make thebook tough going for some readers." But most say the interesting sociologicalhistory and insight into attitudes about women in medicine make it worth theslog. (Click here to read the first chapter.)

Critics groan at Jean-Claude Van Damme's sequel to the 1992 actionflick about reanimated dead soldiers. It's all "bullets, bombs, and boobs--thebiggest boob being Van Damme, natch" (Rod Dreher, the New York Post ).But "for those eager to bid adieu to their credibility for 82 minutes," atleast the action "rarely flags" (Lawrence Van Gelder, the New YorkTimes ).
