                                 Eruption Over E-Voting in Arizona            It'stoo early to know whether Bill Bradley or Al Gore will win the ArizonaDemocratic Party primary on March 11, 2000. But if the election goes accordingto plan, almost every voter in the primary will make worldwide history bycasting a ballot over the Internet.            Thismonth, the party agreed to become the first political organization anywhere onthe globe to hold a legally binding election over the Internet. And whethervoting from home or a local schoolhouse, most of Arizona's anticipated 20,000to 40,000 voters will use the Net to vote.            Thedevelopment disturbs some voter education groups. At least one is consideringlegal action to stop the primary. "I'm very troubled that a public election isgoing to occur with an untried, unproven technology," said Deborah Philips, whostudies online voting issues for the Voting Integrity Project. Philips saidthat she has spoken to Washington-based election law attorney M. Miller Bakerabout pursuing legal responses to the party's decision to use Net voting.            Bakerconfirmed that he is "looking at" the possibility of suing the Arizona party."We have grave doubts whether an election by this method would comport withminimal constitutional requirements for a fraud-free election."            Regardless of whether a lawsuit is filed, Arizona's planned primarydemonstrates that online voting has moved rapidly from a controversial theoryto a real business. According to one estimate, there are over half a millionpublic elections in the United States every year. That creates a potentialmultimillion-dollar market for companies providing voting services.            Arizona Democratic Party officials have hired Votation.com, a Garden City, Long Island-based firm whichis less than a year old. In a separate announcement, Votation.com alsodisclosed this week that it has received a minority equity investment fromVeriSign, the publicly traded digital certification firm based in MountainView, Calif.            Neither the officials nor Votation.com would provide a figure for how much theservice costs, although Votation.com President Mel Schrieberg, who has handledmany elections for labor unions and nonprofit groups, says that organizationsusing it "save substantially on postage and paper."            Indeed, the Arizona Democratic Party will use Internet ballots not just forremote voters, but even at polling places. "We'll have paper ballots [atpolling places] for those who are afraid to use the Net, mostly because ofunfamiliarity," says Arizona state party chairman Mark Fleisher. "But I wouldguess that 95 percent of the ballots cast statewide will be over theInternet."            RemoteInternet voters will, like those using absentee ballots, have a slightly widervoting window than those going to physical locations. The Net "polls" will beopen from 12:01 a.m. on Friday, March 10, until 7:01 p.m., Saturday, March 11,when the physical polling booths will close as well.            Boththe state party and Votation.com downplay any concerns about potential voterfraud. According to the company, voters will be able to verify their identityusing their date of birth and a digital signature. Critics point out, however,that neither the Federal Election Commission nor the state of Arizona hascertified any standards for Internet voting.            Although Arizona Democratswould probably be the largest group affected by any potential Net voting fraudor security breach, the campaigns for Bill Bradley and Al Gore would alsopresumably be affected. If, however, the Gore campaign is worried, they're notsaying so publicly. "We view anything that helps expand participation in theelectoral process as a positive development," says Ben Green, director ofInternet operations, Gore 2000. The Bradley campaign declined to provide acomment for this story.
