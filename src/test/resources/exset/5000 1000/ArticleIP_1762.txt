Taking up a cause recentlypromoted by its Canadian proprietor Conrad Black, the conservative BritishDaily Telegraph (circulation 1 million) argued Britain should apply for membership--or associatemembership--in the North American Free Trade Agreement. It said in an editorialMonday that Black's proposal was supported not only by Margaret Thatcher,several leading members of the opposition Conservative Party, and Britain'slargest circulation newspaper (Rupert Murdoch's Sun ) but also by HouseSpeaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.            Thenotion that the United States wants Britain to remain part of a European blocis "becoming out of date," the paper said. "US commentators are waking up tothe fact that the [European Union] contains an important anti-Americancomponent. Henry Kissinger, perhaps the most influential of post-war foreignpolicy thinkers, recently warned against further European integration." TheTelegraph said the case for "associating with the New World" doesn'trest simply on an affinity of culture, language, or political values but isbased on hard economic calculation.            Black's Israeli newspaper, the Jerusalem Post, congratulated Jordan's ailing King Hussein Monday on the factthat the longevity of his rule--46 years next month--"has been achieved mainlythrough consensual rule rather than despotism." The paper's editorial recalledAmerican journalist Walter Lippmann on the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt--"thegenius of a good leader is to leave behind him a situation which common sense,without the grace of genius, can deal with successfully"--and suggested Husseinhas achieved this.            India'sAsian Age led its front page Monday with the news that India plans tocash in on the Viagra craze by exporting its essential chemical ingredient tocountries not yet covered by Pfizer's patent. In a report from Chennai(Madras), the paper said Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals plans to startexporting sildenafil citrate, the active ingredient in Viagra, to countries inSouth America and eastern Europe at the end of August. Orchid has had tradeinquiries from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh; it has the necessarylicenses from the Indian government to manufacture and export the chemical andhas already started importing the raw materials.            In an editorial about a U.S. decision tosuspend all scientific collaboration with India and to send several Indianscientists home, the Asian Age said "few scientists from the erstwhileSoviet Union faced such treatment as has been meted out to Indian scientistsnow, even at the height of the Cold War." If the United States continues tobehave like an international bully, "the result will certainly not be greaterpeace and cohesion in the world: that much is for sure."            Pakistan's main English-language newspaper, Dawn, focused Monday on the crisis in Kosovo, Yugoslavia. Accusing theUnited States and other Western governments of "inexplicable delay" in checking"Serbia's relentless offensive" against Kosovar Muslims, it warned that if theworld community continues "to waver and dither over what is happening in Kosovofor long," it will find a "Bosnia-like conflict in [its] lap."            The Russian newspaper Segodnya , commenting on VicePresident Al Gore's visit to Russia, said President Boris Yeltsin, vacationingin Karelia, had deliberately distanced himself from Gore because he didn't wantto look as if he was begging for American money. But the daily said this "musthave left an unfavorable impression."            In Japan, Mainichi Shimbuncriticized the new Liberal Democratic Party leader Keizo Obuchifor being "devoid of fresh ideas" for reviving the Japanese economy. "Obuchishould remember that while the Japanese public has an intense desire to see aneconomic upturn, it is not waiting for easy-to-swallow solutions," the papersaid in an editorial. "Even if the measures implemented require painfulsacrifices, people are willing to bear them if they promise a secure andhealthy future."            The Japan Times said Tuesdaythat Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji "may be obliged to reconsider his pledgeto hold steady the value of the currency. That in turn could--most likelywould--trigger another round of devaluations in Asia and set back the region'srecovery." It concluded, "Japan cannot afford to stand idly by: China'sdifficulties make ours look small in comparison."
