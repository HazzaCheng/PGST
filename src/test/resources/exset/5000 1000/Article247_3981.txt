                                 The Folklore of the Antiwar Movement                        Our debate reminds me of that old story about Winston Churchill or GeorgeBernard Shaw or whoever the Brit was who asks a woman if she'd sleep with himfor one million pounds. She is outraged. "How about for 10 pence?" he asks."Just who do you think I am, sir?" "We've already established that," he says."Now we're just haggling over price." In a sense, that's what we're arguingover. We disagree on whether the price of keeping South Vietnam out of NorthVietnam's control was worth paying--or even if there was a price that mighthave been politically acceptable in the United States in the early 1970s.            Let me try to make the case that the price was worth paying. First, look atwhat happened as a result of the American pullout. Critics of U.S. interventionhave never come to grips with this. But a lot of horrible things didhappen. One million boat people, of whom tens of thousands died at sea. Thecreation of a giant gulag in Vietnam that was euphemistically referred to as"re-education camps." I've even heard American journalists defend the camps aslegitimate educational institutions. An oppressive Communist regime over all ofVietnam. And the fall of Cambodia, which fell all the way back to the StoneAge, and Laos, countries that might not have fallen if the United States hadmaintained a relatively small military force in South Vietnam and providedserious amounts of aid to non-Communist leaders. My point is that all this wasa very high price to pay, though it wasn't paid by Americans.            Now, what was the most explosive event of the war in terms of adversereaction at home? Clearly it was the incursion by American troops into Cambodiain 1970. That led to protests all over the country, including the one at KentState in which four students were shot to death by National Guardsmen. But asbad as the eruption was, the Nixon administration weathered it. Anger didn'tvanish, but it did die down. And I think there was still plenty of room forPresident Nixon to maneuver. The trouble was he and Henry Kissinger maneuveredfor the wrong thing. They got a peace settlement that left some NorthVietnamese troops in South Vietnam, but, ultimately, no American troops.            I know that "what-ifs" are pure speculation, but I'm not going to let thatstop me. So, what if Nixon had announced that he would leave a contingent ofAmerican troops in South Vietnam. They wouldn't stay there in a front-linecombat role. That would be left to the South Vietnamese army, much improved bythis point in the war. But the U.S. troops would be there. At the very least, Ibelieve, their presence would have effectively deterred the North Vietnamesefrom an all-out attack. It was such an invasion in 1975--and not anything theViet Cong did--that caused the collapse of South Vietnam. Sure, there wouldhave been protests and teach-ins. Rennie Davis and Dave Dellinger would havebeen mad. But I think fury would have subsided and the new Vietnam policy couldhave been implemented successfully.            O.K., all this is hindsight. But we learn a lot from hindsight. You and Iagree with Mike Lind's destruction of myths about Vietnam, or what he calls"the folklore of the antiwar movement." One of those myths is championed byFredrik Logevall in Choosing War . That's the idea of "missedopportunities" for a peace settlement before the American buildup in 1965. AsLind points out, this myth is a favorite of the left and always pops up inconnection with U.S. relations with a Communist country. It's classicanti-anti-Communist. But would any treaty have stopped Ho Chi Minh, a convincedStalinist, from pursuing his goal of capturing all of Vietnam by any meansnecessary? Of course not. He'd have achieved his goal a lot sooner.            Jim, I'd recommend a different book, one I've mentioned before. It's ABetter War by Lewis Sorley, which explains how the war had been all butwon, militarily, by the end of 1970. It hasn't gotten nearly the attention thatMike Lind's book has, but A Better War deserves strong consideration byanyone still interested in Vietnam. Yes, I was predisposed in favor of hisargument. Still, I think he made it especially well.            As for Nixon, I'm not going to defend him. I've always wondered whether,absent Watergate, he'd have lived up to his promise to President Thieu ofrenewed American military intervention in the case of a North Vietnameseinvasion. I doubt it. But, as you say, that's another story.
