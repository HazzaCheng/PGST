                                                            Ask Not What YouCan Constitutionally Do ...                        I'm not sure I quite see what's odd about acceptinga post that, as an abstract legal matter, you think is unconstitutional (see""). Many people, for instance, believe that all independent agencies (such asthe FCC) are unconstitutional, and that the Supreme Court was mistaken inupholding this "fourth branch of government." Does it really follow that aperson who believes this can't in good conscience go to work for the FCC?            I don't think that such punctilio is really morallyor professionally obligatory. The battle over the constitutionality ofindependent agencies was fought in the courts; it was won by those who'veargued that such agencies are constitutional. For our legal system's purposes,that's that, at least until the court reverses its views. A fair-minded personmight say, "Given that the law as interpreted today authorizes such agencies, Ifeel that I can do good/do my duty to my country by working for thisagency."            Same for the independentcounsel. Now, if one thought that the office was not just unconstitutional butimmoral , that would be a different story; for instance, if one thinksthat it violates basic human rights to outlaw drugs, going to work for the DEAwould be a bit iffy. But I don't think people really think this (or shouldthink this) about the independent counsel statute.            -- EugeneVolokh                        UCLA Law School            LosAngeles                           InflatedInflation                        After referring to the USA Today report thateconomists don't expect rising gasoline prices to trigger inflation, ""concludes with the rhetorical flourish, "Huh--isn't inflation primarilymeasured as a rate of increase in cost?"            Both the economists cited and Scott Shuger seemconfused. Inflation is an overall rise in the price of goods and services. Thekey word is overall . The increase or decrease in any particular item notonly does not, but cannot, produce inflation. When the amount of money incirculation is fixed, if expenditures rise in one area, a fortiori, they fallin another. Inflation, by definition, occurs when the government increases themoney supply faster than the real growth of the economy, because this increaseis the only way more money can become available to chase the same number ofgoods.            A logical corollary is that inflation cannot be"triggered" by increasing wages, farm prices, or health care costs. If food andmedical care tripled in cost, people would of necessity spend less on otherthings to pay for the increase or cut down on the food and medical care theypurchased.            Falling demand for otherthings would necessarily result in falling prices for those things. Wealthwould indeed be moved around, some people enriched, and others would befinancial losers. But there would not be, nor could there have been, anoverall increase in prices. An overall increase in prices is onlypossible when there has been an overall increase in the amount of money incirculation.            -- BennettWeinberg                        Philadelphia                           Groaning                        In his "" lamenting Matt Groening's absence fromthe Comic Journal 's Top 100 list, A.O. Scott claims that "Groening'swilling, if somewhat ironic, embrace of the marketing bonanza his creation hasunleashed may have cost him his rightful spot in the the ComicsJournal 's highbrow/subculture pantheon."            Oh, really? Then why isCharles Schulz, surely the all-time top marketing whore, listed in the No. 2spot? There must be a better explanation for Groening being left off the list,and there is: Life in Hell sucks. It hasn't been funny or insightful forover a decade. True, the same thing can be said for Peanuts , butPeanuts had a solid 25 years of brilliance before burnout. Groening'sreputation is entirely dependent on two 12-episode series, Work Is Helland School Is Hell . The entire decade since then has just beenAkbar-and-Jeff minimalist filler. Scott confirms this, by the way, by onlytalking about the quality of The Simpsons in his article--an undisputedfact, but the Comics Journal wasn't ranking animators.            -- KimScarborough                        Chicago
