                                 Butting Out            The New York Timesleads with the national tobacco accord's plummeting prospects. The MotherTeresa funeral is the top non-local story at the Washington Post (taking a back seat to the opening of thenew Redskins' stadium) as it is at the Los AngelesTimes (behind a California tax cut and a story about the L.A.mayor).            The Times declares the dramatic $368.5 billion tobacco deal, whichpromised to revolutionize the marketing and regulation of cigarettes when itwas proposed three months ago, "all but dead." Congress has been less thanenthusiastic because many members view the prepackaged deal as trespassing ontheir turf of working out bills. Other big factors: the tobacco lobby'simpolitic attempt to slip a $50 billion rebate into the budget bill, and thewidespread belief that if the companies are willing to pay $368 billion, theymust be able to afford more. The paper reports that although the White Househelped shaped the deal, it has steadily backed away from it--so much so thatPresident Clinton is being urged by advisors to offer only a general outline ofa national tobacco policy rather than a detailed piece of legislation.            One can't help but think that the NYT 's editors have spent a littletoo much time on Princess Diana and Mother Teresa coverage this past week.Their headline for the tobacco deal story? "Tobacco Accord, Once Applauded, IsAll But Buried."            Because of its time-zone advantage, the LAT was able to put itsinitial coverage of the Mother Teresa funeral in its Saturday edition. But theWP and NYT couldn't cover it until today. The NYT accountemphasizes something that the others missed, namely that the crowds inattendance were far smaller than expected. The main reason, says the paper, isthat "the poor, the handicapped and the troubled--the people Mother Teresaspent her life helping--were barred from taking part, at the insistence of theIndian military, largely for security reasons."            The WP runs a front-page story about a graduate entrance examcheating scheme recently broken up by federal investigators. It had beenoperating from coast to coast for three years and before it was discovered hadenabled several hundred students to gain acceptance into graduate schools withfraudulent GRE, GMAT and ESL scores that some had paid up to $9,000 for. Thescheme involved paid expert test-takers on the east coast, lots of cell calls,and the distribution of pencils with answer keys on them to the cheatingtest-takers on the west coast.            The LAT has a front-page piece about one somewhat surprisingconsequence of the Army sex scandals: the service is planning to put intoeffect very soon new physical training standards for women that are much closerto male norms.            The NYT reveals on its front page that it has gotten ahold of thedeposition recently given to Republican Thompson committee lawyers by HaroldIckes. The depo makes it clear that Ickes isn't exactly spilling his guts onthe White House fund-raising operation. In response to the usual request todescribe his background for the record, Ickes replied, "I was born. I grew up.I went to school."            The Times also covers the fundraising scandal in its lead editorial,which says that in light of all the recent revelations, Janet Reno's continuedfailure to call for an special counsel "looks like a political blockingoperation to protect President Clinton and Mr. Gore." The editorial goes on tocall for a special counsel and says it would be a political subterfuge to limithim/her to Mr. Gore. "His boss has earned one, too."            The NYT "Corrections" page carries this item: "A report last Sundayabout the wedding of Lily Changchien and John Richard Middleton Jr. misstatedthe honors with which they graduated from Harvard University. They bothgraduated magna cum laude, not cum laude." At press time, corrected GPAs werenot available.
