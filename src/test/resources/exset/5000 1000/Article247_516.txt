                                 1,001 Arabian Naughts            Saudi Arabia's hesitance about involvement in any U.S. military actionagainst Iraq is the top story at USA Today , the Washington Post , and the New York Times .The USAT headline stresses the Saudi balk, while the headlines at thePost and NYT focus on the U.S. acceptance of it.                           USAT , like the other dailies, passes along the statement made Sundayby the Saudi defense minister to the effect that while his country supportsSaddam's compliance with the U.N. inspection effort, it does not favor anattack on the nation or the people of Iraq. But unlike the Post and theTimes , the paper doesn't illuminate this comment by describing the cold,hard military consequences. Those papers point out that the U.S. decision notto press the issue has meant that it has amassed much striking power elsewhere.The Post gives this order of battle: "F-117 stealth aircraft and A-10fighter jets at Kuwait's Jabir Air Base, B-1 bombers and F-16 and F-15 fighterjets at Bahrain's Sheik Isa Airfield, F-14 and F-18 fighter jets on twocarriers, cruise missiles on a number of other ships and B-52 bombers on theBritish island of Diego Garcia." (Wonder if this means anything to the averagereader. Wonder if it means anything to the Post : the A-10 isn't afighter and the F-18 is a fighter-bomber.) The Post further explainsthat the Saudi stance is also a diplomatic blow, denying the U.S. a potentialsignal of allied unity.            The Post says the Saudi stance has to do with its aversion toinvolvement with any U.S. attack that doesn't have the objective of eliminatingSaddam. But the paper delays explaining the logic until the story's 15thparagraph: The Saudis are afraid that a mere air campaign will leave behind aHussein vengeful towards Gulf neighbors that supported it.            The NYT points out Saudi Arabia will probably grant fly-overprivileges to American bombers taking off from elsewhere.            The Times states that likely U.S. strike targets include RepublicanGuard bases, military command centers and suspected weapons factories andstockpiles. Also, the paper reports an apparent shift in U.S. policy aboutIsraeli self-defense against any Iraqi attacks. Last week, it notes, Secretaryof Defense William Cohen urged Israel to refrain from retaliating, but Sundayhe was quoted as granting Israel the right of self-defense.                           USAT reports the next phase of the Starr investigation: talking tocurrent and former White House interns as a check on Monica's story. TheWSJ says it's very unlikely Starr will bring criminal charges againstPresident Clinton while he's in office, but that he will probably dump thematter into Congress' lap as a potential impeachment case, thus plunging thecountry into a "wrenching political dilemma" given the president's surgingpopularity. The Journal goes on to note that Starr in on record with arather loose interpretation of what counts as an impeachable offense, reportingthat he once argued before the Supreme Court that poisoning the neighbor's cat might be impeachable.            The Journal reports that the FTC is set to end decades of leniencyregarding cigars. Apparently, the agency is moving towards requiring stogiemakers to report their ad and promotion budgets. And is considering furthersteps such as: requiring cigar ads to carry a Surgeon General's healthwarning.            Sunday's Los Angeles Times reports that according to a recentlyreleased man, Iraqi prisons have been the site of hundreds, perhaps thousands,of executions of political prisoners and common criminals in the latter part of1997.            The NYT , in the wake of the Karla Faye Tucker execution, ran inSunday's "Week in Review" a brutally reported and mug-shot illustrated piece bySam Howe Verhovek on some of the other women waiting on America's Death Rows.The piece convinces the reader that Tucker's pickax is not an anomaly: "Amongthe ways condemned women have killed in this country are shooting with anAK-47, slicing with a box cutter, injecting with battery acid, and beating witha baseball bat. One drowned her paralyzed son by pushing him off a canoe on afamily outing, leaving him and his 50 pounds of metal leg braces to sink to thebottom."            The WP says that the Paula Jones trial judge has had an interesting prior run-inwith Bill Clinton. Seems that in law school, she was a student in a course onadmiralty law that Clinton taught. And he lost a bunch of exams including hers.Kind of amazing those exams didn't eventually turn up in the private quartersat the White House.
