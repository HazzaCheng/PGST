The Pacific press is rifewith headlines of economic foreboding. Singapore's Straits Timesreports the "slowdown in growth for the second quarter was acrossall sectors--and is the lowest growth rate in 12 years." The government pledgesthat the country's competitiveness will not erode. Papua New Guinea's PostCourier announces that the PNG government, which depends onsubstantial foreign aid from Australia, is asking the Aussies for a six monthdole advance. Even so, Prime Minister Bill Skate assures the interviewer thatthis is not a sign of "dire economic strife." The data dump from the KoreaTimes predicts that country's economy will shrink by 5 percent to 6percent this year. Bank of Korea spokesman Lee Seong-tae opines that the"economic outlook is getting worse than was anticipated."            Theeconomic news in Australia highlights a surprising budget surplus. The nationalpapers are varying in their response to this good news. The Sydney Morning Herald reports the treasury is aware that the $1.2 billion surplus doesnot mean Australia is now immune to the Asian crisis. Melbourne's Age sees the new figures as denoting "bigger-than-expected tax cuts"in the future, a sentiment that dueled with a quotation from the minister offinance in the Morning Herald : "This Government is not in the businessof looking for cuts." The proposed tax package, described by the prime minister in the Australian as thebiggest tax change in Australia since World War II, includes a fixed 10 percentgoods and service tax, which would "clean up the indirect tax system" andcreate jobs in the process. The package will also reduce taxes on families,extend various personal tax cuts, make changes in the social security tax, andmake way for an "overhaul" of business taxes.            Aunified press criticizes the ruling coalition (the Liberaland National parties) for using the tax plan as an election trump card, and anAge editorial blasts the government, noting that there has been"little headway against unemployment, manufacturing export growth has slowed,and the innovation culture was receding."            Coveringits citizens abroad, the Australian reports that a Somalian arrested in connection with the embassybombing in Tanzania was carrying an Australian passport. Many Pacific countriesare tightening their security as a result of the bombings in Africa. The U.S.State Department has warned that its embassy in Malaysia (along with those inother countries) is under threat. Malaysia's prime minister responded in KualaLumpur's Star, saying the announcement was misleading, as it woulddisplace attention from other countries where the threat is very real, whereas"there are no terrorist activities" in Malaysia. Sri Lanka's Sunday Times alsoreports increased security precautions by the United States inthat country.            Indonesia's Daily Expressalso reports rumors propagated on the Internet predictingdisturbances between Indonesian Muslims and non-Muslims in a popular shoppingdistrict. The Indonesian press and Singapore's Straits Times discountthe rumors as utterly false, citing the deplorable readiness of people tobelieve everything they read on the Internet.            Thailand, meanwhile, hasdiscovered a solution to its ubiquitous drug problem. Two high governmentofficials were reported as discussing the matter, with one condoning extrememeasures when it came to treatment of drug dealers. "Does that measure meanshooting them?" asked one. The response: "You can do whatever with them. Wehave a population of 61 million, 30 million should be sufficient. Do avasectomy!"
