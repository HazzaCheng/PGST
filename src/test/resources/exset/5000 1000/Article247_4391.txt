                                 Real-World Libertarians and the Net                        I'm finding it a bit hard to locate my book in Richard's kickoff to thisdiscussion. Its argument is not, as he suggests, that "liberty converges ontoanarchy." To the contrary: My argument is that a certain form of libertarianismwill lead to less liberty. A certain form of libertarianism--a knee jerklibertarianism that looks at every proposed intervention by government and says"leave the Net alone." My argument is that this response will lead to a Netwith far less liberty than the Net we know now, with a potential to be far moreregulated than any world we have known--ever.            How?            That's the second part of the argument that seems to have gone missing: thatthe liberty, or freedom, that cyberspace guarantees now is a function of thearchitecture of that space. That that architecture--which I call "code,"meaning the software and hardware that constitutes cyberspace as it is--wasinitially an architecture that protected fundamental freedoms. But that thatarchitecture is changing. As it changes, the freedoms that the Net willguarantee changes as well.            How is it changing?            This is the third part AWOL in this initial kickoff of a discussion. Theoriginal architecture, given to us by researchers and hackers and generallylibertarian sorts, is being changed as new layers of code are being added tothis architecture. And these new layers are being added not by the samelibertarian sorts who gave us the initial version of the Internet. They arebeing added by coders who work for commerce. The values implicit in their codeare different from the values implicit in the code of the original Internet.And under one story about how that code evolves, they threaten to flip thecharacter of the Net--from a place that protects liberty to a place whereliberty has been coded away.            Rather than focusing on those arguments, Richard wants to defend"libertarianism"--a cause that he has admirably defended for a great deal oftime. Libertarianism is not, Richard says, quoting me, the view that"government is the enemy"; nor is it a focus on "reducing government's power."That is "not the way in which a libertarian ... thinks about government."Rather, the libertarian "starts in the state of nature." His or her "objectivefunction starts with the goal of minimizing the use of force and fraud in humaninteractions. The hard part of the system is to figure out a way in which thatminimization takes place over both public and private actors."            But there is "libertarianism" in the Ivory Tower and there is"libertarianism" on the ground. I recognize the species that Richard describes;I am a permanent resident of the Ivory Tower. But my book describes a presentpolitical attitude, not the Ivory Tower. It is about a present politicalreality, and a present rhetorical push. I am describing it because I have beenwatching it for the past six years. In that world, if someone argued (asRichard does above) that a "law of privacy" was needed, as well as lawprotecting trade secrets; that laws regulating libel and slander werenecessary, as well as a law regulating blackmail; if one even raised the issueof taxation, or suggested that the government was needed to "secure theinfrastructure", then one would not be a "libertarian." One would be a Red. Thelibertarian of the Net has a simple message, quite different from Ivory TowerLibertarianism. It is: Keep the government out.            Now of course this is an extreme, but the extreme affects the mean. And sowhile there are few who would insist that the government always stay out, ithas become mainstream to argue that the government should just leave the Netalone. "Let the Net take care of itself," is the slogan of our generation--andthe current administration. But if we do, then the Net will become somethingvery different from what it is just now.            That's the argument of my book. Not an attack on Ivory Tower Libertarianism.Nor even an attack on "sensible libertarianism." But an attack on a certaindo-nothingness that pervades our present political culture.            So forgive me, Richard, if I decline your sending it "over to" me "toexplain why the same version of sensible libertarianism ... should not guideour activities in cyberspace." That's the question of your many valuable andimportant books. My book asks a different set of questions. Let me send it backover to you to address some of them.
