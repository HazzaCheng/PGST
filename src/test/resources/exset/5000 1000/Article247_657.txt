                                 Geffen Till It Hurts                           USAToday , the New York Times ,and the Washington Post lead with the revelation that theambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had been so concerned about herembassy's vulnerability that months before the Nairobi bombings, she had askedthe State Dept. to build a new one--a request that State denied, citing lack offunds. The Los Angeles Times , which includes the Bushnell story in itsfront-page bombing aftermath story, but puts it deep in the story after thejump, goes instead with the decision by two Swiss banks to pay $1.25 billion toHolocaust survivors and relatives to compensate for the Nazi victims' depositsthey held onto after World War II, a story that also gets front space atUSAT and the NYT . The move came just weeks after the Swissgovernment had declared it would pay no more than half that sum, but also, theLAT points out, after several state and local governments, in defianceof the Clinton administration position, said they would begin levelingsanctions against the banks.            According to the papers, Ambassador Bushnell's main concern was that herpost was located on a crowded downtown street. USAT and the WPreport that Bushnell even wrote directly to Secretary of State MadeleineAlbright about the problem, going so far, says USAT , as inviting her tocome see for herself, something Albright never did. The NYT adds thatthe U.S. military command covering the region also expressed concern about theembassy's security. The NYT and WP quote State sources claimingthat even if Bushnell's request had been honored, the completion of a newembassy would have taken years, and hence the U.S. would have still occupiedthe old one at the time of the bombing. None of the reporting mentions it, butthis sort of development is sadly familiar--it was reported after the fact thatthe Marines' commanding officer in Beirut in 1983 had expressed grave concernto his superiors about the vulnerability of his troops to hostile forcesoperating in the area.            The LAT has a front-page story confirming that the woman in the Kenyarubble known to rescuers only as "Rose" (full name: Rose Wanjiku Mwangi) wasfound dead on Wednesday. Her head had been protected from three stories ofrubble by a table. She had been dead for as little as 24 hours when she wasfound.            The WP reports that Tanzanian police are looking for the assistant tothe driver of the water truck believed to have harbored the bomb deployedagainst the U.S. embassy in Dar-es-Salaam. The body of the driver, believed tohave been a faithful embassy employee, was found in the wreckage. Theassistant's was not.            The NYT front reports that the new Clinton legal defense fund, free of some of the legalrestrictions of the old one that was disbanded earlier this year, has alreadybeen much more successful, bringing in more than $2 million in just six months.The paper says funds have come in from "Main Street, Wall Street andHollywood," in response to a direct mail campaign seizing on hostility towardKenneth Starr, but makes it seem that Hollywood has been particularlyimportant, mentioning such donors as David Geffen, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg,Jeffrey Katzenberg, Harvey Weinstein, and Bud Yorkin. Geffen is quotedexplaining his $10,000 donation this way: "There is a well-financed group ofzealots who want to bring down the President. And this guy has no money. He'sbroke. This is a terrible situation." The Clintons' legal expenses are nowestimated at $6 million, with the potential, says the Times , to grow ata clip of $1 million a year.            A staple newspaper feature is the academic convention piece, which featureselbow-patched and distracted professors virtually unaware that they've ploppeddown into a big hotel in a big city because they're so terminally immersed intheir profession, such as it is. Today's WP features a particularly ripetarget for the genre--a philosophers' convention. Imagine--3,000 academics in onehotel, not one of them sure the others are really there too! But before youlaugh too much at these Platos without a Republic, consider this Postfactoid: the employment rate for philosophy Ph.D.'s is 98.9 percent.
