                                 Brox Crox Redux!            Turns out David Brock's recent Esquire confessional didn't quiteconfess to everything. In Esquire , Brock writes that "a majorcontributor to Newt Gingrich's GOPAC" introduced him to the "gothic world ofanti-Clintonism." Why would Brock, in his tell-all, decline to name this "majorcontributor?" Now we know. Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times reportedthis week that the "contributor," a Chicago investment banker named PeterSmith, did more than introduce Brock to the anti-Clinton world. He paidBrock $5,000 for "research expenses." ... What's wrong with a reporter takingmoney like that? Nothing, at least in Chatterbox's book. Brock apparentlywasn't a full-time employee of the American Spectator at the time. Sosomeone who wants a story written paid him to research the story. When the FordFoundation does the same thing, they call it a prestigious fellowship! ... Butif Brock thought it was OK to take the money, why did he seemingly hidethat fact in Esquire ? And why did it apparently take Smith showing thecancelled $5,000 check to Sweet to get Brock to fess up? In the New YorkPost , Brock is quoted as saying "I didn't immediately remember, but I neverdenied it. ... I said if [Smith] has the documentation, I'd be happy to confirmit." Do you believe Brock didn't remember getting $5,000 from a secretiveanti-Clinton operative? Private citizens don't run around offering that kind ofmoney to freelance journalists every day, at least that has (unfortunately)been Chatterbox's experience. It's especially implausible that Brock "didn'tremember" the payment when he had just finished writing what was supposed to bea confessional article detailing his own journalistic missteps in the serviceof the Clinton-haters--an article that included criticism of "the GOPACmoneyman" (Smith) for offering to give "legal expense" checks to theanti-Clinton troopers. But if Brock is dissembling about his memory of the$5,000, what else is he dissembling about? .... Brock didn't return a phonecall asking for comment. Here Chatterbox goes the extra mile to be fair, andlook what happens! ...                           Follow-Up on the News!: As predicted in yesterday's Chatterbox, therelatively good news contained in the overall admissions figures for the entire8-campus University of California system--which showed black and Hispanicadmissions dropping by only 17 and 7 percent, respectively, in the wake ofProp. 209's rollback of race preferences--was either ignored or buried by thepress. Neither the New York Times or Washington Post carried thestory. The Los Angeles Times ran a below-the-fold piece on page A3, theheadline and lead paragraphs of which discussed the non-news that UC plans, asit always does, to offer qualified students rejected by their chosen campusesspots somewhere in the UC system. Only in the fourth paragraph doeseducation writer Kenneth Weiss note the "figures released Thursday showing thatblacks and Latinos systemwide did not fare as badly as they had at theuniversity's most competitive campuses." Contrast this with the front-pagetreatment given two days earlier in the LAT , New York Times andWashington Post to the bad news about the large drops in black andLatino admissions at those two most-competitive campuses, Berkeley and UCLA.Chatterbox's paranoid fears have been borne out! This will only encourage him....            Some readers wondered why Chatterbox made such a big deal about the delayedrelease of the UC systemwide figures, since the figures for each of the eightindividual UC campuses were available earlier, and indeed were printed on theback page of the New York Times in a chart accompanying the April 1story about the grim Berkeley and UCLA results. Couldn't any intelligentreader--or Chatterbox--have just added up the figures from the 8 campuses toget the systemwide total? The answer is no. If you did that, you'd double-counta student who was accepted, say, to both UCLA and San Diego. Only when theuniversity itself recalculated the 8-campus figures to eliminate thisduplication were accurate systemwide results available to the press. Too badthey didn't get reported. ...
