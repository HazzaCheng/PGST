                                 Microsoft's Macrodrama            The Washington Post 's lead reports that local HMOs are planningto dramatically hike Medicare recipients' co-payments and premiums. Tens ofthousands of elderly will be impacted. The New York Times leads with Gov. GeorgePataki's decision to impose vehicle emission standards that are stricter thanfederal requirements. The new statewide standards, which will be phased inbeginning with the 2004 model year, would require automakers to halve theamount of pollution emitted by the cars that are currently being manufactured.California has promulgated identical standards and Massachusetts is expected tofollow the megastates' lead. The concerted actions will encourage manufacturersto produce vehicles which satisfy the strictest state requirements.            All papers devote front-page space to analyzing the impact of the Microsoftantitrust trial's findings of fact. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found thatMicrosoft was a bullying monopolist whose business tactics hurt consumers andsuppressed innovation. (Consult                   Slate               's MSDispatches for a colorful bow-by-blow of the trial.) The Los AngelesTimes lead claims that the findings will compound problems that arealready eroding Microsoft's dominance of the software industry, including: thedefection of top talent; the emergence of new computing platforms; and theevolution of Web-based applications.            In a front-page analysis, the Post agrees that "Microsoft seemsvulnerable," noting that Windows 2000 is two years behind schedule. But theWP argues that with $19 billion in cash, the software giant (whichpublishes                   Slate               ) should be able to adapt totechnological shifts. Another Post piece explores the legal aftermath ofFriday's findings. Before the judge renders his verdict, both sides will submitbriefs on how antitrust law should apply to the facts. Microsoft might appeal,and the next president could order the Justice Department to abandon thecase.            A NYT front-pager quotes an analyst's prediction that Microsoft stockmight decline in value by as much as 10 percent, a drop which would erase $47billion in shareholder wealth. Another front-page piece chronicles Microsoft'sbelated efforts to win friends in Washington. In 1998, the company's politicalcontributions shot up to $1.3 million and its lobbying budget doubled to $3.74million. Microsoft's lobbyists include former Republican National CommitteeChairman Haley Barbour, whose firm received $600,000 from the company lastyear. The article suggests that Microsoft might have already received a returnon its investment: Last June company officials met with Republican leaders.Eight days later, the GOP leadership introduced a list of legislativeinitiatives which adopted Microsoft's view of antitrust law.            Accompanied by a picture of Pope John Paul II at Mohandas Gandhi'sgravesite, the LAT fronts the pontiff's "call to conversion" during hisvisit to India. The pope issued a proclamation, expressing the hope that "agreat harvest of faith will be reaped on this vast and vital continent" andarguing that "Asia is thirsting for the living water that Jesus alone cangive." Hindu activists recently called for a halt to what they perceive as"forced conversions." Both Times es report that police officers beatand arrested three demonstrators who dared to chant: "No conversions." AWP account notes that the visit comes in the midst of a Hindufestival.            The NYT Op-Ed page publishes a two-fronted assault on George W.Bush's inability to name the leaders of India, Pakistan, and Chechnya. MaureenDowd writes: "His intensive foreign affairs coaching ... supposedly began lastwinter, yet the gaffes keep coming." Thomas Friedman suggests a makeup exam. AWP editorial argues that Bush exhibited a worrisome attitude towardsdemocracy when he stated that the Pakistani coup was "good news for thesubcontinent." The Post reports that Bill Bradley refused to answer whenasked who the leader of North Korea is. Bradley objected to the question onprinciple, arguing that "politicians have to draw the line."            A Post piece on the leading candidate for Guatemala's presidencyprovides perspective on the frailties of American leaders. Alfonso Portillo isrunning on a law-and-order platform. His television ads proudly proclaim: "Aman who can defend his own life can defend yours." The slogan refers to thefact that 17 years ago the frontrunner fatally shot two men during a barroombrawl. Portillo leads by twelve points in the polls--compelling evidence thatvoters prefer alpha males.
