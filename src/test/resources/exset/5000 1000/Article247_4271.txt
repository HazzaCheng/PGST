                                 Reality Bites Value America                        Whatever the Internet will become, one of the things it's been in the lastcouple of years is a consumer's paradise, at least from a price perspective. Intheir hunger to acquire new customers, Net retailers have engaged in goodold-fashioned price wars and have more generally made Net shoppers soaccustomed to sizable discounts that paying anything close to retail feels likeyou're being robbed.            The question, of course, has always been whether these retailers wereactually ever going to be able to make money when their business often seemed,as venture capitalist Bill Gurley so smartly put it, to be the equivalent ofgiving consumers who visited their sites a dollar in exchange for 95 cents. Inthe past few weeks, we're starting to see signs that, in fact, a lot of theseInternet retailers are not only not going to be able to make money. They maynot even be able to stay in business for much longer.            The most telling such sign was the announcement yesterday by Value Americathat it was going to slash its work force by 47 percent, slim down its productofferings, leave five of the 12 buildings it now occupies, and make meaningfulcuts in its ad spending. Value America also announced that its revenue for thefourth quarter will fall 6 percent to 9 percent short of analysts' estimatesand that it will lose significantly more than analysts had expected in thequarter.            Value America has been this one-stop shopping site, where you could buyeverything from food to printers to appliances to computers. (Computers likethe one on which I'm writing this column, actually, bought this summer for avery nice price.) It now plans to focus on selling computers and consumerelectronics, which on the one hand is a natural strategy for targeting Webusers and, on the other hand, is a strategy that everyone else in America hasalready figured out and embraced. So the idea that the new approach is going torescue the company seems rather dubious.            What's interesting about the Value America story, though, is that itrepresents an unusual intrusion of the things we've gotten used to aboutoffline business into the online world. Up to this point, with rare exceptions,business on the Internet has seemed to exist in this fairy-tale realm where noone ever gets fired, where expenses are irrelevant, and where all losses aretolerated as simply necessary investments in the future. By eliminating 280jobs, cutting the number of suppliers it uses by 90 percent, and admitting thatit's running through its capital much faster than originally planned, ValueAmerica is essentially demonstrating what we all knew, but just weren't surewhen it would come true: Eventually, you have to earn a profit or else you'llgo under.            Now, there are limits to the value, so to speak, of Value America as acautionary tale. In the first place, the site was never that popular, and evennow is only the 90th most popular Web shopping site. More important, ValueAmerica's everything-including-the-kitchen-sink strategy was ill-conceived,especially for a company that had no real brand name. For Amazon.com to branchout from books into CDs and then videos and then consumer electronics means onething. For Value America to start by offering everything is another. And,finally, there are Net retailers--Amazon, most notably--who are not justrunning a business on hope, smoke, and mirrors; who have thought seriouslyabout their cost structures; and understand things like return on investedcapital. That doesn't mean they will succeed, but it means they have a muchbetter chance than most of the companies out there.            Even so, what's happening to Value America does have implications for theNet as a whole, especially when so many Net retailers dumped tens of millionsof dollars into pre-Christmas advertising with, by all accounts, very littlepayoff (relative to investment). And perhaps the most important thing to thinkabout is that if Value America goes under, it increasingly looks like it willdo just that: go under and disappear. In other words, no one is going to comealong and acquire it, because ultimately there's really nothing there toacquire. The conventional wisdom has been that eventually we'd seeconsolidation in Net retailing through mergers and acquisitions. It's startingto seem more likely that we'll see consolidation through failure.
