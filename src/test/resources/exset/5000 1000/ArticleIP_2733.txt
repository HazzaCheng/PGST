                                 Executive Privileges            Her lips as vivid as theplumage of the vermilion flycatcher, Monica Lewinsky returns this week to thecovers of the Star and the National Enquirer . In a detailedaccount of her White House trysts, the Star portrays Lewinsky as a sortof Jewish Salome, arousing the president with her dance of the Gap dress, onlyto hand the independent counsel the head of Bill the Southern Baptist.According to the publication, Lewinsky told the grand jury of at least foursexual encounters (depending on your definition of the phrase) in Clinton'soffice.            Apparently the president is a man with precise, if deranged, views on thematter. How many 51-year-olds could write philosophic treatises on getting tofirst, second, and third base? The Star reports that Lewinsky says thepresident allowed them to engage in kissing and "heavy petting" while they hadtheir clothes on. Once things got hot, however, "[h]e and Monica wouldunclench--and she would perform a private strip show for the president," makingsure "the two refrained from touching each other." All right, Abelard andHloise it's not--with the staining of the dress it's probably closer to "Hintsfrom Heloise." The damned spot occurred, says the Star , during one ofthese episodes, while the dress lay on the carpet. The Star 's "source"explains that Clinton "believes that if they weren't touching in any state ofundress, that it's not technically sexual relations." Let's see, making outwith someone, then ejaculating while she strips in your office does notconstitute sexual relations. Bill, that's good, that's good.            The Star also reports that a Secret Service agentand former top Clinton aide Harold Ickes "walked in on the president and hisyoung guest while the two were enjoying an extended stay in the private study."It does not report if Clinton subsequently began to hang "Do Not Disturb" signson White House doorknobs.            Ickesmakes a very different kind of appearance in the National Enquirer 'sMonica package. In it he is Cassandra, cursed to have his propheciesdisbelieved: "When Ickes first tried to tell Clinton that Monica was spreadingstories that could be harmful to him, he refused to listen." In this version ofevents, Clinton got sucked into an innocent "paternal" relationship (we'reentering Woody Allen territory here) with a woman he supposedly characterizedas "wide-eyed and young and I knew she got a thrill out of talking to me." Whathe eventually came to realize, the Enquirer quotes him telling friends,is that "[t]he woman is dangerous. She hallucinates. She fantasizes. I don'tknow if she even knows what the truth really is anymore."            On the other hand, according to another storyin the very same issue, the Enquirer reports what no one else has--thatshe and Clinton went all the way. In this version of events, Lewinsky believedtheir dalliance was a true love affair. "I thought he turned to me because hiswife is so cold," another insider has her saying. But soon she realized she wasnot to be Clinton's Wallis Warfield Simpson. "I saw my dreams start to unravelwhen he told me I should return the gifts," she is quoted as saying. Despitefeeling humiliated and enraged, she did it, because "I didn't want him to behurt. I loved him."            Sinceit's difficult to reconcile the portrait of the "virtual psychopath who hadcreated an entire fantasy world involving the President, a woman who now wantedto destroy him," with the woman who was pursued then "coldly dumped" by him,the only prudent conclusion to draw from the Enquirer is that we haveone wacky White House.            The Enquirer also calls in the services of forensicpsychiatrist Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber to analyze the meaning of the dress."It's very, very bizarre. Why would she keep the dress? Why would she send itto her mother? The normal thing is if you stain something, you wash it off."Densen-Gerber is obviously a disciple of the One-Hour Martinizing school ofpsychiatry.            Finally, this whole sordidepisode might open a new category of collectible. Stephen Fishler, acollectibles expert, tells the Enquirer if the dress contains Clinton'ssemen and it leads to impeachment proceedings, it could fetch $500,000. Semen,schemen is the reaction of collector Jesse Briggs, who has already madean offer (are formal bids being accepted?) of $100,000 for the frock, no matterwhat the result.            And don't look to theGlobe for more Monica madness. It is staying out of this whole tawdrymess, preferring to examine more elevated topics such as the possibility thatactor Jim Carrey believes the spirit of late comedian Andy Kaufman has takenover his body.
