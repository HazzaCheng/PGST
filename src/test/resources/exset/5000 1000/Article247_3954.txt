                                 George W., Folklorist            George W. Bush gave a speech on Nov. 2 advocating "moral education." Chatterbox agreesthat "values" should play a larger role in educating children, which is why hesupports well-regulated programs requiring high-school kids to performvolunteer service of some kind. A danger of injecting "values" more fully intoschool curricula, however, is that if it isn't done thoughtfully, it will endup presenting certain pious and erroneous sentiments as fact. This is anoft-noted weakness of some of the liberal "values" teaching that already goeson in schools--a lot of silly misinformation about the environment and ancientAfrican civilizations, for example, routinely ends up being passed along bybumfuzzledelementary-school teachers. This drives conservatives (and even many liberals)batty. Increasingly, something similar seems to be happening when"conservative" values (like a literal belief in the Bible) get taught at theexpense of evolutionary science. If moral lessons are to be taught moreforthrightly in schools, it's important that the distinction between knowledgeand folklore be maintained.            In his speech, though, Bush himself seems to have stumbled over thatdistinction. In a litany of examples in which teen-agers have shown "characterand courage beyond measure," Bush cited the following:                                             When a gun is aimed at a seventeen-year-old in Colorado--and she is shotfor refusing to betray her Lord.                                       This refers to Cassie Bernall, one of the teen-agers shot by theirclassmates Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris at last April's Columbine High Schoolmassacre. Shortly after the shooting, the horrifying story spread that beforeshe was shot, one of the two killers asked her if she believed in God. She saidyes, and the gun was fired. The anecdote became the basis for cover stories inthe Weekly Standard and Christianity Today and for a best-sellingbook, She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of CassieBernall , written by Cassie's mother, Misty Bernall. But as was reportedsomewhat tentatively on Sept. 25 in Salon and subsequently confirmed elsewhere, the storyalmost certainly isn't true. "We strongly doubt that conversation everoccurred," Steve Davis, spokesman for the Jefferson County, Colo., sheriff'soffice, told the Washington Post 's Hanna Rosin.            What investigators now believe really happened is that anothergirl, Valeen Schnurr, was shot in both arms and then asked if shebelieved in God. Schnurr said yes and, for whatever reason, the assailantwandered off without harming her further. (Schnurr recovered and is now afreshman at the University of Northern Colorado.) She Said Yesacknowledges this in a backhanded way, with the caveat that "the exact detailsof Cassie's death ... may never be known." In the Post piece, whichappeared on Oct. 14, Rosin explained that Schnurr is not going out of her wayto tell her story, because whenever she does it's interpreted as a betrayal ofBernall. "You will never change the story of Cassie," the Bernalls' pastor,Dave McPherson, told Rosin:                                             The church is going to stick to the martyr story. It's the story theyheard first, and circulated for six months uncontested. You can say it didn'thappen that way, but the church won't accept it. To the church, Cassie willalways say yes, period.                                       What goes for the church apparently goes for George W. Bush too. It'sinconceivable that Bush and his staff don't know the Bernall story has beendiscredited; Bush's speechwriter, Mike Gerson, was until a few months ago ajournalist , for Pete's sake. (A very good one; Chatterbox used to workwith him at U.S. News .) At the risk of sounding judgmental--and meaning,of course, no disrespect to Cassie Bernall and her tragic murder--Chatterboxconcludes that Bush's decision to use the story anyway is something a littleworse than exploitative. It's immoral.
