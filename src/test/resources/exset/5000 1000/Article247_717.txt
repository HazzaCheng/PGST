                                 Cave Mandela            After a week of much news uniformity, lead diversity makes a typical Sundayappearance. The Los Angeles Times lead furthers the emerging picture ofconnections between Kenneth Starr's office and the Paula Jones defense teamwith details on Linda Tripp's interactions with the two camps in the early daysof the Lewinsky scandal. The Washington Post goes with the effects of Thursday'simpeachment-related vote on the midterm election campaigns. The New YorkTimes lead apparently goes as far as it can get from the presidentialscandal--with word that the major oil companies are probably not going to builda pipeline for Caspian Sea oil along a route that was pushed hard by theClinton administration. (Pushed because it would pass only through therelatively friendly countries of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey--binding themfurther to the West--instead of passing through Russia or Iran.) The paper saysthe oil companies have probably decided the U.S.-backed route is too expensiveto build now. Actually, according to the Times the decision does have a scandalangle: the paper quotes one senator saying that Clinton lost the power of moralpersuasion with the oil companies because of the scandals surrounding him.            The LAT lead reveals that contrary to standard practice, Kenneth Starr'sprosecutors did not instruct their chief witness Linda Tripp not to talk to theJones attorneys. Since it is now known that Tripp gave the Jones lawyers muchof the information about Lewinsky they used to elicit Clinton's problematicstatements during his deposition, the LAT wonders: "Did Starr help to pave theway for Clinton to commit the alleged perjury that his prosecutors thenproceeded to investigate?" The paper quotes the Starr office's response: "Wehad no reason to know and did not know [Tripp] was talking to the Joneslawyers."            The WP front also features a story about the Tripp-Starr-Jones nexus, butwhere the LAT focuses on how Tripp helped Jones, the Post says she abandonedJones to help Starr. Incidentally, unlike the LAT lead, the Post piece does notmention the earlier reporting by the NYT and Newsday.            The Post lead claims that candidates across the country feel stuck dealingwith the Clinton scandal often at the expense of local issues. But the paperalso says strategists in both parties say any Republican advantage stemmingfrom the scandal has been eroding recently. The NYT front-pager election piecesees a general trend toward voter uncertainty about who to blame for thescandal, which could altogether neutralize it as a voting factor.            The death at age 91 of Washington insider Clark Clifford, multi-presidentialadvisor and late in his life a figure in an international bank scandal, garnersfront-page notice at the NYT and WP and a picture-with-reefer at the LAT. Incontrast to the generally glowing obits is the piece on the NYT op-ed page byhistorical biographer Kai Bird, who argues against the Wise Man TheoryWashington still clings to. Citing the Wise Men's too-long silence on therealities of Vietnam they knew all too well, Bird argues that the likes ofClifford have always valued loyalty over truth, and hence their wisdom hasrarely done the country much good. All this on a page long congenial to WiseMen, even to the point in recent weeks of running scandal advice from suchcard-carriers as Gerald Ford and Elliott Richardson.            The NYT Week in Review has two real nuggets. There's the item revealing thattwo black Clinton Cabinet secretaries, the late Ron Brown and (the probablywishing he was late) Mike Espy, were required to submit urine samples for drugtests, while two white Cabinet officers revealed they were not. (The paper addsthat White House staffers are tested, but the president is not.)            Then there's the Times' new Johannesburg bureau chief Suzanne Daleyreporting from the field that while perhaps racism is on the wane in SouthAfrica, sexism is not. She regales the reader with story after story in whichSouth African men of all stripes treat her badly and/or assume that her husbandis the sole being in her marriage with decision-making ability and authority.There are no joint checking accounts, and women seem to understand that makeupand cleavage are civic duties. And there's Daley's story about what NelsonMandela said about her in her presence to her boss, Joseph Lelyveld, theexecutive editor of the NYT: "In my day, if you had a wife who looked likethat, you would be embarrassed. In my day, a woman needed a little more meat onher bones."
