                                 Wilted            Everybody leads with the bloodless military overthrow of Pakistan'sdemocratically elected government. The majors all cite the same immediatebackground: While army commander Gen. Pervez Musharraf was out of the country(in Sri Lanka), the civilian prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, fired him.Thereafter army units quickly took to the streets and overran key governmentfacilities. ( USA Today and the New York Times front the samepicture of troops going over the fence at the government TV station, mooningthe world in the process.) Then Musharraf returned, and after placing Sharifand several other top officials under house arrest, announced that he was incharge.            The papers also agree on the main background factors: The army had beenupset that this past summer Sharif, bowing to U.S. pressure, had called for thewithdrawal of Pakistani-supported guerrillas from Kashmir, where they had beenin a shooting war with Indian forces. The Washington Post has the most fine-grained causal list,adding as factors Sharif's failure to authorize a military response to India'sJuly shoot-down of a Pakistani navy training flight, his promise to considersigning the comprehensive test ban treaty, and his plans to divert money fromthe military to housing for the poor. The Post also mentions the army'sdistaste for Sharif's attempts to cut ties to Afghanistan's Taliban militia.Only the Los Angeles Times includes anything negative about Sharif,noting that he has jailed dissidents.            The papers report that India went on high alert upon hearing of the coup.Both the WP and LAT report that the Clinton administration hadwarned in recent weeks against any extra-constitutional ouster of thegovernment. But the LAT says that there is no immediate concern in theU.S. government regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons, because, explainsUSAT , they have been presumed to be in the military's hands all along.The NYT says that if the U.S. government confirms the coup, it will nolonger conduct business as usual with Pakistan. The LAT adds: If thathappens, U.S. law requires cutting foreign assistance. (It would have been niceif the paper had said what law. How long has it been in existence?) TheLAT , in case you had doubts, passes along word that Gen. Musharraf "hasa reputation as a tough, no-nonsense soldier." Just once Today's Papers wantsto read about a soft, all-laughs soldier!            Perhaps it comes as no surprise what the sports-addled press views as theday's other big story: the death, at age 63, from an apparent heart attack, ofWilt Chamberlain. Every paper fronts this, with USATand the LAT putting it top-front. USAT 's piece puts Chamberlain'sclaim to have slept with 20,000 women in the seventh paragraph of itseight-paragraph story. The WP puts it in the fifth paragraph out of 25;the LAT in the fifth paragraph of 59. The NYT front-page effortnever mentions the alleged feat. The LAT runs a story inside by one-timebiographer David Shaw that provides a bit of evidence for the claim: Shawwrites of a time that he was out at a restaurant with Chamberlain andChamberlain's date when the player excused himself to get the phone number of awoman at another table. And another time, Shaw says, Chamberlain ushered himout of his hotel room in order to entertain three women simultaneously. (Shawdoesn't say if he put these stories in his book.)            Both the NYT and WP report inside that the U.N. civilianworker killed in Kosovo two days ago was probably assaulted by Albanians afterhe responded to a question they posed to him in Serbian with an answer inSerbian. Both papers also report that in Burundi yesterday, several civilianU.N. officials were murdered by Hutu rebels.            The Wall Street Journal front-page news box dutifully reportsthat yesterday the Dow dropped 231 points--a reduction in value of 2.2percent--on, it says, inflation worries. What's particularly noteworthy, and asign that the papers are maturing when it comes to market swings, is that, on arelatively slow news day, no other paper fronts the story.            The USAT front-page "Snapshot" gives an economic picture, based onCensus Bureau stats, of the estimated 44 million Americans without healthinsurance. More than a quarter of whom, says the chart, earn more than$50,000.            The WP runs an AP report inside about the first documented actual Y2K glitch. It seems that theMaine state government has issued, according to a computer's instructions,titles for model year 2000 cars and trucks identifying the vehicles as"horseless carriages," a designation meant to be reserved for vintage vehiclesproduced before 1916. The state has spent, says the AP, millions in an effortto make its computers Y2K-compliant.
