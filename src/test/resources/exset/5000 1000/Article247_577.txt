                                 Whitewater Torture            The Whitewater indictment of Susan McDougal leads at USA Today andthe Washington Post . The Unabomber life-plus sentenceimposed on Theodore Kacszynski leads at the New York Timesand LosAngeles Times . While McDougal is still front-page where it doesn'tlead, the Unabomber doesn't make the front at the WP .            McDougal was indicted for criminal contempt and obstruction by the ArkansasWhitewater grand jury for refusing to answer questions posed by Ken Starr.Having already completed an 18-month civil contempt sentence for refusing toanswer Starr's questions and now serving time for her Whitewater fraudconviction, she could get ten years if convicted on these new charges. TheLAT says the move is an escalation of Starr's investigation. USATsays it's his final effort to force McDougal to cooperate.            The indictment contains some new information. At one point in the grand juryroom, McDougal said, "Mr. Starr should resign. That's my only answer to you."And the evidence she was questioned about there but did not explain includes a$5,081.82 check she made out in 1983 bearing the notation, "Payoff Clinton."(The NYT carries substantial excerpts from one of McDougal's grand juryappearances.)            The Post quotes some legal experts saying it's highly unusual toprosecute someone for criminal contempt who has already served a civil sentencefor the same refusal to testify. (Small but important point: the USATstory never mentions that McDougal was granted immunity. But this is preciselywhat makes her silence indictable. The WP and the NYT get this right.)            The Unabomber sentencing proceedings included a statement from him as wellas remarks by victims and survivors of victims. The LAT says Kacszynskiwas "unrepentant" and "steely-eyed," and the victims "anguished." A widow'ssuggestion to the court makes everybody's story: "Lock him so far down thatwhen he dies, he'll be closer to hell."            If you're wondering what sort of service to look out for when NationsBankcompletes its recently announced $60 billion merger with BankAmerica to becomethe nation's largest bank, take a gander at the WP front, which reportsthat NationsBank, without admitting guilt (or denying any wrongdoing), agreed to pay $6.75 million in fines to settle charges it soldhigh-risk investment funds as safe banking products, mostly to elderlycustomers who suffered significant losses. Three senior executives at the bankalso received fines from $35,000 to $100,000. The story doesn't say, but"Today's Papers" guesses these fines don't represent as much of a dent to thebankers as the uninsured losses did to the elderly investors. After all, theyonly amount to one-ten-thousandth of the value of the merged company.            The WP front reports that on the strength of news stories about tinybiotech firm EntreMed's promising cancer drugs, the company's stock pricequadrupled yesterday. In an inside piece, the NYT details thisdevelopment and a concomitant rise in the hope market as well.            The Wall Street Journal reports that about only about 5% of thefive million workplace drug tests administered last year by one major lab cameout positive. That's down from 5.8 % the year before and from 18.1 % in1987.            The NYT reports that a black U.S. Marine was severely beaten in broad daylight in a busyMoscow park by a band of Russian skinheads. Skinhead assaults have become sucha problem, reports the Times , that the American Embassy has twicealerted U.S. citizens, particularly those of African or Asian origin about thedanger of unprovoked attacks. Other embassies have done the same. Foreignstudent groups complain that Russian cops routinely fail to protect them. Thestory is carried inside, as it was in the LAT on Monday, and thequestion is, why? If a white Russian embassy guard was viciously assaulted byblack thugs in Washington, "Today's Papers" thinks it would be a page one storyeverywhere, in this country and beyond.
