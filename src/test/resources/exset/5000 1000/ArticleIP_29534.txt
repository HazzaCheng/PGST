                                 How Free Is Louise?            Theindictment of President Slobodan Milosevic by the International War CrimesTribunal in the Hague was variously interpreted Friday in the European press.The hawkish papers of Fleet Street raised loud hurrahs, while some of the moredovish ones on the continent were gloomy about its effects on the Kosovo war.There was also widespread suspicion that NATO's war leaders had more to do withthe timing of Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour's announcement than she, insistingon the independence of her U.N. role, cared to admit. There was generalunanimity, however, that her decision made a peace settlement much moredifficult to achieve and increased the prospect of NATO ground troops beingeventually deployed in Kosovo against Serb resistance.            InLondon, the Times and the Daily Telegraph , both conservative papers, were delighted.The Telegraph said the indictment would put muscle into the UnitedStates because "though Bill Clinton might be happy to compromise with afugitive from justice, the American people could not stomach such a peace withdishonour." The Times said the West "has to thank the brave Canadianjudge" for ending any chance that NATO would grant Milosevic immunity fromarrest and prosecution--one of his principal peace conditions. Such immunitywould not only be "morally repellent," it was "now illegal," it said.            Theliberal Independent of London was no less pleased, saying Milosevicshould have been indicted long ago. Its main front-page headline said the indictment has split the allies, but this waseffectively contradicted in an article by its political editor, Donald Macintyre, claiming thatthe European allies were holding much closer to the U.S. and British positionsthan was generally imagined and that German Chancellor Gerhard Schrder'smuch-reported statement that a ground invasion was "unthinkable" had actuallymeant only that German troops would not participate. Clearly relying on Britishgovernment sources, Macintyre wrote that even the Italians don't rule outentering Kosovo in "non-permissive" circumstances, but instead he described itas "hypothetical" (though in an interview Thursday with the Italian magazinePanorama , Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini warned that Italy would"dissociate itself" from an invasion).            Theliberal Guardian of London, while leading with the headline "Warcrimes move dims peace hope," pronounced the indictment "overwhelminglypositive" and said it augured well "not just for the resolution of this war,but for the world of the twenty-first century." Its international commentator,Martin Woollacott, wrote that the indictment, combined with the commitment ofmore ground troops, a hardening of NATO's peace terms, and the intensificationof the air campaign, represents "a new strategy." It marks a moment when "NATOceases to be ready to deal with Milosevic and declares itself ready, instead,to deal with Serbia." Woollacott noted that Arbour's words in the Hague, whileunderscoring the independence of the tribunal, "suggested quite directly thatthe timing of the indictment had been affected by the disclosure ofintelligence by certain countries. The control by the United States and Britainof intercepts and other secret information has always meant that the war crimescard could be played at a moment they deemed would best serve theirinterests."            InParis, Le Monde ,welcoming the indictment as an important new step "in the fight againstimpunity and barbarism," said Arbour had acted with full independence andfreedom, but this view was questioned south of the Alps. In Corriere della Sera ofMilan, the 90-year-old columnist Indro Montanelli, one of Italy's mostinfluential journalists, said he hoped it wasn't so, for this would mean thatthe tribunal had deliberately timed the indictment to sabotage peacenegotiations. While British papers were expressing the hope that it would leadto the overthrow of Milosevic by the Serbs, Montanelli predicted the opposite.So did Libration of Paris, which said in an editorial thatPresident Jacques Chirac's call Thursday for an internal coup against Milosevicwas most unlikely to come about. Le Figaro also said that to think the Serbs would now deserttheir leader showed "a deep misunderstanding of the psychology of a peoplewhich considers itself persecuted and besieged." Writing from Belgrade forLa Repubblicaof Rome, Bernardo Valli reported that despite Milosevic's unpopularity and lackof charisma, he now appears to have the country behind him.
