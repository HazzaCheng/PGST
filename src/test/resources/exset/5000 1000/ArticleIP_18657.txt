                                 Religious Persecution            The chief coach of theEnglish national soccer team was fired Tuesday amid huge controversy over hiseccentric religious beliefs. Glenn Hoddle, the man who steered the English teamto failure in last year's World Cup in France, told the Times of London in aninterview that disabled people were disabled because of things they had donewrong in previous lives. This created political uproar and sharply divided theBritish press about whether or not he should be allowed to keep his job. TheFootball Association, soccer's ruling body, fired him after he refused to severconnections with Eileen Drewery, a faith healer.            In an editorialWednesday, the Times said Hoddle had to go because "he had failed toseparate his rights of free speech from his duties as one of the mostinfluential men in a game with vast influence over the life of Britain." Butthe DailyTelegraph criticized his dismissal, saying Hoddle's views on thedisabled were shared by millions of Hindus and Buddhists around the world. Thestory was big across Europe, especially in the Italian papers, which ran it ontheir front pages. "Fired for Karma" was the headline in La Repubblica of Rome,which said he was perhaps the first person in Europe's 2000 th yearto lose his job for his religious convictions.            The Daily Telegraph reported on its front pageWednesday that MI6, the British external espionage service, was having toconsider withdrawing its man in Prague after Czech newspapers identified him asa homosexual living in the city with another man. Christopher Hurran, whosecover had been acting as a counselor at the British Embassy, was exposed by theCzech security service, BIS, after he made a written complaint about the headof the BIS, Karel Vulterin, who was fired by the Czech government as aresult.            "The letter that led toMr. Vulterin's dismissal is believed to have followed leaks from within the BISrevealing a successful MI6 operation in which Iraq's leading spymaster in theregion defected to the West," the newspaper said. This was Jabir Salim, head ofMukhabarrat operations in Eastern Europe, who disappeared before Christmas,telling colleagues at the Iraqi embassy in Prague that his daughter neededurgent medical treatment in neighboring Austria. An interesting revelation inthe report was that the British intelligence services, which previouslyexcluded homosexuals for security reasons, no longer see them as a risk if theyare open about their sexuality.            There was anger in Jordan Tuesday over suggestions inIsrael that Jordan might now need Israeli "protection" against Syria or otherArab neighbors, who might seek to exploit King Hussein's illness to destabilizethe country. A Jordanian official was quoted in the pan-Arab Al Hayat as saying, "Jordandoes not sense any danger threatening its security or stability from Syria orany other Arab party." The kingdom "has always been and continues to be capableof defending itself against any threat regardless of its source orobjective."            In Japan, AsahiShimbun quoted sources as saying that "the government and the rulingcoalition parties decided Tuesday there is no constitutional prohibitionagainst private companies transporting U.S. weapons, munitions and militarypersonnel in emergency situations around Japan." This cleared a major hurdle inthe revision by the Japanese parliament of the U.S.-Japan defense cooperationagreement, the paper said.            In Russia, Izvestia reportedWednesday on a ruling by the Constitutional Court that nobody should besentenced to death again until all citizens are guaranteed the right to trialby jury. But the paper commented that legislators might decide that, inRussia's current economic circumstances, it is too expensive to provide juriesto all the country's courts and that therefore capital punishment should bebanned altogether.
