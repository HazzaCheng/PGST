                                 Annan-omous Threat                           USAToday , the Washington Post , and the New York Timeslead with the U.N. Security Council's OK of the weapons inspection deal agreedto last week by Kofi Annan and Saddam Hussein. The Los AngelesTimes goes with President Clinton's criticism of the congressionalmovement towards a radical overhaul of the tax code.            The Security Council voted 15-0 to approve the Annan deal, which opens upeight of Saddam's presidential sites to U.N. inspectors. The papers report thatdebate focused mainly on what would happen if Saddam reneges. The U.S. andBritain wanted the Council to authorize automatic military action as part ofthe accord, while other member countries, led by France, Russia, and China, didnot. In the end, there was no mention of automatic military moves, but merely awarning of "the severest consequences." USAT and the WP stressthe U.N.'s warning, while the NYT stresses the U.S. failure to getinclusion of an automatic attack. Despite this difference, everybody reportsthat the U.S. position is that it doesn't need further approval for a strike ifthe deal is abrogated.            The Post reports that the U.N.'s resolution reiterates the intentionto consider ending the economic sanctions on Iraq once its weapons of massdestruction have been eliminated. This news seems too important to leave to thelast paragraph, though.            The LAT lead reports on a speech President Clinton gave Mondayin which he denounced the current vogue for wiping out the U.S. tax code infavor of a radically new system. Clinton called the approach "misguided,reckless and irresponsible," warning that it could imperil the economy. "No oneconcerned about fighting crime would even think about saying, 'Well, threeyears from now we're going to throw out the criminal code and we'll figure outwhat to put in its place,'" the paper quotes Clinton as saying. "But that isexactly what some people in Congress are proposing to do."            This sounds like an important story--Zeitgeist and president on collisioncourse over taxes. Why then does the WP put it on p. 5, and theNYT national edition bury it on p. 15?            A Wall Street Journal editorial on Internet taxationtakes the position that Bill Clinton is right to support a sales taxmoratorium, and Trent Lott wrong to oppose it, because the Internet is "thebusiness infrastructure of the future," and hence its growth shouldn't be"stifled" by taxes. Along the way, the editorial asks a fun tax question: "If aman in California buys a birthday present for his mother in Illinois from acompany located in Georgia, in which state did the transaction take place?"            Today's appearance of Vernon Jordan before the Starr grand jury getsfront-page coverage at the WP and a "Politics and Policy" piece at theWSJ . USAT uses the occasion to do an informativefront-page primer on grand juries. The Tony Mauro/Kevin Johnson effortreviews such basics as that the lawyers of those summoned have to wait outsideand that grand jurors can pose questions. There are also the nuggets thatEngland did away with grand juries fifty years ago and that in Hawaii they havetheir own lawyer as a counterbalance to the prosecutor. And there's this grandjuror's question to Sidney Blumenthal during his appearance last week: "Do youbelieve the public should be fully informed about the character of thepresident?" Blumenthal's answer: "Yes, I do."            In a WP front-page interview, Bill Gates says, referringto the Justice Department's lawsuit, "If we can't innovate in our products,then you know we will be replaced." The paper is struck by how far Gates'behavior is from "the usual cautious demeanor of business leaders visitingWashington," and finds him "roaring with indignation and disdain for those whoquestion his business practices."            One of the key causes of press overkill of the sort we're now witnessing inl'affaire Lewinsky is the papers' tendencies to do stories aboutanything that has to do with Topic A, even if it would otherwise meritvirtually no news play. A good example is found in today's LAT "Column One" feature, which tells us that Walt Whitman,"the poet of democracy, the poet of the body and soul," commands a loyal andexpansive following, and quotes a talking head from USC to drive home thepoint. The real reason for the piece isn't revealed until the fifth paragraph:Whitman's book Leaves of Grass "has a cameo in the investigationinvolving President Clinton and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky."What's next--a "Column One" about Leo Rosten and the history of "schmucko"?
