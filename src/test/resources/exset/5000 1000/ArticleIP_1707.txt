                                             The International HeraldTribune, in a front-page article from Singapore by MichaelRichardson, reported that the fierce austerity programs being demanded ofAsian countries by the International Monetary Fund "could ignite virulentanti-Americanism" and "create dangerous instability in Asia." But it was Asianleaders, not the Americans, who seemed for the moment to be taking thestrain.            TheSouth China Morning Posttalked of "unprecedented diplomatic pressure" being imposed on the increasinglyinsecure President Suharto of Indonesia, who, it said, was awaiting furtherfrantic, bossy telephone calls (following those he had already received fromPresident Clinton and Prime Minister John Howard of Australia) from JapanesePrime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. TheGuardian of Londondevoted its editorial Monday to demanding Suharto's resignation.            The maineditorial of the Manila Times was devoted, on the other hand, to congratulatingthe president of the Philippines, Fidel V. Ramos, for canceling a planned tripto Switzerland and Belgium. But the congratulations contained more than a hintof sarcasm. The trip would have been his 34 th abroad during his 67months in office, the newspaper said; and "[o]n every trip, the President--withthe First Lady on occasion--brings with him at least a hundred official,security and personal staff, as befits the powers and responsibilities of hisoffice."            That wasnot counting the inevitable "business delegation" composed of representativesof government-owned financial institutions and companies, the ManilaTimes added, pointing out that "every single presidential aide or factotumgets $2,000 in allowance for a trip," meaning "$200,000 going down the drainfor allowances alone," on top of which there were the air fares, hotel bills,rented cars and communications equipment, phone bills, "etcetera."            "He [the president] might have thought ... thatcanceling his trip could send the wrong signals to the world that we are goingunder. Possibly so. Or worse, they might think we have slid down to utterpoverty, we can't even finance our chief executive's voyages overseas," thenewspaper continued.            "What, wepoor? In the days of the Aquino administration, there was one official in factwho--to justify his purchase of electric massage pillows--had the temerity tosay 'we are a rich country pretending to be poor.' For a long while it did seemlike we, the people, were consigned to endure poverty, while our leaderswallowed in assumed wealth at our expense. The President has shown a fineexample."            In the continuing Algerian crisis, the London Sundaynewspaper the Observer made waves across Europe by claiming that "atleast some of the massacres in Algeria are the work of the regime's militarysecurity force." "Two policemen seeking asylum in Britain told theObserver they took part in massacres and torture of defencelesscivilians, under orders," the newspaper said. "The defectors said specialforces disguised as 'fundamentalists' with beards and Muslim dress slaughteredentire families in the middle of the night."            In France, where the troublein its former colony continued to occupy many newspaper-column inches, theprincipal Paris morning paper, the conservative Le Figaro, carried an interviewwith the leader of the Algerian Islamic party (FIS) that won the 1991 Algerianelection, only to see the result quashed and its members jailed for five years.Abdelkader Hachani condemned the massacres as "crimes against humanity" andsaid that, by rejecting a political solution and refusing to protect thepopulation, "the government bears a large part of the responsibility."            In its weekend edition,Le Monde carried afront-page article about "the incredible record of the South Africanprison system," from which 700 prisoners have escaped in the past two monthsalone. This was not so surprising, it said, when it was taken into accountthat, "according to official statistics, 10,000 public order officials havebeen charged with crimes and offences of various kinds since January 1996, andthat, according to a recent opinion poll, the majority of South Africans nolonger have either respect for or confidence in their police."
