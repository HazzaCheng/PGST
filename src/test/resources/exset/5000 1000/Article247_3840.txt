                                 You Auto Know            Both the Los Angeles Times and New York Timeslead with the first moves of Pakistan's new military leader: his announcementof a unilateral pull-back of troops from India's border and the establishmentof a combined military-civilian council to run the country. The Washington Post fronts Pakistan but goes instead with thehard line the White House is taking with Congress on spending (made clear bystaffers on Sunday chat shows), which will include President Clinton's vetotoday of a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill and his refusal to sign other keymoney bills until Republicans assure the protection of the Social Securitysurplus. USAToday plays Pakistan on Page 8 and leads with the changing taste of carthieves. According to an insurance industry report out today, while the HondaAccord and Toyota Camry remain the cars most often stolen, pickups, minivans,and SUVs are moving up fast. The story also reports that BMWs and MercedesBenzes are not prime theft targets (there aren't enough people in the marketfor them), and that car theft has been trending down since 1991. Nobody elsefronts the USAT or WP leads.            The WP off-lead is slugged "HIS TERM FADING, A WISTFUL CLINTONLOOSENS UP," but it doesn't really deliver much about President Clinton's innerthoughts. With these possible exceptions: 1) Clinton remains concerned aboutwhat he believes is Al Gore's troubled campaign organization, and 2) Forseveral months after the impeachment trial, an air of sadness hung over Clinton(or so says one unnamed former adviser).                           USAT and the LAT front stories about the latest FBI crime statistics, released yesterday. TheUSAT effort emphasizes the drop in the murder rate--6.3 per 100,000Americans, the lowest since LBJ was president. The LAT stresses the dropin juvenile crime--although its discussion seems to take a leap since the storymostly reports on declining numbers of juvenile arrests and hence doesn'taddress the possibility that increasing numbers of juveniles are committingcrimes but just aren't getting caught. An inside NYT story goes highwith the drop in gun-related felonies. And the inside WP piece dwellsmostly on the absence of a clear explanation for these decreases, while alsonoting two retrograde movements: There hasn't been a significant crime dropamong white suburban and rural teen-agers, and cities between 10,000 and 24,999have experienced a murder increase.                           USAT uses its front-page "cover story" to go long with a flight safety piece:about how the failure of a radar-based altitude warning system was probably thecause of four air crashes (total death toll: 246) that federal investigatorshave been attributing to pilot error. The story says that the system has failedwidely, including along some of the nation's busiest airport approachpaths.            A WP story makes a powerful case for wondering why the U.S. isbacking a peace accord in Sierra Leone that provides a general amnesty forrebel war criminals and indeed, will put eight of them in the country'scabinet. After all, notes the Post , the rebels there routed 2 millionpeople from their homes--twice as many as in Kosovo--and are ultimatelyresponsible for the deaths of 20,000. And why, pray tell, is this story on Page13? Was that story on the Post front about how some commuters actuallylike to commute really more important?            In a Wall Street Journal commentary, Sen. Jesse Helms defendsthe Senate's defeat of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. His keyclaim: Nuclear arms are coming into the hands of more and more countries notbecause of the absence of such a treaty but because of the Clintonadministration's failed nonproliferation policies. "This administration," Helmswrites, "in its shameful effort to curry favor with Silicon Valley executives,has loosened export controls on supercomputers, putting them in Russian nuclearweapons factories. The administration has decontrolled satellite launches,helping China improve its nuclear missile force. The administration has lookedthe other way as Russia has been repeatedly caught assisting both Iran and Iraqin their drive to build weapons of mass destruction."            A WP item mentions in passing that since 1990 Bill Moyers has beendrawing $200,000 a year from an organization trying to change campaign financelaws, which Moyers describes as having turned politics into "an arms race formoney." Here in a nutshell is the difference between a politician and ajournalist: If a politician tries to get money out of politics, it's a careerrisk. If a journalist does, it's a career.
