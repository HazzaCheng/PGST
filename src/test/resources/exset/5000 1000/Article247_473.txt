                                 Freeh-for-all                           USAToday and the Los Angeles Times lead with new congressional pressure onthe Department of Justice regarding campaign fund-raising investigations. TheNew York Timesleads with the changing role of the International Monetary Fund. And theWashington Post leads with President Clinton'sappearance at a Washington, D.C. church during which he called for greaterindependence for the District, remarks criticized by many local politicians fornot including a call for voting rights for the city.                           USAT reports that Rep. Dan Burton says that his investigatingcommittee may have to cite Janet Reno for contempt if she doesn't turn over amemo written to her by FBI director Louis Freeh. In it, to no avail, Freehexplained why she should appoint an independent counsel to look into Clintoncampaign fund-raising. And USAT and the LAT report that Sen.Orrin Hatch plans on asking Freeh to open up his own investigation of thesematters independent of Reno's. Meanwhile, says USAT , Sen. Fred Thompsonwill ask Justice to consider perjury charges against at least six witnesses whotestified at his fund-raising hearings this past summer. The WP also hasa front-page piece concerning these developments.            The NYT lead points out that last week's IMF bailout package forSouth Korea is the latest example of how the Fund is pushing deeper than ever into the day-to-dayoperations of the economies it aids. Chastened by compliance difficultiessurrounding recent IMF loans to Russia and Indonesia, says the paper, for theKorea bailout, Fund officials won concessions to many detailed provisionscovering the cronyish connections among the government and the country's majorindustrial conglomerates.            The Wall Street Journal 's lead feature notes that the latest global economicdevelopments challenge the widely-held view that an emphasis on short-termperformance weakens an economy. The piece claims that the U.S.'s strong growthin the 1990s and the collapse of one long-term-oriented Asian financial system(where, unlike here, banks and not financial markets are the primary source ofcapital) after another show quite the contrary. Another WSJ front-pagepiece notes that while the current economic differential between the U.S. andthe leading Asian economies will amp our trade deficit somewhat, few think theAsian crisis will derail America's current economic expansion--because theother major legs of the economy, like consumer confidence, business profits andgovernment expenditures, are robust.            The NYT runs a front-page interview-based piece on President Clinton , thefollow-on to a presidential chat piece that ran yesterday. The Sunday effortdwelt on the personal side of Clinton's life nowadays: his knee injury, hishearing aids, his love of golf, his empty nest. Today's installment concernsdomestic policy, specifically the series of modest initiatives he has puttogether since failing to sell wholesale health care reform. Among thepiecemeal efforts the Times lauds are insuring overnight hospital staysfor new mothers, school uniforms, cell phones for citizen neighborhood patrols,keeping liquor ads off the airwaves, restricting tobacco sales, creating anational registry for sex offenders, and suspending the driver's licenses ofdeadbeat dads.            Amid all the hand-wringing (especially on the sports pages) about whetherLatrell Sprewell has been dealt with too harshly comes the voice of reason inthe form of a letter to the NYT , which points out that if Sprewellhad a real job, he'd be looking at permanent unemployment and criminalprosecution.            Al Kamen's WP column looks into a complaint that California congressmanBill Thomas was recently spotted driving like a jerk on Capitol Hill. In thecourse of his investigation, Kamen learns that Thomas has a Porsche and a BMW,which causes him to ask exactly the right question: "Just how big was that lastraise for Congress?"
