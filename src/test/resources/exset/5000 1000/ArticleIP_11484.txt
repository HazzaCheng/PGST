                                 The President of the United States Stands Naked            The impeachment ofPresident Clinton dominated front pages around the world this weekend.Britain's SundayTimes called for Clinton's resignation, saying that the spectacle of atrial in the Senate would subvert "America's responsibilities as the world'sonly superpower." Meanwhile, the right-wing Spanish newspaper ABC applauded impeachment because it illustrated "the fact that even[the president] is subject to political machinery of rare democraticperfection."            Where the SundayTimes suggested that Rep. Bob Livingston's resignation "shows Mr Clintonthe way," an editorial in the Age of Melbourne, Australia, called it "a bizarrepolitical gift" to the president. Livingston's act "instantly blurred theRepublican argument that the President's impeachment is based on the issue oflies and the law rather than sex. ... Mr Livingston's resignation unleashes thespectre of a political system convulsed by regular revelations of sexualaffairs and demands from the Republican's [sic] religious right forsexual purity."            Australia's Sydney Morning Herald presented the weekend's events as "the logical conclusion to thelate-20 th century drama which has been quietly corroding the oldcertainties of political power throughout the world's mature democracies. ...That is, when the personal really is political, not merely a feministcatchcry, and when new technologies and competition are driving the media todeliver unparalleled, all-news-all-the-time access to the lives of those inpower, we should not be too surprised to see a US President on the brink oflosing his job for having an affair."            In Britain, theIndependent on Sunday , which called Clinton "a shallow, fawning mountebank, and a man whoseserial adultery might be overlooked more easily but for his serial mendacity,"was just as hard on his Republican foes. It said, "The party of Lincoln andEisenhower seems to have been possessed by a zeal which is less 'republican' or'conservative' than Maoist. These people will not be happy until they haveinflicted ritual humiliation on Clinton in the spirit of the CulturalRevolution." An editorial in Sunday's Jerusalem Post concurred, describing the impeachmentdebate as "a disgraceful partisan spectacle, an act of vengeance rather thanjustice, a triumph for the fundamentalist Christian Right that will hauntRepublicans for a long time."            Clinton's comment last week that attacking Iraq during theMuslim holy month of Ramadan would be "offensive" drew several responses. InBritain, the Times said that the "considerate gesture ... is like anyhiatus in hostilities, a backhanded concession to the victim: a heartybreakfast for a condemned man." In Lebanon, an editorial in Saturday's Daily Star suggested that the strikes would have beenmore effective if they had been made after Ramadan ended and predicted that "itnow seems likely that the strikes will have to be suspended for about a monthwhile devout Muslims take leave of food and drink during daylight hours and Mr.Clinton continues to take leave of his senses at all hours. Having beensupplied with so much notice, Saddam will then be able to make good use of thatmonth to conceal or destroy whatever the U.S. and Britain failed to eliminate."(For more on the etiquette of fighting during Ramadan, see                  Slate               's"Explainer.")            Britain's involvement in the Iraqi airstrikesearned it little more than condemnation and condescension. A Sunday op-edcolumn in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretzsaid that the "British mobilization ... helps London more than it helpsWashington. Prime Minister Tony Blair, who contributed a symbolic squadron ofTornado bombers to Clinton, is only signaling that the Americans are notalone." Writing in Canada's new national newspaper the National Post Saturday,Mark Steyn observed that the U.S. media coverage of the strikes barelymentioned Britain's participation: "This is the thanks a chap gets forproviding the most naked of presidents with his only international figleaf."            An editorialin Sunday's InternationalHerald Tribune , headlined "Britain's Slavish Devotion to America,"claims that Britain's tendency to ally itself so closely with the United Statesreflects the country's inability to reconcile itself with Europe. Instead theBritish have attempted "to stay on the world stage by associating themselveswith U.S. global supremacy. The United States finds them useful and is toopolite to tell London how little weight it carries in the world. The Germans,French, even Italians and Spaniards, may say so. But they do not say it inEnglish. So Britain does not hear."
