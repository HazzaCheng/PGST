                                 The Future of Family Feuds            The LosAngeles Times leads with a local story: A study shows that California'shigh-tech boom is disproportionately benefiting the rich and, consequently,widening the state's income gap. The Washington Post leads with a preview of the upcomingSupreme Court arguments over the constitutionality of state statutes thatguarantee visitation rights to grandparents. The LAT 's off-leadconcludes that the case, Troxel vs. Granville , will define thegovernment's future role in family affairs. The Troxels, assisted bygovernmental groups and the AARP, argue that courts should be allowed tomandate grandparental visitation rights to protect the welfare of minors. Theirson's widow contends that court-mandated visitation infringes on parentalprivacy. Her position is echoed by traditional religious groups and civillibertarians.            The New York Times leads with Democraticworries that the Republican Party will enjoy as much as a four-to-one softmoney spending advantage in the coming election. Democratic Senatorial CampaignCommittee chairman Sen. Robert G. Torricelli projects that the Democrats willraise less than $30 million. Torricelli says the GOP could garner $200 million.The Democratic National Committee's campaign purse is currently one-fourth thesize of the Republican Party's roughly $10 million war chest. The DNC's failureto amass cash is attributed to its lack of a finance chair, donors' doubtsabout the party's presidential prospects, and the dissipation of PresidentClinton's fund-raising power. Party patriarchs fret that Republicans will buryDemocratic candidates under an avalanche of expensive TV ads. The Timespoints out that the Democrats' public pouting could be an attempt to stimulatefund raising.            The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is flush with cash, reportsthe Post in an inside item. The DCCC enters 2000 with more money thanthe Republican Congressional Committee. House Democrats collected more than $33million in 1999 and still have $19 million left. House Republicans raised $48million but spent all but about $10 million.            The NYT and the Post front John McCain's release of more than500 letters that he sent to federal agencies under the jurisdiction of acommittee he chairs. A reefered piece in the LAT emphasizes that thedocument dump is an attempt to defuse the controversy over McCain's efforts onbehalf of campaign contributor Paxson Communications. McCain, who received$20,000 and the use of a corporate jet from Paxson affiliates, encouraged theFederal Communications Commission to issue a ruling on the company'sacquisition of a broadcast station. The Post underscores that McCainalso intervened to assist BellSouth, which contributed plane rides and $60,000to his political fortunes.            "Generally the letters simply urged speeded-up action rather than anyspecific outcome," according to the WP . (Chatterboxargues that there is nothing wrong with a senator urging an agency to actpromptly.) McCain claims only 15 letters sought help for entities thatcontributed more than $2,000 to his presidential coffers, but the Timespoints out that the campaign's count may exclude letters written to aid Senatecampaign contributors and lobbyists. A Post piece reports that mostvoters are unaware of the recent hullabaloo over regulatory correspondence.            A NYT front-pager explains why the Y2K threat fizzled. The World Bankand the State Department forecasted significant disruption in countries likeRussia, but the experts prognosticated on the basis of poor data. Theyunderestimated last-minute preparations and overestimated "technologydependence." A WP "Outlook" piece attributes the undue unease to goodold-fashion fear of technology.            A LAT front-pager laments the explosion of test-gaming by privilegedcollege-bound kids. The number of students who enjoy "special accommodations"on the SAT, including extra time, rose by more than 50 percent in "recentyears." Most of the growth in learning disability adjustments, which schoolsapprove based on a doctor's note or psychologist's recommendation, comes fromritzy prep and public schools. "Hundreds and perhaps thousands" of kids aretaking advantage of the system.            The Times fronts Manhattan's latest absurdity--co-op pet vetting. Theluxury apartment market is so overheated that dozens of co-ops have begun toscreen the pets of potential owners. Boards evaluate pet size, pedigree,training, demeanor, and appearance. Real estate agencies prepare dogbiographies for board evaluation. Owners administer Valium to calm theircanines before co-op scrutiny.
