Randy'sWrap-Up                        It is instinctive to reject a patriotic list ofOfficial Enemies.

It might, however, be possible to resist the grossest forms of jingoism.Consider how badly certain World War II songs have aged--"I'm Going To SlapThat Dirty Little Jap." And those wartime Warner Bros. cartoons where BugsBunny battles grotesque caricatures of the Japanese--they don't quite holdup.
