                                 Creatine Trouble            The crisis in Russia leads at all papers--the New YorkTimes , the Washington Post , and the Los Angeles Times --though the WP tucks thestory under a banner headline on market dives and global turmoil. Eachfront-page features a photo of Boris Yeltsin, his hands raised, defiantlyrefuting rumors of his resignation. In Yeltsin's words: "I'm not going toresign . . . In 2000, there will be an election for president, and I will notrun." But Yeltsin's determined words belie his weak physical appearance andwaning power. The papers note that an agreement reached Friday to shiftsubstantial power away from the presidency and over to the parliament (theState Duma) constitutes a likely setback for reform. The LAT is the onlypaper with high-up mention of Yeltsin's latest sackings: Anatoly Chubias(Russia's envoy to international financial institutions) and deputy primeminister Boris Nemtsov.            All papers run above-the-fold stories recapping Wall Street's worst weekthis year (and the worst week since October '89). The Dow dropped 114 pointsFriday, extending Thursday's 357-point dive. Asia's markets also droppedsharply on Friday, with Tokyo dipping to a 12-year low. In Russia the economyremained virtually frozen--stocks were traded at very low volume Friday, andMoscow's main currency exchange stayed shut.            Next week's Yeltsin-Clinton summit in Moscow gets front-page play at theLAT and gets inside features elsewhere. The WP predicts thesummit will yield "psychic solace but little tangible assistance." NewtGingrich for one foresees no psychic solace: he tells the NYT thatClinton's trip is "imprudent" considering Russia's current state. The chaoscertainly makes trip logistics a nightmare, as all papers note. Interestingangle not mentioned in the papers: What is the status of securitypreparations?            All papers report (the NYT inside) that a second suspect in theAfrican bombings, arraigned in a court in New York, has admitted ties toterrorist financier Osama bin Laden. A related WP front-pager says thatbin Laden was in the Afghanistan camps the day of the attack, but moved beforethe missiles struck. The story also says that the U.S. began formulatingretaliation plans against bin Laden's Afghan stronghold in June.            A NYT front-page story keeps up the heat on U.S. officials whomaintain that the Sudanese pharmaceutical plant was a legitimate target. Thearticle chronicles numerous U.S. changes-of-story. It also says that PresidentClinton "personally chose the bombing site [in Sudan] . . . declining to strikeany other among a larger set of targets presented to him by military planners."The article adds that Clinton may not have known that the plant was aU.N.-affiliated medicine factory.            President Clinton's speech at a Martha's Vineyard church makes the frontpage at the NYT and the WP . While not alluding directly to theLewinsky scandal, Clinton emphasizes forgiveness. (He also compares himself toNelson Mandela in needing to forgive tormentors.) Clinton's audience is largelysympathetic.            A WP "Style" section piece says that British newspapers still carryon in "all-out wretched-excess mode" about Princess Diana, almost a year afterher death. However, some editors dare to predict that this may be thePrincess's last media hurrah. Supporting evidence: 300 people showed up to acommemorative march last weekend when 15,000 were expected. Counter-evidence:London's Daily Mail netted 20% more readers when it serialized Diana,the Untold Story .            A mock-epic on the NYT op-ed page replays the Trojan War as asteroid-aided battle, a la the controversy over Mark McGwire's use ofover-the-counter muscle-builders. The wily Odysseus slips Achilles someandrostenedione, while Apollo stokes the Trojan defenders on creatine. Allcontenders show the requisite deference toward Anabolis, the goddess ofsteroids.
