                                 Genocide Chat            The New York Times ,Washington Post , and Los AngelesTimes lead with President Clinton's remark that the United Statesshould have done something quickly about the 1994 killings of half a millionpeople in Rwanda and having failed to do so, must share in the blame for them.USAToday goes with the developing story of the Arkansas schoolyardshootings, which also gets a lot of coverage on the other fronts.            Clinton's acknowledgement came during an emotionally charged stop at theKigali airport during which he and Hillary listened to the wrenchingrecollections of massacre survivors. Given the prior day's discussion of thewrongs of slavery, Clinton's remarks about the Rwandan genocide indicate, saysthe WP , that his African sojourn is becoming a "contrition tour." But, points out the Post ,yesterday's statement was different--with it, Clinton is referring to anepisode that occurred during his own administration. The paper points out thatClinton suggested yesterday that one obstacle to taking action at the time wasa lack of credible information about what was actually going on. The paper alsonotes that some human rights activists responded that there was ample reliableinformation, just not ample White House will.            The NYT reports that in his mea culpa du jour, Clinton also cited Bosnia as another example on his watch where the reaction toethnic killing was too slow. The Times does a good job of supplyingspecifics on the U.S. inaction in Rwanda, noting that the Clintonadministration blocked a UN on-the-ground effort that "might have savedhundreds of thousands of lives."            Both the NYT and USAT Clinton-on-Rwanda pieces note apolitical factor that at the time inhibited U.S. action, but which Clintondidn't mention: Public support for U.S. involvement in peacekeeping missionsevaporated just prior to the Rwanda situation when 18 U.S. soldiers were killedin an ambush in Somalia.            The headline over the LAT 's Rwanda coverage is not a good model."Rwandans Told World Shares Guilt for Genocide" doesn't mention by whom, aparticularly oversight when the whom is the prez.            The USAT lead states that the two Arkansas suspects--age 13 and11--will be tried as juveniles. The NYT says their extreme youth meansconviction might result in sentences of just a few years. The LAT frontcarries a piece about a new category of criminal suggested by such cases--the"fledgling psychopath."            A NYT op-ed says the incident implicates the too-ready accessyoung people have to guns. (They were apparently stolen from one of the boys'grandfathers, but, notes the Times , in Arkansas it is perfectly legalfor an 11-year-old to own a rifle or shotgun.) And a WP editorialreports, "The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S. children aged lessthan 15 was nearly 12 times higher than among children in the other 25industrialized countries combined."            According to the Wall Street Journal , Jesse Jackson, who is accompanyingPresident Clinton on his African trip in his role as special envoy to Africa,may have found his niche. Some in the foreign policy community, says theJournal , which on the whole was wary of his appointment, already feelJackson is proving useful. For instance, on the current trip Clinton followedJackson's advice and had a lengthy phone conversation with the president ofLiberia to make sure he didn't feel snubbed because Clinton wasn't visiting hiscountry.            Back to the Arkansas shootings for a sec: The papers, having learned thesuspects' names from school sources, opt to use them rather than invoking theusual juvenile court practice of anonymity. "Today's Papers" would beinterested in finding out the general policy of the papers on such matters: Dothey print the names of juveniles whenever they learn them? Or only when thecrimes they're charged with are very serious?
