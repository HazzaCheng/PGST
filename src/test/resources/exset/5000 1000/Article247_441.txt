                                 Hear Them Roar            The Washington Post leads with the black women's march inPhiladelphia. The New York Timesleads with a House committee's condemnation of the Pentagon's handling of GulfWar veterans' medical problems. The Los AngelesTimes 's lead is a report that the U.S. strategy of isolating Iran andIraq from the world community is failing as our allies' desire to make businessdeals weakens their support.            The WP summarizes the rally's agenda: investigation of the CIA's rolein "allowing black communities to be flooded with crack cocaine," programs tohelp women prisoners make the transition back to society, the establishment ofblack independent schools, and the release of political prisoners. Indiscussing crowd size, the Post uses as a reference the size of theMillion Man March, but, curiously, doesn't refer to the Promise Keepers rallyof a few weeks back--even though the paper gave PK massive front-pagecoverage.            The rally coverage signifies an odd new journalism trend. In their extensivefront-page coverage, the Post , the NYT , and the LATdutifully report the size of the rally as "hundreds of thousands," yet theyeach persist in referring to the event as the "Million Woman March," apparentlybecause that's what the organizers called it. So look for the Pentagon to callits next use of force "Operation Only Objected to by Draft-Dodging Reporters,"and don't be surprised when next summer's would-be blockbuster is called "TheBest Movie You'll Ever See." (Question for William Safire: Why isn't it"Million Wom e n March" anyway?)            The NYT lead is written off a copy it has obtained of a Housecommittee's report to be released this coming week that says the DefenseDepartment and the Department of Veterans Affairs should be stripped of theirauthority over Gulf soldiers' sickness because of their mishandling of theissue. The report states that Congress should either create or designate anagency to take over. The paper also reveals that a separate forthcoming studyby a White House panel will be nearly as critical of the DOD.            Last week, the WP ran a front-page story about the problems underwelfare reform faced by a woman fresh off the rolls whose 15-year-old daughterhas had two babies in rapid succession. The story was accompanied by afront-page picture of the daughter sucking her thumb and staring blankly attelevision while holding one of her kids. That picture has drawn a firestorm ofprotest from readers, many of them black women. Now, the Postdistinguishes itself by being the only paper covered here that has an ombudsmanwho writes a regular column, and today she takes up the issue and concludesthat "deciding not to put that picture where we did would have better servedthe truth." Avoiding the truth is more like it--the Post didn't turn onthe TV or tell the girl to suck her thumb.            In the run-up to Jiang Zemin's visit, there is a lot of China action today.The WP , in a story about American-based Chinese political exiles, runsthe following precis of China's recent human rights record: "After theTiananmen Square crackdown, a decade of public political debate in China cameto an end. Hundreds if not thousands of demonstrators died. Hundreds werejailed, and scores of dissidents fled abroad....Most [had been] beaten ortortured. All have seen family members harassed, even persecuted to death."Today at least, the NYT seems fixed on looking the other way. It runs anop-ed piece about China that asserts "while individuals and special-interestgroups are free to give human rights absolute and unqualified priority,governments are not," and which reports that "the number of political prisonersin China currently is 3,000--which is 0.00023 percent of the total population."Meanwhile, a Times front-page piece details how Jiang loves to breakinto song and play the piano and recite poetry, all of which, says the paper,"points to an unpredictable, wacky side." (Homework assignment: find a singlefront-page piece in the entire history of the NYT emphasizing Hitler'sfondness for animals and children.) "Oh, Jiang," says one student protester toanother, "stop with the wacky stunts, with the piano, with the poetry. You'rekilling us here."
