Randy's Wrap-Up                        Sadly, all 32 major TVnetworks rejected my pitch for America Loses Its Innocence Again for theVery First Time , the story of a surprisingly corrupt game-show contestant(whose suburban life is not nearly as sans souci as the brochure wouldhave you believe) who is exiled from his own personal Eden when 60Minutes refuses to broadcast an interview that proves--proves!--that thepresident lied to the entire country about this minister (a man of God!) whoturns out to have had sex with a dog, like maybe a golden retriever (unlessthings turn around and I get to do it at Fox in which case the dog will be achimp, but that makes sense dramatically) who can't keep a secret (see, it's atalking dog), but it takes this big check from some tabloid where they JUSTMAKE THINGS UP(!) and then the check bounces--did I mention that the dog wasmarried, and yet he betrayed his vows? The scales have fallen from my eyes,boy: All those networks care about is ratings. Bastards.
