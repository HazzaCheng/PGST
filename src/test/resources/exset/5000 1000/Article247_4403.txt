                                 Masculinity, That Fragile Flower            JAN. 17 (APE)--The boom in business media is damaging male self-esteem, anew study shows.            The study's findings were unveiled yesterday at a news conference in lowerManhattan co-hosted by MALE, the Men's Association for Label Evaluation, anorganization devoted to challenging negative stereotypes of men, and the twopsychologists who performed the research. The psychologists, Dr. Eric Smith andDr. Adam Cohen of New York University, interviewed 500 American men between theages of 15 and 45 over a period of five years.            "It's a wake-up call," said Dr. Smith of the results. "We are losing ourbrightest young men to a devastating disorder. They are squandering theirenormous potential for growth and personal happiness on a meaningless obsessionwith dot-coms, bandwidth, relative net worth, and the fleeting indices ofsuccess, such as stock overvaluation."            The study suggests that some men may be so affected by the proliferation ofbusiness television and financial services magazines that they fall prey towhat Smith and Cohen call an obsessional disorder. Said Smith, "They binge andpurge, or rather, purge then binge. Because they feel worthless, they punishthemselves by coming in too early to the office and staying too late, whetherthey need to or not. Then they waste time on endless day trading and depletetheir bank accounts on frivolous items--watches, suits, cell phones with Webbrowsers, huge bouquets they'll send to girlfriends alienated by their longhours and tedious business gossip, even though the girlfriends will just throwthe flowers in the garbage."            The periods in a man's life when he is most vulnerable to the condition,according to Smith and Cohen, are "troughs"--moments of transition, such asleaving high school and entering college, leaving college and entering the jobmarket, hitting 30, and so on. In a trough, a man may develop an emotionalattachment to "aspirational media," which traffic in celebratory stories andphotographs of highly powerful men and the symbols of their success, such asthe corporate titles they have acquired and shed, the venture capital theyhaven't spent yet, and the wives they have married and divorced.            These publications and programs also contain how-tos about getting richquickly and yet investing wisely that may make readers feel confused andinadequate, said Smith and Cohen. "For instance," said Cohen, holding up thecurrent issue of Fortune magazine turned to an article by columnistStanley Bing, "he humorously dismisses the typical New Year's resolutions, thenpledges to 'make a lot of money.' It's role models like him that are layingwaste to an entire generation of men who could have had richly nurturingrelationships with their spouses and friends and gone on to be perfectly happyand productive professionals with children in progressive schools and summerrentals in western Massachusetts."            Several noted psychiatrists confirmed that this disorder had becomeincreasingly evident among their male patients. "More and more young men intheir late teens and 20s are exhibiting signs of distress," said Dr. WinstonThurston, a professor of neuropsychiatry at Yale University.            "These boys have gone from being bright young things on their way to acollege degree and a promising career to feeling broke, hopeless, and doomed toprofessional failure because they haven't started and walked away from theirown companies yet," Thurston said. "It's as if they've been brainwashed by allthe admiring profiles of Bill Gates and Steve Case into thinking that their ownconsiderable achievements aren't big enough."            Thurston, a member of the editorial board that oversees the publication ofthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, or DSM, said the group was debatingwhether to expand a previous category of addiction in order to cover the newcondition. "Let's face it," he said. "What we're talking about is men gettinghooked on the pornography of success."            Contacted by APE, Susan Faludi, author of Stiffed: The Betrayal of theAmerican Man , agreed with Thurston's definition of business media and saidit amounts to a plot against men.
