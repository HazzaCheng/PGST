                                 Pat's Last Stand                        Issue 1 is the presidential debates--both Democratic and Republican. Issue 2is Pat Buchanan's jump to the Reform Party.            Many pundits think Bradley won the Democratic debate in New Hampshire. Gore,once too stiff, is now trying too hard to loosen up. Gore is the "Eddie Haskellenergizer bunny" while Bradley has the "insouciance of Dean Martin and theiciness of John Malkovich," says Margaret Carlson (CNN's Capital Gang ). Kate O'Beirne ( Capital Gang ) thinksBradley's ideological similarity to Gore helps him, because the voters willfocus on personal style rather than policy. Fox News Sunday 's Juan Williams and Brit Hume think Gore'sattempts to distance himself from President Clinton's "behavior" arehypocritical, given his loyalty as vice president--especially during theimpeachment. Wayne Slater, of NBC's Meet thePress , reveals that the Bush camp is privately more worried aboutfacing Bradley than Gore in a general election. But on ABC's This Week , Gore appears relaxed and amiable. And on Meetthe Press , Bradley supporter Bob Kerry admits that he doesn't know ifBradley's health-care numbers add up and says that neither candidate has beenintellectually honest about Social Security and Medicare reform.            Some pundits--such as Tony Blankley and Lawrence O'Donnell (PBS'sMcLaughlinGroup )--think Bush was smart to stay out of the GOP debate. Butmany--some of them conservative, like Bill Kristol ( This Week ) and BobNovak ( Capital Gang )--think Bush hurt himself by not engaging hisrivals and may lose the New Hampshire primary. Bush's absence helped McCainespecially, say Al Hunt ( Capital Gang ) and Eleanor Clift( McLaughlin ), since he is the only other GOP candidate whom voters canimagine being president. Meanwhile, on Meet the Press , Wayne Slatersays the Bush camp has ruled out McCain and Dole as running mates.            Most pundits think Buchanan has a good shot at the Reform Party nomination,but not the presidency. Some--such as Fox 's Brit Hume,McLaughlin 's Michael Barone and McLaughlin 's LawrenceO'Donnell--think he has been too damaged by his recently published views onWorld War II and Israeli political influence to make much of an impact. (Baronenotes that, even absent these views, Buchanan's core message goes counter tothe country's entire post-WW-II consensus on trade and foreign policy;California would have to fall into the Pacific Ocean for Pat to becomepresident, he says.) Appearing on Meet the Press , Buchanan says hewill not backtrack from his pro-life views and says that this will be his lastcampaign, if he loses. Buchanan was scheduled to appear on CNN's LateEdition , but the entire show is given over to news coverage ofyesterday's plane crash.                           The "Kmart" Myth                        The Fox panel has fun with Time 's report that the Gore campaign had been paying feministcelebrity Naomi Wolf $15,000 a month (laundered through a faceless consultantagency) to advise the candidate on his wardrobe and on his Oedipal relationshipwith Clinton, among other things. "When you get somebody who has been someexotic consultant for the feminist psychobabble movement, who's trying to teach[Gore] about 'alpha male' and 'beta male' stuff, you have to wonder if Al Gorehas any idea who he is," proclaims Brit Hume. Asked about Wolf on ThisWeek , Gore appears nervous but replies that Wolf's pay has been cut andthat she has been working with his daughter Karenna on youth outreach.                           Dept. of Self-Caricature                        "[McCain] sounded just like a Democrat to me. He started talking abouthomeless people and poor people and all that. I don't need a Republican to tellme about that."                  --Bob Novak, on Capital Gang                                       Last Word                        "I will say this into the camera: Jewish-Americans are in my campaign. Theyare welcome to this cause. They are in the Reform Party. ... I am open toappointment of Jewish-Americans to a Cabinet, to a vice presidential seat. Theyare a tremendously able group of Americans. ... Tim, let me just say this: Inthis heart, there is no malice or hatred of any individual. But you are lookingat someone who does enjoy fighting. And if that means fighting occasionallywith the Israeli lobby, as liberals like to fight occasionally with theChristian Coalition, that does not make you an evil person."                  --Pat Buchanan, on Meet the Press
