                                 Rowling As Novelist                        Dear Tony,            Why these books, why now? Boy, that's a hard one. Could be a simple matterof demographics: Boomers' kids are old enough to know what they like and sayso, and there are enough of them to give their collective voice a certainvolume. Or maybe it's a cyclical thing: Fantasy was last in fashion during the'70s, when (as you point out) Star Wars had its astonishing apotheosis.Is it coming back like platform shoes? Or maybe the explanation is Rowling'squick, enchanted pen--she's turned out three Potter stories in two years,leaving her readers no time to lose their appetites. Or could it be ourambivalence about the recent furious surge of moody technology, giving usapparently magical powers that we can't quite control? Or is someone atScholastic a secret marketing genius? Or is Rowling herself a wizard? What'syour pet theory?            I wonder whether it's true, as you claim, that children are less likely thanadults to put up with being preached at. The authors of children's books on thewhole certainly don't seem to think so. Classics like Little Women andThe Secret Garden preach shamelessly without losing their passionateyoung groupies, even today. Kids, after all, get plenty of lectures("discipline," "limits") from their beloved parents. The more recent crop ofbooks continue to preach, though they promote psychological health rather thanmoral rectitude. American writers are far worse in this respect than theBrits--even Konigsberg and Fitzhugh, whom I love as you do, can occasionallysound like guidance counselors. Maybe one of the reasons Rowling hit it bigwith grown-ups is her refusal to drum in lessons. Instead, her books get theirdepth from a combination of allegory and genuine human interactions thathaven't been pre-chewed. She lets her characters learn from their mistakes (orfail to do so). Adults like that--they're can dish out the preaching, but theycan't take it.            One of the pleasures of reading Rowling as a grown-up, which you touch on,is seeing her develop as a novelist. The first book had a simplish dramatictrajectory: Harry is sure he knows who are the good guys and who are the badguys, but he guesses wrong. In the second book, I thought at first that she waspulling the same trick, but I should have trusted her. The apparent villainreally is a villain, of sorts--but she adds surprises. As we learn more andmore clearly in each volume, there are lots of ways to help the forces ofdarkness: You can join them with all your heart, but you can also succumb toprejudice, or self-righteousness, or some apparently silly temptation. AsHagrid, the gruff-but-loveable caretaker, makes clear, you can love the wrongkind of folks (in his case, dragons and monstrous spiders). Or you can just bea vain goofball. In each book, the enemy's helpers become increasinglyrefined.            The series also has some of the excitement that Dickens' readers must havefelt as they read his novels in serial form, knowing he was home workingfrantically on the next installment. Publishing the first books before she'swritten the later ones, Rowling hunts out bits and pieces from earlier on andputs them to new uses. The Whomping Willow, for example, which seems like a bitof inspired slapstick in Volume 1, has an important gesture to make in Volume3, furthering the plot. One tiny character introduced in the first book swellsto chilling proportions at the end of the third. It's like watching Rowlingrummage around for mice and rats to enchant into horses and coachmen.Amazingly, none of it seems artificial.            I wonder how she's going to handle the Great Battle that comes with thegenre, where Good meets Bad for something like a final showdown. So far, she'sgiven us small (if important) skirmishes, and sketched out a grand battle past.The danger of series like this is that they can so easily collapse at the end,becoming too allegorically complex or too morally simple. How do you thinkshe'll handle it?            And do you think Percy, Ron Weasley's perfect prefect/head boy/big brother,will play a villainous role in one of the next books? I hope so.
