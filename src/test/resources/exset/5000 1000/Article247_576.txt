                                 Tangled Web                           USAToday leads with promising new cancer drugs soon to be tested onhumans--a story that got prominent play in Sunday's New York Times .The Washington Post leads with Democrats' harshcriticism of Rep. Dan Burton for his release of the Web Hubbell prison tapes.The New York Timesleads with Washington state's anti-affirmative action ballot initiative. Andthe LosAngeles Times goes with Israel's rejection of an American proposal fora transfer of more West Bank land to the Palestinians.            The two new cancer drugs work, explains USAT , by cutting off theblood supply to tumors, making it impossible for them to grow. Used together,they have eradicated tumors in mice. Which is why they are scheduled for humantrials. But, says the paper, the leap from mouse to man is a huge one.            The WP lead details how Rep. Burton was accused onSunday by congressional Democrats and White House staffers of doctoringtranscripts of Hubbell's prison phone conversations. The material Burtonreleased appears to describe Hubbell's decision to continue to protect Bill andHillary Clinton out of fears that his wife would lose her government job, but,notes the Post , does not include Hubbell's statement that HillaryClinton had "no idea" of billing irregularities at their law firm, or hisassertion that he was not being paid hush money.            Another dispute centers on Hubbell's lawyer saying on the tape, "There issome chance that the day after Election Day they will make a move that mootseverything. And I don't want to discourage it." According to the Post ,Burton says this was a reference to a presidential pardon, but Hubbell's lawyersays it was an immunity deal--eventually granted--with Ken Starr. TheNYT hits the pardon issue much higher in its front page Hubbell tapestory, not surprising since it went front page on Saturday with a story sayingcongressional investigators took the "Election Day" comment to signify pardonhopes.            The Times lead points out that referenda rather thanlegislation may increasingly become the main tool of the anti-affirmativeaction movement, because while California's Prop. 209 won decisively, the billsintroduced in its wake in 13 states were all defeated. The story also scoreshow Washington state business heavyweights line up on the ballot initiative:Boeing and Nordstrom are against, and Microsoft is expected to stayneutral.            The LAT front story on Japan's current economic woes runs under: "TaxCut May Not Spur Yen to Spend in Japan." Do we really need to see this "clever"use of "yen" in a headline ever, ever again?            The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft is warning WallStreet analysts that federal and state legal anti-trust suits against thecompany's introduction of Windows 98 could have "broad, negative consequences"for the entire personal computer industry if they cause that new software to bedelayed.            The Journal 's "The Outlook" piece takes note of recent claims thatthe Y2K problem will generate a recession of 1974 oil-shock caliber and saysthat's not likely: After all, the twenty-two-day-long government shut-down in1996 didn't do that, nor did last summer's UPS strike.            A WP editorial calling on Congress to close moremilitary bases supports the cause with some simple observations: While thenumber of Navy ships is down nearly 46 percent, its berthing space is down only18 percent, and while Army troop strength is down 42 percent, trainingfacilities for soldiers are down only 7 percent. Since, Congress will probablykeep total military spending flat, the paper notes that not closing bases isequivalent to passing cuts on readiness, weapons procurement and research.            According to the WSJ , representatives of some computer companies andof Microsoft are expected to stage a pro-MS rally Tuesday.
