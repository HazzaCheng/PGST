                                 There Ought To Be a Law! Not!                        Good morning, Jesse,            The language news today is big: Quebec Superior CourtJudge Danielle Cote has struck down as unconstitutional a section of thelanguage law, la Loi 101 , that requires French tobe predominant on commercial signs. The judge ruled that two antique dealersdidn't violate the law by hanging a sign outside their store with French on oneside and English on the other, with lettering that is the same size.La loi 101 , passed in 1977, provided that signscould be only in French. That provision was ruled unconstitutional in 1988 andwas replaced with a requirement that French have "greater visibility" or"marked predominance" on signs.            The Quebec government argued in this case that Frenchstill needs protection in the province, while the judge sided with the defense,holding that French had made great strides and is not threatened. JusticeMinister Linda Goupil plans to appeal, while Provincial Liberal leader JeanCharest claimed Quebec's linguistic peace will be threatened by the new ruling.The defense lawyer said he would fight any appeals all the way to the UnitedNations.            The application of the Quebec language law to businesssigns has often been controversial. Government inspectors went around with tapemeasures to make sure French lettering was larger than English. And the Quebecgovernment complained that Anglophone business owners sought to evade the lawby having larger French letters on their signs, but in the faintest of colorsso they couldn't be seen.            I happened to be in Montreal during the20 th anniversary of the passing of Law 101. Ayoung CBC editor assured me that language was a political issue only for theolder generation in the city, that the young people, Anglophone and Francophonealike, were all pretty much bilingual and were generally bemused by all thesquabbling. In the countryside, of course, everyone spoke French, and there wasno language issue there. But older Anglophones assured me they felt constantlinguistic pressure, and that many middle-class English speakers had fled theprovince because their children had been required to attend French schools, andas Anglophones they'd have no economic opportunities in the province aftergraduation.            When the issue of a Puerto Rican statehood referendumwas debated in Congress a couple of years ago, someone wrote to theWashington Post warning that statehood for PuertoRico would mean creating "our very own Quebec" unless the Commonwealth adoptedan official English policy. Quebec is often held up as a warning by supportersof official English. But in fact the Quebecois want to protect French just assupporters of official English want to protect English. The problem is thatlanguage legislation frequently creates more problems than it solves. AndEnglish in the United States doesn't need protection.            Even though French maintains its dominance in Quebec,radical Francophones feel threatened. Even though immigrants to the UnitedStates are abandoning their first languages for English faster than everbefore, to the point where 97 percent of the American population reportsspeaking English well or very well on the 1990 Census, supporters of officialEnglish maintain the language is threatened.            What about the linguistic violence of multilingualcommunities? you may ask. Where violence does occur, it's because languagerights have been taken away, not because minority languages have beentolerated. Official English in the United States is unnecessary.Non-English-speakers already know how important English is for survival.Furthermore, establishing an official language in this country will drive awedge between English-speakers and non-Anglophone immigrants, making it harder,rather than easier, for them to assimilate.            Official-English supporters maintain that language isthe glue that holds us together. I think there'd better be a whole lot morethan language holding this country together. A common language can be aunifying force, but it doesn't have to be one: Look at the Irish, at the Serbsand Croatians, at the speakers of Hindi and Urdu, at all the peoples of theworld separated by a common language.            If Puerto Rico does consider statehood, language willcertainly be an issue. But if you want to create "our very own Quebec," goahead and pass an official English law. That should really stir things up.            Best,Dennis
