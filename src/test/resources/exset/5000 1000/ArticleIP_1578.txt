                                 Let Dole Be Reagan                           The Plan , createdby the all-star Republican media team assembled for the general election, is adisciplined exposition of the dominant Dole/Kemp message that emerged after thecandidate took his foot out of his mouth and started running again. Thestrategy is clear and politically smart: "Let Dole Be Reagan," complete with apartner who is the original supply-sider, co-author of Reagan's 1981 Kemp/Rothtax cut.            This spot kidnaps the wageissue, which historically has belonged to the party of labor, not the party ofbig business. The first two scenes reach for the Reagan Democrats, depictingthe blue- and new-collar middle class that loved Reagan but deposed Bush in1992. Dole's voice-over describes the wage gap they face in simple words:They're "working harder and longer but taking home less."            Indeed, middle-classincome, which rose 1.7 percent a year under Reagan, has stagnated during theClinton recovery. The president has entertained proposals offered by Kennedy,Gephardt, and Reich to boost wages--such as new incentives for corporations toshare soaring profits with workers. But instead of drawing attention toeconomic problems, the prevailing Clinton rule is to emphasize the goodnews.            The Old Dole would haveproduced a spot that analyzed the economy in statistical and legislative terms;the New Dole of The Plan speaks directly into the camera in human terms,in Reaganesque language, about a family spending more on taxes than on "food,clothing, and housing combined." Visually, the spot returns to the office-likescene of Dole's disastrous State                of                the                Unionresponse, but this time the lighting is right, and Dole finally lookspresidential. (Last January, he was done in more by shadows than bysubstance.)            The presidential Dole isshown talking with the workers he claims to identify with, and the voice-overswitches to a narrator, who describes "the Dole Economic Plan." The next scenehas no distracting images, just words, numbers, and this focus: a "15 PercentTax Cut for Every Taxpayer." The absence of any reinforcing visual actuallymakes the simple message all the more vivid.            The visual segues to anuclear family, unifying two different Republican messages--the moral and thematerial: The scene all but shouts that tax cuts are a family value. The spotthen computes what a 15 percent cut will mean to the average family. As we'veseen in other ads, the specificity of the number--$1,657 instead of $1,600--isdesigned to secure credibility. Who would bother to make up the extra $57?            Just before ThePlan closes, we return to Dole chatting with a woman holding an infant, ascene that further humanizes the tax plan and helps close the gender gap. Thenarrator's words about Americans keeping more of what they earn complete themessage. The subtext is that this may be the only real-income increasehard-pressed workers will get.            The final scene reliesonce more on text in big letters to blend the tax issue--"a betterAmerica"--with the character issue--Dole as "a better man." The Plandispels the notion that Dole is Rush Limbaugh, personally attacking thepresident, or Newt Gingrich, savaging Medicare. He's Ronald Reagan--and toprove it, he has the true-believing Jack Kemp as his running mate. The spot,first broadcast four days before Kemp was picked, reveals the logic of thechoice and makes it less of a surprise, even to Dole. Last week, as Dole stoodin Russell, Kan., watching Kemp speak, the TV news made him look like a manreceiving a transfusion. He had a new sense of spirit, a Reagan/Kemp tax cut.He smiled, and his color brightened to a paler Reaganism. Dole may not win, butmaybe now he won't be disgraced.            --Robert Shrum RobertShrum is a leading Democratic political consultant.
