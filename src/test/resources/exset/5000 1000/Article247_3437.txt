                                 Sourpuss McCain; Illiquid Forbes                        ELLEN:            I don't think the killers of Matthew Shepard had the brains to even perceiveof teaching anyone a lesson.            I still disagree with you about TV's coverage of Columbine. Yes, of course,there is the massive hypocrisy of the American public when they say in pollsthat the media is scum: They love all the coverage, love the Lady Di and RoyalFamily hagiography, etc. And of course a large mass murder at a high school,especially with the Nazi and goth and geek overtones, resonates with thepublic, and media, more than day traders in Atlanta, but the coverage wasmind-numbing. It was telling to me that CNN spent four hours of airtime on thefuneral of the black boy who was killed. That smacks of patronization to me.And you have to admit that the coverage of JFK Jr.'s death was over the top:Newsweek and Time milked it for two top-selling issues. WalterIsaacson's personal remarks about Kennedy were embarrassing. Douglas Brinkleyhas ruined his career as a historian by rushing to every TV studio to talkabout his good friend John. His case reminded me of when Eric Burdon suddenlybecame Jimi Hendrix's best friend after he O.D.'d in '70.            Well, we've both been admonished from the                   Slate                chieftains forstraying from the news of the day. My heart says: Fuck them, let's talk aboutwhat we want. However, since they were kind enough to invite us to the table, Ido have a few things to say about today's "news." I know you're not asfascinated by electoral politics as I am, dismissing it all in a Ralph Nadersort of way, but I cannot for the life of me understand the Beltway media'scontinuing love affair with Sen. John McCain. McCain is sleazy: Talk to anyreporter in Arizona (which no Washington pundit does) and you won't hear aboutwhat a "maverick" he is. Instead, they'll draw a picture of a sour,press-hating scumbag who's not very nice to women and has shady businessdealings to boot. People forget he was part of the Keating Five. In today'sWall Street Journal , Gerald Seib writes the same story about McCain thatwe've seen for months: He's unpredictable, angers Republicans with his campaignfinance and tobacco stands (making him an honorary Democrat with that sort oflunacy), but is fiercely pro-life. And of course his POW rsum. I wish boomerpundits would get over the guilt of not serving in Vietnam: They were right. Itwas a stupid war and not worth fighting and dying for. Get over not having that"experience."            The New York Post , and other papers, reports today that Steve Forbesisn't quite as "liquid" as everyone thought and is going to have to sell someassets to compete with Bush. I wonder how his family feels about his quixotic,and ultimately selfish, presidential campaign? If I were one of his fivedaughters, I'd be sort of pissed. But Forbes has caught the presidentialaphrodisiac. Instead of dealing with Bush, and getting a plum position in hisadministration, or running for senator from New Jersey, where he'd stand abetter chance than Christie Whitman, he's enriching the television stations invarious states to get out his message. I like his message, but I read it everyday on the Journal's editorial page.            I'll get to the Voice's redesign next time, which is handsome, butI'll close with a tidbit in today's New York Observer by Carl Swanson,the under-30 media critic who writes like George Will. The Voice hasadded a new biweekly column called "Pucker Up," about anal sex. Swanson writesin his sniffy Observer way: "Nobody ever said the Voice was allabout the high road" and objects to the headline of the column "I Am Butt Girl,Hear My Ass Roar!" He then asks editor Don Forst if that isn't a bit too much.Jesus, what prudes we have in the media! Anal sex in the Voice , orNYPress , is the norm. I'm sure readers won't raise an eyebrow.            Best,RUSS
