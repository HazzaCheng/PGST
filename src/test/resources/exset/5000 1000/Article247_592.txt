                                 Aum My God!            The pledge by Indonesia's new leader, B.J. Habibie, to hold elections withinone year leads at USA Today , the New York Timesand the Washington Post . The Los AngelesTimes puts Indonesia on the front but leads with the dispute betweenCalifornia's Gov. Wilson and the Clinton administration over how much to payformer welfare recipients for the state-supplied community service jobs theyare offered when they cannot find work on their own. The feds say pay minimumwage. The state says that's not necessary, since welfare-to-work is anassistance program not an employment program.            The election pledge is one of several reforms announced yesterday inIndonesia. The NYT lead reports that two prominent political prisonerswere released late Monday night, one a labor leader jailed for inciting a riot,and the other a former legislator jailed for insulting Suharto. (The WPputs this in a separate piece deep inside.) The country's justice minister saidthat the release of other political prisoners will follow soon. Also,USAT reports (and the WP implies), plans are underway for a trialof the fourteen soldiers suspected in the killings of six demonstrators duringthe riots that toppled Suharto. And, says USAT , the government alsoannounced it will review its business dealings with companies owned by formerSuharto. The WP describes this move in stronger terms: the beginning of"severing" the government's close links with those companies. The LATsays that already under the new policy some small public works contracts havebeen canceled. The WP and LAT note that Habibie's pronouncementscame just one day before the International Monetary Fund is due to beginnegotiating terms for release of the latest installment of a stalled $43billion bailout package.            The Post says that the military is strongly supporting reform. TheLAT says that Habibie does not enjoy military support and that thesemoves appear to ensure that he will be an "interim figure."            A NYT front-page story reports that the Japanese cult, Aum Shinrikyo,whose members have been implicated in the twelve-fatality nerve gassing of theTokyo subway in 1995, had previously conducted numerous biological warfare attacks inJapan. Using rooftops and truck convoys, the group conducted, concludes theTimes , at least nine germ attacks on such targets as the JapaneseLegislature, the Imperial Palace, and the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka.Hearteningly, the attacks failed because the terrorists couldn't obtain orproduce germs of sufficient virulence. Dishearteningly, neither Japanese norAmerican authorities--including the U.S. Navy or the CIA--detected any ofthem.            On the WP front, ace political reporter David Broder checks in fromCalifornia to report that Prop. 226, which would require unions to get annualpermission from individual members to make any political use of dues, is,despite a commanding early lead in the polls, now sinking fast. The mainreason, Broder reports, seems to be the huge amount of money--nearly $20million--unions have poured into anti-226 ads. Doesn't this kind of turnaroundpower of union spending pretty much drive home 226's point?            The Wall Street Journal reports that, according to ManpowerInc.'s latest employment-outlook survey, nearly a third of U.S. businessesintend to increase staffing in the third quarter. The paper quotes the glossprovided by Manpower's chairman: "There has never been a job market even closeto this."            OK, OK, so you already know it's just about impossible to get any Viagra.But that's in this country. What about, wonders an LAT front-pager, therest of the world? The paper turns up a $42 bottle of the stuff in a MexicoCity market, but it's counterfeit. In Taiwan, the real thing goes for $60 bucksa pill on the black market. And in Turkey, the under-the-table price is up to$800 a bottle. But, says the LAT , Viagra is legal in SanMarino--however, the place has been overrun by would-be Italian stallions, sogood luck finding any. In a world of lurid myopia, it's refreshing to see thata paper is still willing to put seven staffers on an overseas story.
