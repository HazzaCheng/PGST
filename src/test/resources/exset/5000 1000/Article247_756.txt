                                 Settling News            All papers--the New York Times , the Washington Post , and the Los AngelesTimes --lead with the $850,000 settlement reached Friday betweenPresident Clinton and Paula Jones, which will end Jones' 4-1/2 year sexualharassment case against the President. Under the agreement, Clinton offers noapology to Jones--a condition which "[Jones] had once called her most importantdemand," notes the NYT . Clinton must pay Jones within 60 days; the moneyis expected to come from insurance or Clinton's legal defense fund. Real estatemagnate Abe Hirschfeld's flamboyant offer to pay Jones $1 million is not partof the settlement. The agreement must first be approved by the federal judgewho dismissed the Jones suit in April, but this should be routine.            Purveying the logic of the Clinton side, the President's lawyer RobertBennett commented, "The president has decided he is not prepared to spend onemore hour on this matter." One jubilant White House official quoted in theWP says, "What this means is that not a single one of those 750 days[left in Clinton's term] will be taken up by Paula Jones." All papers concludethat the Jones settlement brings Clinton one step further toward closing theimpeachment proceedings.            In other scandal developments, carried in all papers: Independent counselKenneth Starr sent the House Judiciary Committee two boxes of new documents onKathleen Willey, the former White House volunteer who has alleged that Clintonof groped her. The new information--which was not made public--"did not containa formal accusation of wrongdoing against Clinton," avers the NYT . Thepapers concur that the material is unlikely to delay the Clinton impeachmentinquiry. In a separate development, Hillary Clinton's former law partnerWebster Hubbell was slapped with a 15-count indictment yesterday by Starr, whoaccuses Hubbell of lying to federal regulators. Starr has already brought twoindictments against Hubbell; Hubbell has already served 18 months in federalcustody. Hubbell's frustrated lawyer, John Nields, commented, "It is not normalfor a prosecutor to keep indicting the same person over and over again."            The WP and NYT front stories on a landmark $206 billionsettlement proposal reached between eight states and tobacco companies--a topicthat the LAT ran as a lead last Wednesday. The states had sued torecover costs of smoking-related medical care. Under the agreement--the detailsof which should be finalized by Monday--tobacco companies would face variousmarketing restrictions, including a ban on billboard advertising. Before thesettlement is implemented, it must be ratified by most of the other 38 stateswith pending or contemplated suits against tobacco companies.            With few major new developments in the U.S.-Iraq standoff, all papers runfront-page stories on violence in Indonesia. Troops and riot police in Jakartafired on Friday demonstrations by thousands of anti-government protesters,mostly students. At least five people are dead. The WP writes that it was the"bloodiest day of street battles since the fall of then-president Suharto lastMay."            An excellent piece in the NYT "Arts" section chronicles the growing dissent to "Washington Consensus," a post-Cold Warmethodology that favors open markets and freer trade. Alarmed by the globalfinancial crisis, some leaders, notably Europeans, are pushing for strongerglobal economic regulation. Specific proposals have ranged from establishing anew U.N. Security Council for economic affairs to setting exchange ratetargets. However, Washington, buoyed by the "spirit of American capitalism,"tends to be averse to increased global regulation.            Those British royals are feuding again. This time, says a WP "Style"article, it's Charles in the doghouse. Apparently Charles' media gurushave spun the prince as steady and reliable, in contrast to Diana's wildness.This is sacrilege against Lady Di. Media stories also contain unpardonablehints that Charles is tired of the shadow of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II,and actually wants to be king someday. As implicit punishment, Queen ElizabethII will skip her dear son's 50th birthday fete Saturday night for, um, anunfortunate scheduling conflict.
