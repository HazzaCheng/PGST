                                 From On Hyde            The papers are dominated by the political reactions of the White House andits critics to Saturday's House Judiciary vote forwarding articles ofimpeachment to the full House. Most of the leads report that Republicancongressional leaders (the Washington Post specifies Tom Delay, Dick Armey and HenryHyde; the Los Angeles Times , New York Timesand USAToday cite Hyde) have called for Clinton to resign and then haveClinton's remarks in Israel rejecting the suggestion, saying the possibilityhas never even crossed his mind. And all but USAT have Clinton's reneweddenial that he committed Lewinsky-related perjury.            All the papers save USAT cite worsening House prospects for the WhiteHouse, with the LAT quoting Rep. Charles Schumer as saying the odds forimpeachment are now "quite strong." One factor that all the papers note:Speaker-designate Bob Livingston's pronouncement Saturday night that he thinksa censure alternative should be kept from House consideration. This wouldremove a non-impeachment option that would have still allowed members tocriticize Clinton. The WP and LAT say that House Democrats areplanning various procedural moves to try to force censure before the Houseanyway. USAT cites fresh polling--with nice high mentions of sample size(865) and margin of error (4 percent)--indicating that popular opposition toimpeachment has slipped 7 percent in the past week.            The NYT has some unusually harsh language from Republicans. Tom DeLay is quotedsaying, "I'm suggesting the President of the United States cannot be believedand I think it's reflective in his foreign policy....Saddam Hussein knows itand that's why he jerks his chain all the time." And the Times has Rep.Billy Tauzin saying, "You see he's lied to me personally on a very seriousmatter," referring, says the paper, to the energy tax in the 1993 budget deal.The paper explains after these quotes that "Clinton has never been well likedin Congress."            The NYT front-page pic of Clinton touching Yitzhak Rabin's headstonereveals the president's thousand-yard stare, and the LAT reports thatClinton looked fatigued and that by the end of his day in Israel "his eyes hadnarrowed to slits."            Both the NYT and LAT fronts do "man-in-the-street" storiesabout public sentiment regarding impeachment. The NYT 's is focused onCanton, Ohio and the LAT 's on Abilene, Texas. And of course, both piecesquote a colorful array of characters on both sides of the question. Now, whatdo these pieces really accomplish? At least the NYT has the excuse thatCanton has been an uncanny bellwether of presidential prospects in severalelections. But still, such pieces are utterly random and anecdotal. Polls arebad enough, but these pieces are basically bad polls.            A Wall Street Journal front-page feature describes astunning reason why nuclear proliferation may finally have become unstoppable:the radical availability now of the raw computing power nuclear weaponsprograms require. The story convinces right off the bat, with the dean ofStanford's Engineering school explaining how you could craft a supercomputerwith a couple of thousand bucks and a ten-minute trip to Fry's Electronics. After all, the paperpoints out, the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal was designed on computers runningat or below the speed of most current PCs. According to the Journal ,under newly loosened export regulations, China has procured nearly 300high-speed computers, some of which have "ended up in the wrong hands."            The WP reports that David Boies, Dept. of Justice lead attorney forthe Microsoft case, has since last April been charging the government only $50an hour, compared to his regular fee of $550 an hour. If Boies lowered his feein order to keep his share of work on the case, would that be illegal?            In case you're wondering who exactly Henry Hyde thinks he is, consider whathe says in the NYT in response to the claim that the American people donot support impeachment: "Look, if Jesus Christ had taken a poll, he wouldnever have preached the gospel."
