                                 The &quot;Tax Scheme&quot; Scheme            Sundayon Meet the Press , White House Chief of Staff John Podesta demonstratedhow Democrats plan to win the budget debate. Answer to Question 1: The GOP'snew legislation "uses up the entire surplus for this risky tax scheme." Answerto Question 2: "It would clearly be better to ... pay down $100 billion worthof debt than pass this risky tax scheme." Answer to Question 3: Failure to cuttaxes would be "better than seeing this risky tax scheme signed into law." Theway Podesta puts it, it's not clear whether the "scheme" would cut your taxesor raise them. That's the whole idea.            "Riskytax scheme" was coined in 1996 to refer to Bob Dole's proposed 15 percent taxcut. According to Democratic National Committee and Clinton-Gore campaign ads,Dole's plan was "risky" because it would "balloon the deficit" and forceCongress "to cut Medicare, education, [and the] environment." The rationale forcalling it a tax "scheme"--in contrast to President Clinton's tax "cuts"--wasthat it would "actually raise taxes on 9 million working people" by narrowingthe Earned Income Tax Credit.            Clinton blasted Dole's "risky tax scheme" in every speech, but that wasn'tenough for Al Gore. In the vice presidential debate, Gore used the phrase eighttimes. Pundits marveled at his robotic repetition. Dole's campaign chairmanprotested that "leaving money in someone's pocket is not a scheme" but laterconceded that this "focus-group tested" phrase had killed the Republicanticket.            Nowthe deficit has turned into a surplus, and Dole's 15 percent plan has given wayto other tax-cut proposals. But that hasn't stopped Gore from renewing hisfavorite chant. At a senior citizens' rally last fall, he used the magic phrasethree times. Republicans "are trying to come up with this huge, risky taxscheme and finance it by taking money out of the surplus that has been built upentirely because of the Social Security trust fund," Gore warned. Two monthslater, he assailed George W. Bush's "compassionate conservatism," declaring,"Compassion means reserving the surplus until we save Social Security first ...not going back to the risky tax schemes and economic upheaval of the '80s."            Today,Gore and other Democrats use "risky tax scheme" with abandon, ignoring thedisappearance of the circumstances that originally justified the phrase. In1996, a tax cut was "risky" if it would "balloon the deficit." In 1999, it's"risky" if it would "blow the surplus." In 1996, a "tax scheme" was a plan thatostensibly would raise taxes on some people while cutting taxes for others. In1999, "tax scheme" is just a euphemism--actually, a malphemism--to conceal thatyour opponent is proposing a tax cut and to trick uninformed listeners intothinking that he might raise their taxes instead.            Youcan argue, as even some Republicans do, that the current tax-cut bill is ascheme because it favors the wealthy and various special interests. But it'sstill a tax cut. The only reason to delete the word "cut" when referring to thebill is to withhold this information because you know it would incline youraudience to support the bill. For years, Republicans have called budget outlays"spending," "welfare," and "waste" to conceal that half the money goes back tothe middle class through entitlements. "Risky tax scheme" is the Democrats'most concerted attempt to turn this tactic against the GOP. The message is:When Republicans mess with the tax code, somebody else is getting the money,and you're getting screwed.            Theprice of this spin is that it insults people's intelligence, in part throughdeceptive censorship and in part through mindless repetition. Podesta denouncesthe GOP's "risky tax scheme" at least twice per interview. Two weeks ago, a DNCpress release used the phrase four times in a span of 60 words. Gore seemsincapable of appearing in public without reciting "risky tax scheme" threetimes. Rather than simply acknowledge the tax cut and argue its merits, he'sbetting that we're stupid. In the long run, that's not a smart bet.
