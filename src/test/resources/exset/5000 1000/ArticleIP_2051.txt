                                 Justice            Two hundred years ago, alawyer named William Blackstone said it's better for 10 guilty people to gofree than for one innocent person to suffer. And for two centuries, legalscholars have considered Blackstone's pronouncement a profound statement ofprinciple. Apparently, none of those scholars has thought to ask the obviousfollow-up question, namely, why 10? Why wasn't it 12 or eight? The answer, ofcourse, is that Blackstone invented a number out of thin air. That kind offlippancy amounts to a defiant refusal to think seriously about the trade-offsinvolved in designing a criminal justice system. But for 200 years, legalscholars have cited Blackstone's refusal to think and mistaken it for anexample of a thought.            There'snothing profound about recognizing a trade-off between convicting the innocentand acquitting the guilty. The hard part is deciding how many false acquittalsyou're willing to accept to avoid a false conviction. That number matters. Itmatters whether it is 10 or 12 or eight, because every time we rewrite acriminal statute or modify the rules of evidence, we are adjusting the terms ofthe trade-off. So it's got to be worth it to think about what terms we want toaim for.            Here's one approach: Imagine how a guilty man going free ora free man getting convicted might affect your life. (Or, so we don't get toodeeply sidetracked into your personal idiosyncrasies, how the guilty going freeor the free getting convicted might affect the lives of your neighbors.) On theone hand, your neighbors risk being falsely accused and convicted. On the otherhand, they risk being victimized by criminals who have been falsely acquitted(or by others who were emboldened to become criminals because of the frequencyof false acquittals). In principle, the cost of either disaster can be measuredin dollars. In practice, we can approximate those measures by making areasonable guess as to how much your typical neighbor would be willing to payto avoid a year in jail or to avoid being robbed on the way home from work.            Afterestimating the costs of being either an imprisoned innocent or a crimevictim, we can estimate the probability that your neighbor will actuallyface each of these problems. But once we know the cost and the probabilityassociated with a given risk, we can infer a lot about how undesirable thatrisk is. We can do this, for example, by observing the way people behave ininsurance markets. Suppose you want to know just how unpleasant it is to face a1 percent chance of a $100,000 loss. Then all you have to do is look at thosepeople who face a 1 percent chance of losing their $100,000 homes in a fire andsee how much they are willing to pay for fire insurance.            If you don't like insurance markets, you canlook at labor markets: How much extra must you pay a worker to get him to takea 1 percent risk of, say, losing an arm? If we believe for independent reasonsthat the value of an arm is $100,000 (no, I don't mean to say that isthe value of an arm; this is a hypothetical example), then we have another wayto put a dollar value on the unpleasantness of a 1 percent risk of a $100,000loss.            Or youcan use data from financial markets: How much more interest must you offer aninvestor to get him to accept a 1 percent risk of a $100,000 financial loss?That's relatively easy to observe, and it gives yet another measure of how muchpeople dislike this particular level of risk.            False acquittals and false convictions are each associatedwith certain levels and probabilities of risk. By examining behavior ininsurance markets, labor markets, and financial markets, we can make somereasonable guesses about how much people dislike each of these prospects, andalso the extent to which people are willing to trade off one kind of risk forthe other. That will give an indication of whether we ought to be expanding orrestricting the rights of defendants.            It would take quite a bit ofwork to complete that project, and at the end all you'd have is a roughestimate. Your final number would be suspect in a hundred ways. For example,the data from insurance and labor markets tell a pretty consistent story aboutpeople's aversion to risk, but the data from financial markets make the degreeof risk aversion appear much higher. There might be no entirely satisfactoryway to resolve such inconsistencies. But until you've done some kind ofanalysis, quoting a number such as "10" is both dishonest and disreputable.
