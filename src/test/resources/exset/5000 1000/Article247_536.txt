                                 Whitewatershed?                           USAToday leads with the death of James McDougal. The Washington Post goes with the upcoming return grand juryappearance of Betty Currie. The Los AngelesTimes leads with Madeleine Albright seeking a tough stance on Serbianviolence in Yugoslavia. And the New York Timesgoes with drawing the basic Capitol Hill battle lines regarding the upcomingsurplus budget. The Times says a rift has opened between HouseRepublicans, who continue to aggressively opt for tax cuts, and SenateRepublicans, who are more apt to go along with the basic thrust of the Clintonbudget plan.            The death of McDougal on Sunday, of a heart attack in the prison where hewas serving his Whitewater sentence, is widely viewed as trouble for Ken Starr.USAT says it means the end for Starr of a steady stream of informationon the Clintons' business and political activities. The LAT front-pageMcDougal piece says his death could be a "setback." USAT calls McDougala "dashing eccentric." The WP calls him a "wily Arkansas bankingrogue."            Everybody quotes President Clinton's statement of condolence: "I have goodmemories of the years we worked together in Arkansas, and I extend mycondolences to his family." The USAT and the WP (in its "Style"section profile) mention that the White House statement notably lacked anyexpression of sympathy from Hillary Clinton. The Post says there is aMcDougal book on the way titled "Arkansas Mischief."            Last Friday's NYT lead set out the meaning of the WP 's Clintondeposition scoop from the day before: that the president's secretary, BettyCurrie, had become the central character in his accounts of all his dealingswith Monica Lewinsky. It apparently took several days for that to sink in atthe Post , where today's lead makes essentially the same point. The paper'squotes this gender- and religion-confused defense of Currie offered by JesseJackson: "Betty Currie isn't a lone gunman shooting from the hips....She is agovernment servant and a Christian woman....It isn't like Betty to be makingindependent decisions of her own volition."            The LAT lead states that on the eve of a six nation conference inLondon, Albright is pushing European allies to act decisively to end the recentoutbreak of violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The paper notes thatFrance may balk at punitive measures directed against Serbia. The NYT 'sveteran war correspondent Chris Hedges provides detailed reporting on the ground from Prekaz in Kosovo province.Hedges says there were clear indications the town saw heavy combat, indicatingthat the Albanian side was not unarmed. Hedges' dispatch includes the harrowingtale of an Albanian woman who fled Prekaz with her five children after herhusband was killed.                           USAT has a brief front-page blurb and the WP has a moredetailed piece based on the report in this week's Time that the FBI andState Department are investigating the theft, during the height of the Iraqcrisis, by a man in a brown tweed jacket, of top secret documents from a secureState Dept. office just down the hall from Albright's. So far, the papersreport that authorities suspect an inside job.            The Wall Street Journal 's main "Politics and Policy" piecestates that based on recent White House performances, "the Clinton legal teamclearly is calling the shots in the Lewinsky flap, and its strategy is simple:the less said, the better." In the piece, Dee Dee Myers joins fellow Clintonalum George S. in dumping on the White House: "Throughout the Clintonpresidency, even times when I was there, the White House has created theappearance of wrongdoing by being slow to come forward with the facts."            Journalists have been uniformly weak-willed in their inability to resist theMonica Lewinsky saga. WilliamSafire demonstrates an inability to resist Monica Lewinsky. Today, hiscolumn is quite firm. Seems ol' Bill had a chance hook-up with her in D.C.'sposh Cosmos Club: "The dark-eyed young woman looked attractive in a simpleshort black dress and black stockings....She was too carefully coiffured, buthad a sort of natural, youthful, exuberant smile that anybody, even aPresident, would enjoy seeing around the office."
