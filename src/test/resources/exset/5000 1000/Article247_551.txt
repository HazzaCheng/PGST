                                 The Senate Butts In                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with the new tobacco settlement billtaking shape in the Senate. The New York Timesleads with the endorsement by House Republican leaders of new tax breaks tohelp people who must buy their own health insurance. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the general split inside Republican ranks over whetheror not tax cuts should be part of this year's budget. The story notes that thecurrent proposed House budget includes tax cuts totaling $60 billion, comparedto the $350 billion worth of cuts called for in the Contract with America.                           USAT reports that the proposed tobacco bill would raise the price ofa pack of cigarettes by $1.10 and would cost cigarette companies more than halfa trillion dollars--a considerable increase over the $365 billion agreed to inthe proposed settlement reached last summer between the attorneys general of 40states and the leading tobacco manufacturers. Like that settlement, the Senatebill aims to reduce underage smoking, regulate nicotine as a drug and alter thetone and reach of tobacco advertising. It also includes a payout to tobaccofarmers as compensation for lost income.            The WP states, "Both the tobacco industry and public health advocatesassailed the bill from opposite directions: The industry called its price-tag'unrealistic and onerous' while public health advocates said it was too weak onthe key issue of cutting underage smoking." Yet, USAT says, "tobaccoindustry spokesmen declined public comment." Also, it's very odd to talk aboutthe reaction of the "industry" and "public health advocates" so broadly.Neither are monoliths. So, why no for-attribution quotes in the Postaccount here?            The Post does explain one nuance USAT overlooks: whether that$1.10 per pack surcharge specified in the bill will actually raise cigaretteprices enough to significantly reduce cigarette purchases. By the way, theNYT states the Republicans plan to pay for their health insuranceinitiative with revenue raised from higher cigarette taxes, with or without thepassage of a comprehensive tobacco settlement.            The Wall Street Journal presents the "Award for EnvironmentalLunacy" to the Michigan bureaucrat who sent a letter to a landowner lastDecember threatening him with "enforcement action" for "unauthorized" and"hazardous" dam-building on his property. The landowner responded by pointingout that the dams were built by...beavers.            The Journal 's main "Politics and Policy" piece notes asignal consequence of the absorption of the White House staff in the Clintonsex scandals: the further empowerment of his Cabinet officers. Especially true,says the paper, for Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, LawrenceSummers, Budget Director Frank Raines, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,and Defense Secretary William Cohen.            The WP runs a front-page piece noting that the NCAA is very worried about the fallout from the point-shavingindictment last week of two former Northwestern basketball players. Theamount of money bet legally in Nevada on this year's basketball tournament,says the Post , exceeds the amount bet there on the Super Bowl, and theFBI says close to $2.5 billion is bet on it illegally. Gee, maybe, thesituation would improve if newspapers didn't print point-spreads.            Meanwhile, the NYT front is concerned with another, er, sport. TheTimes takes note of the latest developments in professional wrestling:more sexual content, coarser language, and no more Good Guys. This apparentlyproduced an existential crisis on 43rd St.: "Now, there is no obvious moralcenter: everything is basically bad and worse." Thank God, there's BrendanMaguire, a professor of sociology at Western Illinois University specializingin wrestling, for these troubled Times to quote.            Over the weekend, "Titanic" director James "King of the World" Cameron beganexercising the perks of his new office by writing a piece in the LAT inwhich he tried to fire the paper's lead film critic, author of two scathingreviews of the iceberg epic. "Forget about Clinton," the director wrote, "Howdo we impeach Kenneth Turan?"
