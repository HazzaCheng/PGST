                                 The Sweet Problem of Success                         The pundits made the budgetsurplus Issue 1. Liberals said Washington should spend it and conservativessaid it should be given back to the taxpayers. E.J. Dionne's proposal on NBC'sMeet the Press that the surplus could engender a "substantive" politicaldebate about "what we want government to do" was truncheoned by fellow panelistRobert Novak. Surpluses always lead to talk of "tax cuts or higher spending,"said Novak, with spending inevitably winning. David Broder ( Meet thePress ) criticized the "element of fantasy" in the spend-it-or-give-it-backdiscussion given the unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities loomingearly in the next century. On Fox News Sunday , Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del.,seconded Broder: The surplus allows us to "set the system straight 30 yearsout" with "no political costs" to Democrats or Republicans who resist the callsfor increased spending and tax cuts.            "Isn't itnice," said a radiant Bob Schieffer (CBS's Face the Nation ), that theweekend's biggest problem was how to handle the extraordinary good news of abudget surplus? Not nice at all, said the Five Big Thinkers on PBS'sNewsHour With Jim Lehrer (Michael Beschloss, Doris Kearns Goodwin,Haynes Johnson, Roger Rosenblatt, and Richard Rodriguez). The Big Thinkersfound only the dark lining in our silver cloud. Future generations will judgeus, said Beschloss, on how we used "this tranquil moment" to address ourproblems. Goodwin said that as long as the public's hunger for a nationalpurpose and community goes unfed by Washington, they will turn to tabloidtales--Diana's death, the nanny case, the murder of Gianni Versace--for meaningand civic involvement.            Embracing this theme, Dionne instructed President Clintonto "stop all this public pondering" over his "legacy" and actually harness ourcurrent good fortune to some glowing idea. But the liberal commentariansthemselves had little to offer in the way of imaginative suggestions, fallingback on the usual ideas about expanding the federal role in education,rebuilding the infrastructure, and providing health care to the uninsured.Meanwhile, the Sunday New York Times reported that the states--with aneye on the November elections--are already celebrating the New Golden Age withtax cuts.            A snarl ofother news issues vied for the No. 2 slot, but all failed to reach criticalmass because 1) the pundits failed to advance the debate (the InternationalMonetary Fund bailout of South Korea), 2) the pundits had nothing weighty tosay (Chief Justice William Rehnquist's rebuke of the Senate for failing to fillfederal judgeships; Clinton's plan to extend Medicare to 62-year-olds), or 3)because a political talk show is an awkward venue for the discussion (the"Unabomber" prosecution of Ted Kaczynski; the death of Michael Kennedy). Withthe issue-generating machine of Congress out of session, the commentariatproved that it's as bad at the vision thing as it accuses Clinton of being.                           Punditus Interruptus, Week 3: RobertNovak was a gentleman this week on Capital Gang , letting Al Hunt finishall his sentences without interruption. Hunt cut Novak off once, evening therunning score at 2-2.                           David Brinkley Returns toThis Week : As pitchman for Archer Daniels Midland, thegovernment-subsidy swilling, political-talk-show sponsoring agribiz giant.            "Pundit Central" issufficiently cynical about TV pundits that the transformation of one of theminto a corporate shill should set off no alarms. But it does, perhaps becausefour decades of sanctimonious droning by Brinkley as a network news anchor andthen as the founding pundit of This Week created the illusion that hewas a principled journalist who couldn't be bought by a price-fixingcorporation. As Brinkley's first ADM commercial unspooled on ABC's ThisWeek , he spoke obliquely about having accepted a new position, deliberatelyfostering the notion that he was returning to ABC as some sort of superpundit.Then he explained that in coming weeks he'd be talking about nutrition andagriculture in the service of ADM. Brinkley's appearance as a pitchman in themiddle of his old program was so disconcerting that when This Weekresumed, co-host Cokie Roberts attempted to salvage the show's good name byreiterating Brinkley's disclaimer. The move backfired, unintentionallyreminding viewers that the big difference between ADM and ABC is that ADM isjust a couple of letters farther down the alphabet.                           --JackShafer
