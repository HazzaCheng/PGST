                                                            TheSpeaker Speaks                        Eightyears ago House speaker presumptive Bob Livingston, then an obscure juniorcongressman, and                   Slate               's Jacob Weisberg, then an obscure writerfor the New Republic , were both on an official U.S. delegation tocertify the legitimacy of an election in Guatemala. It was Bush administrationpolicy that democracy was spreading in Latin America and that the election wasgoing to be fair. Weisberg wrote in TNR about his adventures:            When we arrived back atthe Supreme Electoral Headquarters at the Hotel El Dorado two hours before thepolls closed, our delegation was already working on its statement. BobLivingston, a bluff Republican representative from Louisiana, had somehowbecome our chairman and was summing up the prevailing consensus that theelection was free and fair. I pointed out that at least two of us had heardcharges of vote buying. "Vote buying isn't fraud," Livingston bellowed. "Icould show you vote buying all over Louisiana."            The logichere is that of Tallulah Bankhead's famous remark about cocaine: "Of courseit's not addictive, darling. I use it all the time." But Livingston's exquisiteethical sensitivity should serve the new speaker well as he presides overcongressional investigations of presidential perjury, campaign finance abuse,and so on.                           Where inthe World Is Michael Lewis?                        Many readers find itsuspicious that Michael Lewis has stopped filing dispatches from the Microsoftantitrust trial, and they do not accept our explanation that he got bored,found the hard wooden seats nightmarishly uncomfortable (especially combinedwith the judge's power-mad restrictions on leaving to go to the bathroom), felthe had said most of what he wanted to say, has a pressing book deadline, and soon. They think he was canned because his reports were critical ofMicrosoft.            It's nottrue. It simply isn't true. There is no evidence for it because it's not ...not--well, it's all nonsense, is what it is. In short, it's not true. And ifwe're stammering a bit, that may reflect the strain of not making any jokes.Because we wrote a jokey little item in this space two weeks ago about havingLewis killed and whatnot, and some people have taken it seriously. We hope that                  Slate                hasn't attracted the kind of readership that needs the word"PARODY" or "SATIRE" or "HUMOR" stamped on every bit of good-hearted raillery(and we hope that what we publish in these genres is funny enough not torequire labeling).            Lewis is alive and well and willing to testifythat                   Slate                expressed nothing but disappointment at his entirelyvoluntary decision that he'd had enough. One part of the problem here may be amisunderstanding of how journalism, especially magazine journalism, works. Howmysterious is it, really, that a writer should drop out of a project before itis completed? Answer: Not very. Does such an occurrence justify paranoidspeculation about corrupt motives and conflicts of interest? Answer: No, not atall. Many people might suppose that it is highly unusual for a writer to agreeto produce some piece of writing and then fail to produce it, perhaps offeringa variety of whiny and often hypochondriac excuses about hard wooden benchesand so on. That is because many people do not know writers. In fact, suchbehavior is extremely common. In fulfilling perhaps half of a medium-term oralagreement to cover a trial of uncertain duration and with long periods ofboredom and discomfort, Michael Lewis is actually above average! So we thankhim for his dispatches and invite readers to check out hisreplacements: Herbert Stein, Jodie T. Allen, and others still to come.
