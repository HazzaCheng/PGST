                                 To Hang or Not To Hang            Thesentencing to death for murder and treason of the Kurdish separatist leaderAbdullah Ocalan was the top story Wednesday across Europe, with practically allnewspapers urging the Turkish government to call off his execution. An array ofeditorials in France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Spain trotted out much thesame arguments: Hanging Ocalan would ignite more Kurdish violence in Turkey andfurther strain Turkey's relations with the countries of the European Union,which it wants to join. It was also widely claimed that the arrest andconviction of Ocalan offers a rare opportunity for Turkey to negotiate a peacesettlement with its rebellious Kurdish minority.            InBritain, the Times proposed a do-nothing policy "until today's passion andpolemics fade away." It said: "Formally commuting the death sentence might, fornow, strike Turkish voters as weak. But if Ocalan was alive, in prison, with adeath sentence over his head, the PKK [his Kurdish Workers' Party] mightexercise more restraint: meanwhile, the Turkish Government might win time for abroader approach to the Kurdish question." The liberal Guardian said it would be"greatly in Turkey's interest" to embark on a dialogue with the Kurds. It said:"The Kurdish question, the existence of which Ankara officially denies,continues in reality to disrupt its internal affairs. ... It has hamperedTurkey's ambition to join the EU, and raised concerns about its NATOmembership. The constant stream of condemnation of Turkey's oppression of itsKurdish minority poisons daily its commerce with the world." The Independent said thatalthough Ocalan was no saint or democratic hero, hanging him would only makethings worse by turning him into a martyr for the Kurdish cause.            InGermany, Die Welt ledon European indignation at the death sentence and appeals for Turkey to commuteit. In a front-page commentary, the paper said it was true that Ocalan hasblood on his hands and that the Turkish people want revenge, but it also saidthat "a dead leader would be immortal as a martyr to the Kurdish cause." InParis, Le Figaroreported that Europe was "mobilizing" to save Ocalan and commented on its frontpage that Turkey has every reason to show generosity toward the Kurds: "It isin a position of strength on the ground, and it knows that a gesture ofappeasement would convince the European Union to look more favorably on itsapplication to join, which has been on the table since 1987."            InItaly, the papers also led on European warnings to Turkey not to carry out thedeath sentence, and LaRepubblica of Rome said that just as the price for Russia's cooperationin Kosovo had been a huge loan, so perhaps the price of Ocalan's life would beTurkey's entry into Europe. In Spain, El Pas said that Ankara would be committing "a graveerror" if it carries out the death penalty against Ocalan, since it has "anhistoric opportunity to exercise magnanimity and to lay the foundations of areconciliation with the Kurds."            Theother main stories in the European press Wednesday were the first bigdemonstration in Yugoslavia against President Slobodan Milosevic, and thecliff-hanging negotiations in Belfast on the implementation of the NorthernIreland peace settlement, for which British Prime Minister Tony Blair hasdeclared midnight Wednesday the "absolute" deadline. But British papers weredominated by the rain that wiped out all play Tuesday at the Wimbledon tennischampionships and by an administrative fiasco at the government Passport Agency,which has left more than half a million people due to travel abroad within thenext four weeks waiting for passports.            Withthe Princess Diana museum reopening Thursday, her birthday, for its secondsummer season at Althorp, her family home in England, the Daily Telegraph reported that some 25,000 tickets still remain unsold,whereas last year all 150,000 tickets were snatched up before opening day. Thisis one of a number of recent indications that Diana fever has declinedsubstantially. The Times reported that her brother, Earl Spencer, isconsidering breaking his ties with the memorial fund through which the proceedsfrom the museum have until now been channeled for charitable purposes, whilefrom New York, the Daily Express reported a plan to build the world'sfirst permanent monument to the late princess on a three-acre site in CentralPark.
