                                 Economic Data: An Infinite Loop                        Everyone knows--or at least we're supposed to know--that the market for U.S.stocks today is dominated by momentum traders, day traders, and technicaltraders, none of whom are paying attention to the underlying fundamentals ofthe companies whose shares they're buying and selling, and all of whom areputting the U.S. economy at risk by converting the stock market into anelaborate shell game/pyramid scheme.            As it happens, this is wrong. There are lots of momentum traders and daytraders and technical traders, but there always have been, and in any case theincreased volume on the stock market and the greater number of traders hasalmost certainly made stock prices more efficient and more accurate indicatorsof underlying value than they once were.            What's interesting about this, though, is that the same picture is veryrarely drawn of the bond market, even though if you talk to (or listen to) bondtraders, what you mostly hear is a host of technical information--stuff aboutthe trend of bond prices over the last month or last week, about support levelsthat bond prices have to hold or break through, and about overbought/oversoldindicators that are or are not flashing green or red. And you also get a lot ofrapid reaction to things like Alan Greenspan speeches or employment-cost-indexnumbers. The conventional image of bondholders is that they're conservative,long-term, careful investors. (Why else would you be content with a 6.3 percentyield for 30 long years.) But bond traders are as manic--no, more manic- thantheir counterparts in the equity market.            This doesn't mean that the bond market is any less efficient than the stockmarket, though it does seem a bit curious. But what bond traders' reliance ontechnical analysis--the idea that future price movements can be deduced bystudying the patterns of past price movements--speaks to is just how impossibleit is to successfully predict a market in which every piece of potentialinformation seems to point in two different directions at once, and in whichthere seems to be nothing that doesn't count as potential information.            Take today's trade-deficit number. Although it was the third worst in U.S.history, it was still weaker than expected and smaller than last month's tradedeficit. That was good news for the U.S. dollar, which rallied, and since bondshave--at least recently--been following the dollar, it might have been goodnews for the bond market. On the other hand, a weaker trade deficit meant thatU.S. exports were up sharply, which means that people were working more andfactories were producing more, which probably means higher growth and,potentially, higher inflation. That seems like it would be bad news forbondholders, who hate inflation.            But then you had to consider that imports actually rose 2 percent,suggesting that the American consumer is still buying foreign goods freely andthat potential inflation from the weaker dollar (which would drive up the priceof foreign goods) hasn't had much of an impact. So maybe inflation is stillreally just a mirage. But wait. If U.S. exports are up, that must mean thatforeign demand is rebounding, and since the slump of the rest of the globaleconomy has helped keep commodity prices down, a global rebound could haveinflationary implications. So that could be bad news.            Then you have to divide the import side of the trade deficit ledger intonon-commodity and commodity goods, particularly since oil-price hikes had a bigimpact in the last month. And you probably want to take a look at capitalflows, too. And then there's ...            This is all fascinating (no, really, it is), but it is also a Moebius strip,in which it's difficult to tell where anything begins or ends. And we haven'teven taken into account that the bond market needs to interpret not only allthese numbers but also what impact the numbers will have on the Fed, and thenin turn what impact the Fed's interpretation of the data will have on futurenumbers.            Given all that, it's not too surprising that the bond market preferred tomeander around today, basically ending where it began. Set yourself theimpossible task of predicting a macroeconomic future, and your head will startto hurt, too.
