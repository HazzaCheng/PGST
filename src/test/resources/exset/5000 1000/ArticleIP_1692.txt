                                 Tripp to China                                        GET"PUNDIT CENTRAL" BY E-MAIL!                                       For Monday morningdelivery of Pundit Central, plus "Today's Papers" (daily) and "InternationalPapers" (Tuesday and Friday), click here.                        Issue 1 is the Chinesetelecast of President Clinton's sharp comments to Jiang Zemin. Sometimesgleefully, sometimes grudgingly, the commentariat pronounces Saturday'stelecast an important victory for the United States and Clinton. This week'sobligatory opining on Issue 2-- l'affaire Lewinsky --centers on theupcoming grand jury testimony of Linda Tripp.            Just intime for the Sunday shows, Clinton criticized the crackdown in Tiananmen andChina's general approach to human rights. The televised criticism will have along-lasting effect, believes Sam Donaldson (ABC's This Week ): "You leta little freedom get started, you can't stop it." "Great stuff," agrees BritHume ( Fox News Sunday ). Robert Novak (CNN's Capital Gang ) is"very proud of the president," though he believes China's evolution into a freestate will not be sped by lectures.            Many pundits note that at the outset the trip smelled likea public relations disaster (China refused visas to Radio Free Asiacorrespondents and arrested several Chinese dissidents). Steve Roberts (CNN'sLate Edition ) called it "sticking a finger in the president's eye."Nevertheless, the televised debate "redeemed" Clinton in the eyes of MaraLiasson ( Fox News Sunday ). But a few critical voices point out that thedecision to broadcast the debate was Jiang's, not Clinton's--further evidencethat Clinton is Jiang's stooge (Cokie Roberts and George Stephanopoulus,This Week ; Hume; Steve Roberts).            TheRepublican-Democrat role reversal on China policy amazes Steve Roberts--the GOPtalks about human rights while Dems defend business interests. "It's actuallyenough to make your head spin," agrees Tucker Carlson ( Late Edition ).Margaret Carlson ( Capital Gang ) charges that conservatives professsupport for human rights over commerce just to court votes. Conservatives knowthat they won't alienate their true constituency--big business--becauseconservatives don't control the White House and therefore have no foreignpolicy teeth. "The farther you are away from power, the more likely you are tobash China," says Carlson.            The commentariat doesn't have much that is newto say about Issue 2-- l'affaire Lewinsky . Everyone thinks that MonicaLewinsky's long awaited testimony is just around the corner. Everyone seemstired of waiting. John McLaughlin ( The McLaughlin Group ) complains thatClinton gets to take a vacation in August while the opinion mafia must hangaround swampy Washington just because a new wrinkle might break.            The only new development isthe revelation that Tripp will testify next week. Eleanor Clift ( TheMcLaughlin Group ) thinks the timing is suspect--it may be an attempt tosteal Clinton's China thunder. Let's not forget that Clinton rescheduled theChina trip to coincide with the expected Paula Jones trial date, points outHume. Tripp's testimony will be a "bombshell," says Stephanopoulus. Tripp'stestimony is proof that Starr's inquiry is coming to a close, say others.(Caveat emptor: the same voices that have been predicting a close formonths.)            Al Hunt( Capital Gang ) alleges that Starr is an out of control prosecutor. Novakattacks the president for his tactics of delay. This is an argument that Novakand Hunt have been having since Day 1 of the scandal.                           Won't This Hurt Tony Blair's Feelings?Most of the Sunday shows begin with a brief news report on the China tripdelivered by a foreign correspondent. Generally, correspondents strike an airof stern impartiality, just as on the evening news. But not Fox NewsSunday 's Jim Angle, who reports, "Jiang went toe-to-toe with Bill Clinton,the smoothest talker in the Western world."                           Pundits Get It Right:Pundit Central, responding to reader mail, has decided to keep stats on theopinion mafia. Last week, Eleanor Clift predicted that China would detarget itsmissiles, and Michael Barone predicted the outcome of Colombia's election. Lastmonth, Paul Gigot guessed that Clinton's scandal would not be resolved duringJune. All three are correct and earn a point each, though Gigot loses half apoint for scoring on a bunt.                           --BruceGottlieb
