DearDeborah,            Last time we chatted, it was in the TriBeCa loft ofthe abstract painter Melissa Meyer, at one of her Sunday teas, and like herwork and her friends, our conversation was eminently civilized and stimulating.I must say I'd rather spend the next couple of days thinking and writing about,and hearing your views about, a single picture by Meyer than every piece byevery artist in the "Sensation" show at the Brooklyn Museum. Even though I'myoung and British myself, born on the same day as Rachel Whiteread, as ithappens, I have to confess to being as profoundly alienated from the YBAs asthey seem to be from the kind of art that turns me on. From the kind of art, ina word, that is about "little sensations" as Czanne called them, rather thanthe tabloid sensationalism in which the Brooklyn show wallows.            Of course, however wonderfully and sensitively youand I were to write about one abstract painting, there is no denying that tothe average reader--even indeed to the committed art aficionado--a two-daydebate about Meyer's (or anyone's) use of pink would get a little wearisome.Whereas we could get hotter and hotter under the collar about the ethics ofdisplaying one man's collection of new art in a public institution, of publicsubsidy for art the public is goaded into hating, of how blasphemy has becomean article of faith in an institutionalized avant garde, etc. etc. Forjournalists--even for respectable critics like you and me--"Sensation"is great copy.            I know                   Slate                wants us to talk aboutthe art in Brooklyn, not the kerfuffle surrounding it (and hats off to them forwanting it so) but one point has to be made: It is irksome when art becomes amoral cause. It is as if during a fencing match someone were to start hurlingbombs. It polarizes debate in such a way that aesthetic discernments becomeirrelevant. When mayors and clergymen and animal-rights activists startweighing in, the issues become freedom of expression, the meaning of images,the ownership of icons (does the Virgin belong to the Church or to everyonetouched by the concept?) etc., all fascinating issues, but leaving anyoneconcerned with art obliged to argue for basic artists' rights rather thanattending to more localized and interesting issues, like is Chris Ofili anygood? But this in turn raises another issue: Does Ofili want us to ask whetherhe is any good, or does he not short-circuit the evaluative process by makingart contrived to raise hell with Catholics and excite a frisson ofold-time anticlericalism in the rest of us?            It seems to me absurd to try and read an image likeThe Holy Virgin Mary 1996 in purely formal terms, because it would be toapply aesthetic criteria and art-historical comparisons to a work that drawsits power primarily from iconoclasm and irreverence. Ofili wants, surely, to beraw, crude, angry, Bad. It doesn't do much good to come along and say, well,the encrustation of cut-out porno photos has a decorative quality that recallsGustave Moreau's overloaded, quasi- (queasy) mystical images of the (last)fin de sicle ? Better would be to compare and contrast it with otherart brut and with other blasphemous imagery. In respect of the former,it competes with Dubuffet, and of the latter with Buuel, Dal, Max Ernst. I'mthinking of Ernst's mock Renaissance altarpiece of the Virgin spanking the HolyInfant with the artist, Breton, and I think luard as witnesses. On bothcounts, prewar anti-clericalism and postwar apocalyptic angst gave theSurrealists and Dubuffet, respectively, historic urgency lacking in thegratuitous neo-primitivism of Ofili. Unless we want to argue that Ofili's artis about the loss of center that gives meaning to the kind of gestureshe deploys.            The problem remains: Dowe, should we, bother with evaluative comparisons and contextualizationswith an artist like Chris Ofili whose agenda seems to be anti-aesthetic, andwhose context is much more the current sensations of pop music and fashion withwhich he vies in terms of energy and verve, than the old masters, the "strongand durable" art admired by Czanne in the Louvre, and by many of us in thepermanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum?            Bestto you,            David
