                                 Jefferson: Declaration of Dependents                           USAToday leads with last night's Democratic and Republican New Hampshiredebates, which it describes as "personal and combative." The debates also topthe Wall Street Journal front-page news box. TheNew York Times goes with anexclusive: the belief of American investigators that there are some people (oneof whom is now in custody in Senegal) who are connected to both Osama Bin Ladenand to the Algerians arrested late last year apparently in the midst ofcarrying out one or more bomb plots against targets in the U.S. The Washington Post leads with the Labor Department'sdefinitive position on the issue of what sort of home work activities mustcomply with federal workplace health and safety regulations, a position takenafter the Labor Department first said all such activities were covered and thenlater said in effect, never mind. The new rule: Ordinary white-collar work in ahousehold is not covered, but hazardous manufacturing work there is. TheLos AngelesTimes leads with the latest in the city's mushrooming police scandal:The LAPD chief's call for the quick dismissal of the cases against 99 people inwhich the arrests were based on officers' documented illegal activity, rangingfrom lying to unprovoked shooting. At least three of those people are in jailright now.                           USAT 's lead includes new New Hampshire polling that finds JohnMcCain leading George W. Bush 43 percent to 36 percent and Al Gore ahead ofBill Bradley 53 percent to 44 percent. The story states the margin of error (4percent for the Republicans, 5 percent for the Democrats) but forgets to tellthe size of the sample. The NYT reports that some pollsters have gottentogether to form a Polling Review Board that will monitor and discuss the floodof political polls expected during the upcoming election season. One focus ofthe organization will be scrutinizing and debunking online polls.            The headlines over the papers' debate stories suggest that the press candetect sub-atomic levels of emotion. "Two Democrats Fire Broadsides in TestyDebate," says the NYT . "Sparks Fly in Two Candidate Debates," says theLAT .            The WP , NYT , and LAT front yesterday's meeting in Miamiof Elin Gonzlez with his Cuban grandmothers. USAT puts it inside. Butall the papers front a picture of the boy. The NYT 's pic shows himsmiling. The picture used by both USAT and the Post has himlooking positively exuberant, making what looks like a peace sign with eachhand, although, let's face it, at that age, it's probably bunny ears. TheLAT , on the other hand, runs a shot of him looking glum.                           USAT fronts, and the other papers stuff, the finding announcedyesterday by the foundation that maintains Thomas Jefferson's home and thepreponderance of documentary materials relating to him, that, yes, he almostsurely fathered one of his slave Sally Hemings' six children and probably allsix of them.            The WP reports that the Department of Energy has admitted that nearly15,000 pages about U.S. nuclear weapon designs in the 1950s and '60s weremistakenly declassified and that on at least one occasion were accessed by anoutside researcher. But the outside researcher was not apparently a Postreporter--the story doesn't say when the papers were released nor who got alook at them.            A letter to the NYT observes that Bill Bradley is demonstrating goodsense in at least one concrete area: He's been wearing a hat while campaigningin New Hampshire, while, judging by newspaper pictures, Al Gore and George W.Bush seem to go hatless there. Today's Papers has a suggestion for poolreporters scratching their heads about what to ask the front-runners: "Sir, yousay you're willing to do the right thing even if it makes you look bad in themedia. How can we believe that when, even in freezing weather, to look good youwon't wear a hat?"
