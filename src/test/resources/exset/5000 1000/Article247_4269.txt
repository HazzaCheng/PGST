                                 God in Search of Sally Quinn            Last week, Culturebox had an important insight into the nature of Americanspirituality. She would like to share it with you today. The revelationoccurred while she was reading a remarkable column by Sally Quinn in theWashington Post about labyrinths.Labyrinths, for thosewho don't follow trends in New Age healing, are the hot new form of meditation.You march around in them, you get lost, and you find yourself on a higherplane. They are often built by churches as a way to lure people back into thefold, and by spas as a higher form of relaxation, sort of like water aerobics.Many people spent their New Year's Eve walking in labyrinths, rather thanpursuing more conventional paths to transcendence, such as champagne and foiegras.            Quinn walked her first labyrinth when she was a guest at the Golden Door, aspa for society ladies in Southern California. She was dubious at first, butthe staff insisted, and it was a truly transforming experience. Sheconcentrated on some tests her learning-disabled son was taking at that verymoment back in Washington. Later, she discovered that though he'd done poorlyon most portions of the test, he had scored off the charts on one: "The maze."This was her first step toward conversion, but what really moved her was aphotograph taken of a woman who had just walked a maze for the first time.We'll let Marylin Arrigan tell this story in her own words, or at least Quinn'swords:                           "Suddenly," [Arrigan] says, "I was in a very bright light. I had avision of an Indian face with long straight hair, blowing in the wind. He haduplifted arms. He kept telling me to look up. I kept looking up. I was engulfedin light.                                       "He asked if I was committed to walking the labyrinth. I said 'yes.'He said, 'If you are, you must leave a footprint.' When I got to the center Ileft two deep footprints. As I was walking out he said, 'Now you are walkingout, you must go out in the world and leave a footprint.'               "                                       ... Arrigan can't explain her vision. "I was in tears on and off. Itwas like a roller coaster. But toward the end I was very calm, it was like apeace. Like I had a mission."                        Skeptical? Quinn has the clincher:                           A volunteer, Carol Davis, tookpictures with a digital camera as they were finishing up. Flipping through theimages, she stopped, stunned, at a shot of the group. For there, in the centerof the picture, was what looked like a brilliant shaft of multicolored light,coming from above and directed exactly at Arrigan.                        The Washington Post photo department, says Quinn,thinks that the "brilliant shaft of multicolored light" is lens flare. ButQuinn disagrees. The experience gave Arrigan and Quinn a sense of higherpurpose, and what else do you need to know?             Very little. Once upon a time, religionin America was a terrifying, finger-pointing, hellfire-and-brimstone affair.God didn't come to you; you went to God, or else. Insofar as there was lifeoutside the church, it was secondary. Religious doctrine was dense anddifficult and if you misunderstood it, you could be excommunicated or jailed.Now, though, everything is different. Religion isn't mean and threatening. Itdoesn't demand all your time. You can fit it into your busy schedule. If youneed a "mission," as Arrigan says, you just do whatever you're already doing,as long as you can coax from it some movement of the soul. A socialite andjournalist such as Sally Quinn can have her spiritual moments along with heraromatherapy and massage, and find proof of God in newspaper photos. Interiordesigners and writers for home decor magazines can take up feng shui, theancient Chinese art of object placement. Woody Harrelson can adopt tantric sex.Gym trainers can practice yoga. Football coaches can preach the religion ofsports. Culturebox, whose job it is to write articles that are short, isplanning to devote herself to kabala, a form of Jewish mysticism, weirdly madepopular by Madonna and Roseanne, in which one finds a deeper meaning in small,seemingly insignificant words and individual letters.
