                                 Don't Believe the Hype                        Dear Kara,            OK, I'll bite. How will the Internet become the "most importantcommunications medium of all time"? How will it sweep away ignorance aboutracial hatred or empower people to take control of their lives? It seems to methat the Internet can foment hate and/or the herd mentality just as easily atit can foment tolerance and/or empowerment. I have to put my cards on the tablehere: I'm really skeptical of the claims that I hear all around me about howthe Internet is going to change the world as we know it.            Let me lay out some of the reasons for my skepticism. First, from a purelyhistorical point of view, I don't see how anyone can view the Internet as moreimportant than any number of communications media that have preceded it: theprinting press, the telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph player, thetelevision among them. To my mind, the Internet is demonstrably lessimportant--less transforming, if you will--than any of these predecessors.Secondly, more often than not, powerful new technologies don't live up to theirsupposed "true" potential. Here, of course, television is the prime example.Look back at the claims that were made for television during its formativeyears, and they sound a lot like the claims being made now for the Internet.Would anyone claim today that television has changed our society? Well, yes,they would--but not in the enlightened fashion that its proselytizers had oncehoped.            I know you're not supposed to say this out loud--at least not on arespectable Web site like this one--but I think the Internet has a way ofbringing out the worst in people rather than the best. The anonymity it allowsemboldens people to say things to each other they would never say face to face.There are at least as many sites for nuts as there are for people trying tomake the world a better place. Everything has to be short and quick. And evensome Web ideas that started out as utopian have been subverted over time. Theexample I know best is that of the chat rooms devoted to particular stocks,which were supposed to be informative, illuminating places, filled withlike-minded investors trying to help each other and educate each other aboutstocks. And what happened? Chat rooms have become astonishingly intolerantplaces, where anyone who dares dissent from the general rah-rah tenor isbranded a traitor and pretty much hounded out of the site. As you know, they'vealso become havens for fraud, abuse, and all sorts of dirty shenanigans. Two orthree years ago, I made a point of checking the chat room whenever I began astory about a particular company. Now I don't bother; it's just a waste oftime.            I'll go a step further.            Even from a business point of view--which is the focus of most of the hypethese days--I think the Web is more likely to disappoint than not. Withoutquestion, companies like Amazon.com are eating into the profits of "bricks andmortar" companies like Barnes & Noble, and will undoubtedly continue to doso. But the reason Amazon's stock is such a high-flyer is that there is awidespread expectation that someday Amazon will be a gigantically profitablecorporation itself. But why will this ever happen? There will always be someother Web site offering consumers a better deal than Amazon--get a free PC withthe purchase of your next book!--and the Web allows consumers something thathas heretofore existed only in economics textbooks: "perfect knowledge"--theability to know every price that exists for the good you want to buy. That'sempowerment, all right; no question about it. But it's not the kind ofempowerment Internet stock analysts like to talk about. So do I use theInternet? All the time. It's part of my life. The past few weeks, in fact, Iwas on vacation on a lake in Canada, where I had little access to television orAmerican newspapers. I spent a little time each day logging on to the NewYork Times ,                   Slate               , and Yahoo!, just to see what wasgoing on. I was glad I could do it. But is that an earth-shattering advance? Idon't think so. Needless to say (he hastens to add) all of the above is offeredin the spirit of good, healthy debate. Glad I got that out of my system,though. Looking forward to tomorrow's correspondence.            Best,Joe
