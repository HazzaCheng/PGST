Monday's Question(No. 231)-- "Ultracolossal":                                       An announcement Sunday roiled the world of the superjumbo. Who plans todo what?

Well, I'm sure as hell not buying Jumboanymore!!"-- Dale Shuger                        Clickfor more answers.                           Randy's FatWrap-Up                        Posing this question meant risking fat jokes, butmercifully most of you steered clear. The fat joke assumes that the body is aphysical manifestation of the mind, an outward sign of inward gracelessness. Itassumes that weight is volitional, that the fat person chooses to be fat--i.e.,lazy, greedy, undisciplined, self-indulgent--and thus ought to be mocked. Notso, of course. Like most things about the human body, genetics play all tooindomitable a part. Unless the human is Pamela Anderson. She's still classifiedas human, right? After the surgery and all?            Much is made of themodern focus on weight, but it's an old form of unkindness. In George Orwell's1938 novel Coming up for Air , the protagonist muses on how years of suchmockery transform a man:                           I've been both fat and thin in my life, andI know the difference fatness makes to our outlook. It kind of prevents youfrom taking things too hard. I doubt whether a man who's never been anythingbut fat, a man who's been called Fatty ever since he could walk, even knows ofthe existence of any really deep emotions. How could he? He's got no experienceof such things. He can't ever be present at a tragic scene, because a scenewhere there's a fat man present isn't tragic, it's comic. Just imagine a fatHamlet, for instance! Or Oliver Hardy acting Romeo.                        This was, of course, notmeant to be good news. But what is?                           Massive Capacityfor Everything Except Pleasure Answer                        Boeing may develop an 800-passenger airplane.            Fending off rival Airbus Industrie, the Seattlecompany will invest $3 billion either to build a 550-seat version of its 747 orto start from scratch on something even bigger and more uncomfortable. Currentversions of the 747 seat between 272 and 386 passengers, depending onconfiguration and how much the pilot is distracted by pathetic whimpering akinto that of caged animals.            In a countermove, Airbus today announced plans tobuild the A318, a 107-seat passenger jet that will pose a challenge to Boeing's737, a still-popular commuter plane derived from 1960's technology.            And in a countermove to superjumbo fat jokes, theFood and Drug Administration has approved Hoffman-LaRoche's orlistat, the firstin a new class of anti-obesity drugs that block the body's absorption ofdietary fat.
