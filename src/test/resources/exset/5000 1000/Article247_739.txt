                                 Economy Not Spooked            All papers--the New York Times , the Los AngelesTimes , and the Washington Post --lead with the U.S. economy's surprisinglystrong third-quarter growth rate in the face of the world financial crisis. Asmeasured in July-September, the rate was 3.3 percent, up from 1.8% in thesecond quarter (and far exceeding the 2% gain the NYT reports wasforecast by Wall Street).            The data, released by the Commerce Department Friday, is treated by all witha blend of optimism and caution. While the Dow Jones pulled a John Glenn androcketed up 97 points, most experts predict that the economy will slow nextyear. All papers report that exports fell. The NYT and LAT reportthat consumer spending rose at a 3.9% rate, below the rate for the first sixmonths of the year (6.1%, though neither mentions it). Meanwhile, the WPgoofs by reporting that the consumer spending rose at a 2.6% rate in the thirdquarter, down from 4% in the first six months. Interpretations as well asnumbers differ. The NYT , which calls the consumer spending numbers "veryrobust," is less discouraged by the declining rate than the WP andLAT , which both emphasize that consumer confidence is sliding. Anotherinterpretive discrepancy: The analysts consulted by the WP say that theFed will probably still reduce short-term interests rates in November, but theLAT and the NYT say that such Fed action is now less likely. Onlythe NYT article points out that the economy's growth supplies theDemocrats with pre-election pep-rally material.            In other economic news (fronted by the NYT ; enfolded into the leadLAT story), the Group of Seven industrial nations announced theirsupport yesterday for President Clinton's plan to provide IMF loans toeconomies vulnerable to Asia's malaise. The G-7 also outlined some new reformsfor the IMF, such as charging high interest on IMF loans to encourage promptpayback.            Eleven judges from Spain's National Court voted unanimously that Spain hasthe right to bring criminal charges against former Chilean dictator Gen.Augusto Pinochet, and seek his extradition from Britain. This unprecedenteddecision directly contradicts the British High Court's ruling this week. Anappeal is pending, and the NYT notes that Spain's action may give moreimpetus for Britain to overturn its ruling.            As all papers report inside, documents released yesterday show that onSeptember 25 the Lewinsky grand jury judge ordered a special investigation ofKenneth Starr's office for leak violations. The ruling cited 24 news stories asevidence of possible leak violations. The special investigator--whose name isbeing kept secret--was given the authority to hire a staff and subpoenatestimony and documents from the independent counsel's office.            A NYT front-pager headlined "Candidates Deploy Wives as Evidence of Constancy" adds aninteresting twist to the pre-election ad wars: Candidates (especially olderDemocrats) are putting their wives on the air essentially to inform voters howlong they have been (faithfully?) married. Among the venerable couples: Kenneth& Anne MacKay from Florida: 39 years; Roy & Mary Barnes from Georgia:28 years; Mike & Kathy Simpson of Idaho: also 28 years.            The WP fronts an interesting story on a joint U.S.-Chinese secretelectronic surveillance system established in 1995 alongthe China-Burma border to eavesdrop on narcotics traffickers. The specifics ofthe surveillance station are intriguingly murky: It is tiny, staffed by lessthan a dozen people (mostly or all Chinese), and possibly mobile. Theinterceptor device is "run by the CIA" (whatever that means), but theintelligence generated has helped Chinese officials to crack at least fourcases--each involving over 220 pounds of heroin.            The NYT runs a long feature on the Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Florida. Thesespooky events, which have been going on since October 2, feature everythingfrom a Chain Saw Drill Team lurking outside the haunted houses to a derangeddentist who brushes with unsuspecting visitors. Although the NYTgood-naturedly complains that "Universal executives here are almost astight-lipped as Frankenstein's monster," the paper estimates that the HalloweenHorror Nights bring in $11 million in revenues for Universal.
