                                 Idiot Box: New Year's Week  Edition                           All times areEastern, but check your local listings just in case.                        Thanks god it's over. Holiday hell is behind us now,and things appear to be looking up--at least on TV. The repeats are fewer, themovies are better, the flood of gooey holiday commercials is drying up--they'reeven showing back-to-back Ally on Fox (Mon., 8:00 & 9:00p.m.).            Leading off the week, there's good news for everyonestill in a funk over Frank Sinatra's passing: A&E has put together aswingin' two-part, four-hour Biography on the Rat Pack (Part 1, Sun.,8:00 p.m.). Centered around the rise, fall, and redemption of the Chairman ofthe Board, the documentary is chock full of fascinating details about how thevarious Packsters were drawn into Sinatra's orbit, starting in the early 1940s.Even RP aficionados will swoon over the old photos and footage of not onlyFrank, Dean, Sammy, Peter, and Joey (who does not make an appearance until hourthree), but also of such silver-screen notables as Ava Gardner, HumphreyBogart, Lauren Bacall, Lana Turner, Clark Gable, and Montgomery Clift. Thereare also terrific vintage clips of kangaroo boxers on Atlantic City'sboardwalk, the Peter Lawford-Pat Kennedy nuptials, and the Kefauver Senatehearings on organized crime.            Attempts to weave the five men's stories togetherresult in some confusing chronological jumps, but the damage isn't serious. Onesour note: actor Danny Aiello's voice-over. In theory, he's a logical choice--alow-key Italian-American who sounds like he could have been one of Frank's mobchums. In practice, he stinks up the joint. Admittedly, the script is no prize,but Aiello compounds the problem, droning along as if under the influence ofprescription drugs.            This week's movie scene offers something foreveryone. Monday at 9:00 p.m., Bravo is running the Academy Award-winningCinema Paradiso , while CBS goes for mass appeal with Sleepless inSeattle . In need of more manly fare? Tuesday, TNT delivers a Clintdouble-header: High Plains Drifter (8:00 p.m.) followed by Fistful ofDollars (10:05 p.m.). And late in the week, Fox Family Channel is showingWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape (Fri., 9:00 p.m.), in which Johnny Depp isannoyingly beautiful, and Juliette Lewis is simply annoying. But the movie ischarming despite itself, and a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio earned an Oscarnomination for his convincing turn as Depp's mentally retardedbrother.            For those not completely overdosed on reruns, there'sa special Thursday showing of Just Shoot Me (NBC, 8:30 p.m.). This isthe episode in which Finch (David Spade) tries to trick Maya (Laura SanGiacomo) into engaging in "forbidden love" with another woman--while hewatches. Discovering Finch's plan, the women plot revenge, devising a list ofimpossible tasks that Finch must accomplish in order for the love-fest to takeplace. The hysterical part is watching Spade's character actually accomplishhis mission with the aid and encouragement of several dozen strangers--all menwho are desperate to help Finch live out "Every Man's Fantasy." It's funnybecause it's true.            Next week also brings the return of Al Franken'sdubious sit-com, Lateline (NBC, Wed., 9:00 p.m.). Before it was shelvedlast year, the show was populated by weak characters--Franken's Al Freundlichwas a total boob--and riddled with tired gags (e.g., Freundlich's shriekingharpy of a wife, whom we hear only over the phone.) For the relaunch, I washoping the series' writers had done a major creative overhaul, but the earlysigns are not encouraging. This week's show--in which anchorman Pearce McKenzie(Robert Foxworth) starts doing guest spots on the Conan O'Brien show--is justplain stupid, relying heavily on dopey sight gags and potty humor. The episodehas some nice moments--mostly involving an intern's desperate pursuit of araise--but overall, it feels like a second-rate Murphy Brown.            Other questionable programming this week: Sunday, ABCis showing D3: The Mighty Ducks (8:00 p.m.), in which Emilio Estevez'sscrappy young hockey heroes face their grimmest challenge yet--Prep Schoolers.In the history of film, there are perhaps 10 sequels that deserved to be made.This is not one of them. Monday at 8:00 p.m., NBC is premiering The WrongGirl , some bizarre made-for-TV deal starring country-music singer BarbaraMandrell as a concerned mom who suspects that her son's new girlfriend is adangerous psychotic. And perhaps most disheartening, UPN continues to airepisodes of Love Boat: The Next Wave .            Where is a giant iceberg when you really needit?            -- Michelle Cottle
