                                  Praise the Lord, Pass the Ammo            Addressing a "God Not Guns" rally of ministers nearthe Capitol a couple of weeks ago, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay offered thisexplanation for the Littleton, Colo., killings: "I got an e-mail this morningthat said it all. The student writes, 'Dear God: Why didn't you stop theshootings at Columbine?' And God writes, 'Dear student: I would have, but Iwasn't allowed in school.' "            The view amongRepublicans is that adolescent violence is inevitable given the decline ofreligion. Indeed, until the early 1960s' Supreme Court decisions on schoolprayer, displays of the Ten Commandments were common. And back then, crime wasmuch less prevalent than today. So, the House voted to undo the "damage" byallowing states to mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments in schools andother public facilities.            In social science terms, the Republicans believe there is acorrelation between the influence of religion and obedience to the law. The TenCommandments prohibit murder, so exposing people to them could tend todiscourage lethal violence. The absence of religious faith and norms, on theother hand, might incline someone toward homicide. The argument has particularforce in the context of Columbine, where the gunmen asked two girls if theybelieved in God, and when they answered affirmatively, shot them dead.            The correlation is notimplausible, but a correlation is not the same thing as a cause. If we were todiscover that none of the killers in the various school shootings were in thehabit of eating pancakes for breakfast, we would have established acorrelation. But no one would argue that the kids killed because they didn'teat enough pancakes--much less that the answer to school violence is a nationalcampaign to get children to eat pancakes every day. Once you find a correlationbetween A and B, you still have to demonstrate that one causes the other.            In this instance, though, conservatives are claiming tohave found a cause without even showing a correlation. Why not? Maybe becausethey can't. The United States is the most religious of all the industrializednations. Forty-four percent of Americans attend church once a week, comparedwith 27 percent in Britain, 21 percent in France, 16 percent in Australia, and4 percent in Sweden. Yet violent crime is not less common in the UnitedStates--it's more common. The murder rate here is six times higher than therate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than inAustralia, and five times higher than in Sweden. Japan, where Christianity hasalmost no adherents, has less violent crime than almost any country. There area few advanced nations that have high rates of church attendance and low ratesof violent crime--Ireland, Italy, and Belgium--but they're the exceptions.            Within the 50 states,there is no evidence that a God-fearing populace equals a law-abiding populace.The Bible Belt has more than its share of both praying and killing. Louisianahas the highest churchgoing rate in the country, but its murder rate is morethan twice the national average. The same pattern generally holds in the restof the South. Tom DeLay's Bible-toting state of Texas has a murder rate triplethat of Massachusetts, which is "ungodly" enough to have elected two openly gaymembers of Congress. New York, the very symbol of godless depravity, isperfectly average when it comes to extralegal slaughter. In Washington state,where Sunday morning slugabeds are more common than anywhere else in America,murder is 38 percent less common.            House Republicans have also failed to notice that theschool shootings have not occurred in hotbeds of secular humanism--say,Berkeley, Calif.; Cambridge, Mass; or New York City--but in towns that NormanRockwell and James Dobson would be proud to call home. Pearl, Miss.; WestPaducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; Edinboro, Pa.; and Springfield, Ore., are notexactly Madalyn Murray O'Hair country. Littleton was fertile ground forevangelical churches.            If there is any apparent correlation between theprevalence of Christian devotion and law-abiding conduct, it's the opposite ofthe one claimed by Republicans: Religion and violence seem to go hand in hand.That doesn't mean faith actually causes murder. But it does suggest that whenRepublicans contemplate the Ten Commandments, they should pay more attention tothe ninth, which prohibits false witness.
