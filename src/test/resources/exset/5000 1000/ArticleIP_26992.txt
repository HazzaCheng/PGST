                                  Speeding While Sober            On March 15, John Stokes piloted histractor-trailer in front of an Amtrak train at a rail crossing in Bourbonnais,Ill. In the ensuing collision, 11 people were killed. His commercial licensewas suspended for all of two months. His right to drive his car fornoncommercial purposes was unaffected. Even this wrist slap only happened afterit came out that Stokes had had at least nine moving violations since1991--three of them last year.            So why is he allowed on the road at all? Answer:because he broke the law while stone cold sober. Had Stokes been cited evenonce for driving drunk--even without an accident, even without violating anytraffic rule--he automatically would have lost his right to drive for sixmonths. A second offense would have cost him a year's driving, and a thirdwould have sent him to jail.            Why the difference? Alcohol is the leading cause oftraffic fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration, contributing to more than 16,000 deaths each year, making up 30percent of all fatalities on the road. But speed comes in a very respectablesecond, killing 13,000 Americans annually.            Today, drunken driversrank as one notch above child molesters in the popular mind. But attitudesabout driving while intoxicated were not always so negative. Twenty years ago,it was still widely accepted as harmless high jinks. Only in the 1980s, thanksto campaigns by Mothers Against Drunk Driving, did Americans come to recognizethe vast toll of drunks on the road. As a result, we've stiffened penalties,raised the drinking age from 18 to 21, mandated license revocation for minorscaught driving after drinking any amount of alcohol and, in 16 states,tightened the blood-alcohol standard for drunkenness. Deaths in alcohol-relatedcrashes fell 32 percent between 1982 and 1997.            When it comes to speed, though, the attitude is: Party on!In 1995, Congress dropped all federal restrictions on highway speed limits(first imposed during the 1970s energy crisis), letting states set the maximumwherever they pleased. Radar detectors, whose sole purpose is to help motoristsbreak the law with impunity, are legal for cars in 49 states. (Virginia is theexception.) How long would legislators tolerate the sale of a device to foil aBreathalyzer?            The Insurance Institutefor Highway Safety reports that after the repeal of 55-mph speed limits,fatalities rose by 17 percent on interstate highways where the limit wasraised. More people driving faster means more slaughter on the roads. But thebloodshed by speeders doesn't evoke the same emotional revulsion as thebloodshed by drunks.            Why not? One explanation is that most people don't everdrive while intoxicated, while most do exceed the speed limit from time totime. Any movement for social reform is more effective if it pillories a smallminority and leaves the majority unaccused and unaffected.            People don't believe that excessive speed is asrisky as excessive drink. They think it is possible for an experienced andcompetent driver (such as themselves) to go fast without hurting anyone. Thisis, in fact, possible. It is also possible to drive drunk without causing anaccident. Every night the vast majority of drunken drivers get home safely. Butwe don't accept that as a defense. We understand that however able the driver,the risk of this type of behavior is serious and intolerable. We treat theculprits as potential killers who need to be restrained from endangering theinnocent.            Our attitudes about serious speeding have yet tocome to grips with simple reality. Car magazines and auto commercials continueto not merely excuse but celebrate behavior that kills almost as many Americansannually as died in the Vietnam War during its bloodiest year, while maimingand injuring thousands more. If we were to crack down on speeding as vigorouslyas we did on drunken driving--by mandating license suspensions for repeatoffenders, imposing jail time on incorrigibles, and outlawing radardetectors--we could make the roads far safer. The drunken driving crusadereduced alcohol-related deaths by a third. A comparable commitment on speedcould save more than 4,000 lives every year.
