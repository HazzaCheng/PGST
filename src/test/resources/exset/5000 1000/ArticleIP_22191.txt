                                  The Wealth of Stein            A year ago I was living ina $150,000 apartment, which I owned. It was a small, two-room apartment. Now Iam living in a $175,000 apartment, which I own. It is also a small two-roomapartment. In fact, it is the same apartment, although a little shabbier. Ayear ago I could have sold the apartment for $150,000. Now I can sell it for$175,000.            Am I richer? I wouldhave $25,000 more in cash if I sold today vs. a year ago. But money is asterile thing, good only for what it will buy. Today's $175,000 will buy 62,724packages of Product 19, whereas last year's $150,000 would have bought only53,763 packages, so I am richer in Product 19. I do not, however, live onProduct 19 alone.            We are accustomed to the idea that we should convert alldollar amounts to "real" values by adjusting with the consumer price index.Because the CPI rose by 1.7 percent in the past year (January to January), thevalue of my apartment rose by only 14.7 percent in terms of the goods andservices included in the CPI, rather than the 16.6 percent by which it rose interms of dollars.            But if I sell myapartment, I probably won't use the proceeds to buy that month's assortment ofstuff that's in the CPI. I will probably want to buy some other asset that willyield a stream of income into the future. I could, for example, buy 30-yearTreasury bonds. In March 1998 the $150,000 from my apartment sale would havebought bonds with a total yield of $8,925 a year. In March 1999 with $175,000 Ican buy such bonds with a yield of $9,730 a year. In those terms I have gotricher.            But Treasury bonds are not what make everyone feel richerevery day. I might want to be more venturesome in the hope of getting alarger--though riskier--income stream. Suppose I buy shares in the S&P 500Index. The price of that index rose 21.3 percent in the past year (to March11). Since the price of my apartment rose by only 16.6 percent, I can buy only96.1 percent as much of the S&P 500 as I could have bought a year ago. Butwhat I care about is how much future income I will get. If the future incomefrom the stocks in the S&P 500 has risen by 4 percent per share, I would begetting as much future income from buying in 1999 as I would have got frombuying in 1998. But I really don't know whether it has risen that much. So, Idon't know whether the shares of the S&P 500 I can buy for $175,000 inMarch 1999 are worth more than the shares I could have bought in March1998.            In March 1998 I couldhave bought 1,859 shares of Microsoft for the $150,000 price of my apartment.In March 1999 I can buy 1,084 shares. Am I richer or poorer in terms of theopportunity to earn income from Microsoft? Possibly the probable income fromthe 1,084 shares is greater than the probable income from the 1,859 shares was.But I don't know.            So am I richer than I was? The rise in the price tag of myapartment, combined with the changes in prices of other things, changes theopportunities I face. I have an opportunity to get more cash, more Product 19,and more annual income from Treasury bonds. In those terms I have becomericher. In terms of opportunity to enjoy living in my apartment, I am neitherricher nor poorer. I have become poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy theS&P 500 and even poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy Microsoft.Whether I have become richer or poorer in opportunity to earn income from theS&P 500 or from Microsoft I don't know, and neither does anyone else.            I suppose we do knowsomething about who has got richer or poorer relative to others in the past twoyears. The person who owned shares in Microsoft has got richer relative to theperson who owned the S&P 500, and that person has got richer relative tome, and I have got richer relative to the people who produced the stuff thatwent into the CPI, and they have got richer relative to the people who hadcash. I guess I am richer relative to the poor fellow who wants to earn thecost of my apartment by writing essays for $1 a word.            The wealth of the nation is its future stream of nationalincome. That stream is almost certainly a rising one. Year by year, and littleby little, we are as a nation--taking us all together--getting richer. But thathas little to do with, and is much less than, the surge in asset prices in thepast two years. Wealth is not wealth that alters when Greenspan speaks.            And yet, and yet, despite these uncertainties Ifeel richer when the price tag on the apartment I live in goes up. That may bean illusion, but illusions are facts of life.
