                                 Chattermailbox: FDR and Rock 'n' Roll            Walter S. Mossberg, who writes the "Personal Technology" column for the Wall Street Journal ,but whose true expertise lies in the field of music (when Chatterbox worked atthe Journal 's Washington bureau, he was the only person there who knewall the words to Woody Guthrie's "Union Maid"), takes exception to this column's assertion that baby boomers were not the first largemainstream audience to embrace rock 'n' roll (which previously, of course, hadbeen embraced by blacks). In an e-mail, Mossberg writes:                                             I agree that it's absurd to make some sharp delineation betweengenerations in the late 1950s and early '60s. Clearly there were boomers whodidn't get rock music, and some members of the prior generation of teens whodid get it. Early rock co-existed with pallid pop music. Nothing was asclear-cut about those days as it seems from today's perspective.                              But let me tell you why I think you may have been too dismissive when youwrote, "Were the consumers who turned 'Rock Around the Clock' and 'HeartbreakHotel' into hit records 9 and 10 years old? Of course they weren't. They wereteen-agers who'd been born during and shortly before World War II."               As a second-year boomer (March 1947, about six months younger than Clinton),I can testify that between the ages of 9 and 13 we were very musically adept inmy whitebread, spanking new suburban neighborhood in R.I. And we hadallowances, and we bought rock records. It was during those years in the late'50s, in fact, and not the '60s, that many of us older boomers were firstturned on to rock, began following the artists, and--defying parentalwishes--began listening clandestinely to the handful of DJs who played rock 'n'roll. And, believe me, if a city had one such DJ, that was a lot.               It was during the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades for me--not highschool--that I began to buy 45s and listen to people like Elvis, LittleRichard, and Duane Eddy. Now, we didn't go to any Bill Haley concerts, andolder teens, with more money and freedom, probably did play a big role in allof that. But there were significant differences between most people in thesetwo generations.               Unlike our predecessors, I knew of nobody in my group in the late '50s whohad ever listened to, or liked, people like Frank Sinatra or Perry Como. Thatwas our parents' music, we thought. The prior generation of teens thought folkmusic was the clean-cut Kingston Trio ; by the early '60s, we were into Peter, Paul andMary, and through them, Dylan. (When I marched on the Pentagon, PP&M weresinging away on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.) They tended to like PatBoone's covers of Little Richard. We liked the real thing.                              Remember that most early rock 'n' roll artists, including Haleyand--shockingly--Elvis, had repertoires that included lots of swing-type music,or syrupy ballads or "pop" tunes, which made them transitional artists able toappeal to both generations. Early rock was crossover music that allowed theolder teens to support it, until the transition stopped and it got too loud andunruly for many of them. By then, it was the '60s, and we boomers were theteens. So it all worked out.               A terrific account of all of this (though not of the demographics per se) isin the new book Flowers in the Dustbin                  , by James Miller. He doesa great job chronicling the early proto-rock, among other things.                                       Chatterbox is intrigued, but not surprised, to learn that his friendMossberg was a-rockin' and a-rollin' from the age of 9. Indeed, Chatterboxfinds it impossible to picture the 9-year-old Mossberg as anything other than aprecocious know-it-all. The question is, how many other9-year-olds--exempting the other kids in Mossberg's whitebread suburbanneighborhood, who no doubt fell under his influence--were buying rock 'n' rollrecords? Surely not many. But Chatterbox concedes he may be wrong about this,and invites others in Mossberg's age cohort (52, 53) to submit testimonials onthis question to the Fray (to do so, click below).
