                                 The Poverty of Electoral Politics                        A difference between you and me that transcends right vs. left is that youtake electoral politics more seriously than I. Democrats vs. Republicans is apolitics of small differences at this point. The country is basically being runby global corporations that, aside from their direct economic influence on whogets elected and what they do when they get elected (a large aside), controleconomic policy by essentially saying to politicians on all levels, federal,state, and local, give us fiscal austerity, low taxes, and less regulation orwe a) will take our jobs elsewhere and b) won't lend you money. In general Iprefer Democrats because they're not beholden to the Christian right and theanti-abortion movement, they're less likely to make totally Neanderthal courtappointments, etc. But even on social issues, there's more convergence thannot. Clinton is one of the more anti-civil-libertarian presidents in modernhistory. Both parties support the drug war and its attendant police-stateapparatus--no-knock raids, forfeiture of property of people who haven't beenconvicted of anything, Draconian sentences, peeing on command as a requirementfor getting or holding jobs, etc.--the latest thing is they want to inflict onFlorida a genetically engineered fungus that's supposed to kill marijuanaplants, although no one can guarantee it won't be an ecological disaster; thesepeople are crazy! Both parties want to censor the media. The don't-ask,don't-tell approach to gays in the military has only encouraged sexual witchhunts. Then there's welfare reform, whose two basic assumptions are thatendless work at wages too meager to live on is morally uplifting and thatsingle mothers are causing all of society's problems.            The bottom line (probably not my best metaphor in this context) is thesuccess of the corporate elite and free-market ideologues in pushing the "endof history" idea--that in a post-Communist world there is no alternative to ourpresent economic and social system, like it or not. This is a colossal failureof imagination. It's true enough that it's very difficult right now to envisionwhat that alternative might be. I certainly have no blueprints to offer. Butthere have always been people who argued that change is impossible, orunnecessary, or both, and they have always been wrong.            It seems to me that this idea that what is simply is , period, isparalyzing on a cultural as well as a political level. I didn't mean to implythat there is really a "counterculture" now, in the sense of any consciouscollective opposition. You're right, there's nothing comparable to the culturalradicalism of the '60s and '70s. And certainly not much interest in politics--Ithink most people these days see politics as pretty trivial and irrelevant totheir lives. What I see in, among other things, techno, is a counterculturalimpulse--an implicit desire for something different. (Am I sounding too muchlike Greil again?) Mostly, I don't see that young people have any sense thatthings can be different, so the desire stays under the surface. I thinkschool massacres and teen-age girls killing their infants are ultimately aboutdespair and fatalism. Keeping kids out of R-rated movies is not going to help.What did you think about the Columbine shooting and the public reaction? I'd beinterested in your take.            OK, onto somewhat less grim terrain. Magazines. You have to understand thatmy standards for a really good magazine are still New York andEsquire in the '60s and Rolling Stone in the '70s. This is arecipe for total frustration on the contemporary magazine front. Never mind"favorite." What are the magazines I look forward to reading? First, I guess,would be Commentary , believe it or not--especially the letters section.Then Atlantic --I like to read the cover essays. I like LinguaFranca , but for whatever reason I let my subscription lapse. So I guess itcomes down to the Nation , which provides much of my material for all myarguments with the mainstream left.
