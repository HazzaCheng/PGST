                                 Passing on the Left                        Dear Tamar,            Bill Bradley was known as "Dollar Bill" when he played professionalbasketball--not because of how he played but because he squeezed his dollarsuntil they wept and cried. While his teammate Walt Frazier ran around in minkcoats and Rolls Royces, Dollar Bill wore the same ratty trench coat and shoesrun down at the heels. Just something I thought you'd like to know. We are backagain at tactics. The Bradley inside crew has looked at what seems like a lockby Al Gore and decided to run to Gore's left. The Gorites have seen this andare protecting that flank--but not too flagrantly. They showed this recentlywith the Gore proposal to achieve health insurance for more of America'schildren. Not all "tactics" are evil. This a worthy goal, one that will save usall those emergency-room dollars--but it is part of a political maneuver aswell. Bradley has rightly sensed discontent among traditional Dems aboutClinton's me-tooism with respect to Republican philosophy. The problem is thatthe discontent was eclipsed by public anger about the impeachment drama.            The brilliance of the conservative movement (take a bow, you craftyKristols) lies principally in how it changed the language of Americanpolitics. "Liberal" became a pejorative, synonymous with weakness, taxation,overspending--and blind obeisance to welfare cheats and Negroes. Liberals werenonplused and bit their nails as the conservative ideology machine turned theminto pulp. That machine would still be dominating the debate--had it not beenfor Newt and the radicals who overplayed the mandate and made the Americanpeople edgy. Dollar Bill, Rhodes Scholar that he is, is smart enough to knowall this and is betting that there will be some daylight to the left of Gore.George W. is in the same ball park. He saw that frothing Republican conventionin '92 that spelled disaster for his party. He will not be out-compassioned andwill utter sweet nothings even as he pulls the switch on the electric chair.Both Dollar Bill and George W. recognize that Americans are a people of themiddle . But as for Dollar Bill, he's caught in the passing lane behind theGore express. As that girl group used to say in the famous doo-wop song:It's gonna take a miracle, yes, it's gonna take a miracle."                        Speaking of loaded terminology. The big conservative coup was transformingthe phrase "affirmative action" into "preferences"--as you do in yourposting--such that newspapers use the two interchangeably. I refer you to theChicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page--just about the only prime-timejournalist in the country to really jump on this, this ... linguistichijacking. The two terms are not interchangeable. "Affirmative action"connotes reaching out to underrepresented minorities on the grounds that someracial mixture is socially desirable. When I go out to find and hire people Ido not "prefer" someone nonwhite. But I do in fact "prefer" to have a staffthat reflects something of the population that my business is meant toserve--lest my company falter and die. Hence, the New York City cops searchingfor gay police officers. Wise move, in this capital of Wigstock, that Labor Daydrag ball.            On the question of how we salvage inner-city schools. We as a people must bewilling to ensure at the minimum that the kids have a qualified teacher at thefront of the room, a set of books, and a safe school. When the schools areparticularly bad--as in the case of Washington, D.C., I have advocatedvouchers, not penny ante ones proposed by some in Congress last year but realones that would send at least a few kids out of the city to the very bestschools available. We can't do anything about bad parents--be they white badparents or black bad parents--and simply must treat that issue as such. If ittakes federal subsidies or a Peace Corps strategy, so be it. The ACLU suit inCalifornia may be slow going, but it has highlighted the principle problem. Asa culture, we have tended to believe that good education is wasted on the blackand brown poor--who will soon be the majority. And as Ward Connerly said theother day, that sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy that is killing thekids--and America's future in the bargain. We can either throw up our hands--orsend in the troops. It's that simple, I think.
