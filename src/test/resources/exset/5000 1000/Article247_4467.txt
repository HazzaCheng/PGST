                                 More Un-Bubblish Behavior From the Market                        This is a strange time in the stock market. On the one hand, prevailingwisdom among the chattering classes has it that current stock prices,especially on the Nasdaq, represent a bubble, and that the best we can hope foris for that bubble to lose slow air slowly, rather than in one giant burst. Istarted collecting examples of journalists saying things like "this overvaluedmarket" and "Does anyone remember Japan in the 1980s?," but I stopped because,well, I got bored. At the same time, though, no one seems to be actuallyselling their stock, perhaps because everyone's succumbed to the siren song oflong-term investing or perhaps because everyone always thinks they'll be theones who can get out just before the crash.                           Or it may be that people are staying invested because for a supposed bubblein which prices are driven ever higher by indiscriminate investors, this marketis actually quite discriminating, and its standards for corporate performanceremain quite high. In an earliercolumn, I wrote about the segmentation of Internet stocks into winners andlosers, and in recent weeks we've seen a mediocre Christmas further segment theNet sector by taking a real toll on Internet retailers. When Lucent recentlyannounced that its quarterly numbers would fall well short of expectations, thestock dropped 40 percent. And today, Qualcomm saw its stock price drop 10percent in a few minutes of after-hours trading despite the fact that thecompany announced that it had grown profits by 213 percent in the latestquarter.               Now, one way of looking at these sharp turns in market sentiment is todismiss them by citing them as evidence of that much-dreaded "volatility." Buta more accurate way of looking at them is to see that investors are thinkinghard about what news means for a company's future earning prospects and are notinterested in rewarding companies that fail to live up to expectations. (Forfurther evidence of this, look at the market's reaction to all the recentmerger announcements.) It's also the case that those expectations are veryhigh, as the case of Qualcomm suggests.               Of course, the market's expectations should be very high, what with theprices investors are paying. Qualcomm's profits grew by 213 percent, but itsstock is up more than 1,400 percent in the past year, so it may have a ways togo (down, that is) before it's fairly valued. And Lucent's quarterly numberswere more worthy of a slow-growing consumer-products company than of ahigh-priced tech giant, so the market's reaction was hardly surprising. Butwhat's interesting is that it isn't just stocks trading at stratospheric levelsthat are punished, nor is it just stocks that fall well short ofexpectations.               Take, for instance, SBC Communications, the largest Baby Bell, whichannounced earnings today right in line with analysts' estimates. SBC's profitand revenue growth weren't staggering, but they weren't disappointing, either.The company showed strong growth in its wireless business, which remains one ofthe hottest sectors around, and it issued a bullish forecast for the comingyear. But Project Pronto, SBC's $6 billion effort to roll out DSL Internetaccess to its local customers, fell well short of expectations. Sincehigh-speed Internet access will soon be a crucial, perhaps the crucial,business for local phone companies to dominate, this was not good news. On aday when the market rebounded sharply in the afternoon, SBC finished the daydown 10 percent. And this was not after a big run-up. On the contrary, thestock had already been down 28 percent over the last 12 months.                        The market's judgment was, I think, the right one. (Actually, SBC's stockdeserves to drop just on the basis of naming the DSL initiative "ProjectPronto," but that's neither here nor there.) But the important point is thatthe judgment was made. In a pure speculative market, like the South Sea Bubble,it was enough to exist to coin money. And even in the months leading up to theCrash of 1929, or during the rapid rise of the Nikkei in the 1980s, corporateperformance seemed to matter less and less. Say what you will about thismarket. There are no byes for the teams that are playing in it.
