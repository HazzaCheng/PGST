                                 Fowler Deeds            The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times lead with local political stories but their nationalleads concern the testimony before the Thompson committee of the most prominentDNC official to appear thus far. USA Today leads with the shocking fine print in aforeign relations bill. The Washington Post goes with the latest dustup between NATOpeacekeeping forces and Bosnian Serbs.            The big news at the fundraising hearings, says the NYT , is theadmission by witness Donald Fowler, the Democratic Party chairman during the1996 election, that on several occasions, he intervened with Clintonadministration officials on behalf of large party donors. Perhaps the mostquestionable piece of networking is one that Fowler testified he couldn'trecall, but which documents revealed for the first time yesterday stronglyconfirm: namely, contacting the CIA at the behest of Roger Tamraz, aninternational financier "with a questionable reputation" (says theTimes ) who was angling for Clinton administration support for a proposedCaspian region oil pipeline, and who had given the Democrats $300,000.            The NYT says such interventions are probably not illegal, but againstDNC guidelines, which state: "In no event should any DNC staff ever promise ameeting with or access to any government official or agency in connection witha donation, or ever imply that such contact or access can be arranged, or evercontact an administration official on behalf of a donor for any reason." Whenthis rule was quoted to Fowler yesterday by Republican Sen. Susan Collins, hisresponse was: "I am not a staff member of the Democratic National Committee. Iwas a chair of the Democratic National Committee, and there is a cleardifference there." The LAT in its Fowler story emphasizes a part of histestimony that the NYT mentions only in passing: that the fund-raisingscandal was really more the responsibility of then-presidential adviser HaroldM. Ickes who, Fowler said, often countermanded his advice.            Both of the Times run strong companion pieces to their hearingcoverage. The NYT weighs in with the news that during the last electioncycle, the DNC took at least $2 million in contributions restricted to genericuse by the party that, in violation of election laws, it then spent directly onPresident Clinton's re-election campaign. And the LAT delves intoanother aspect of Tamraz's activities: his secret talks with top aides of--talkabout covering your political bases--Boris Yeltsin to discuss donating $100million to Yeltsin's presidential campaign in return for his support for theCaspian oil project.            In covering President Clinton's goal of getting "fast-track" authority inorder to enter into free-trade agreements with more countries, the Wall Street Journal notes, in a lions-den reportingstrategy, that even in the Missouri congressional district ofarch-protectionist Dick Gephardt it is obvious that, post-Nafta, firms arecreating jobs and increasing pay due to increased export sales. In fact, theJournal accompanies the piece with a chart showing that only threestates--Oklahoma, Washington, and Alaska--are exporting fewer goods sinceNAFTA.                           USAT flyspecks the latest revision in the Foreign RelationsAuthorization Act, engineered by Jesse Helms, which putscorporations--including at least seven big tobacco companies--at the head ofthe line of claimants to $1.3 billion in Iraqi funds frozen in U.S. banks, andputs Pacific Gulf war veterans, many of whom are suffering the effects of Iraqichemical munitions, at the end of it.            Incidentally, it's nice to see that USAT isn't afraid to express anopinion within a news story--generally a no-no at the other majors. Note thescare-quotes in the following: "The only veterans covered...would be injuredsurvivors of Iraq's 1987 missile attack upon the frigate USS Stark .Families of the 37 sailors who died in that 'accidental' incident already hadbeen given $27.3 million in compensation by Iraq before the gulf war."
