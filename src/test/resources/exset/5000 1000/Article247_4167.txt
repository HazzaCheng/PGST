                                 Toon-Town                        It's fitting that the decade ends with the best year for movies of thedecade, 1999. (And, thank God, nobody got around to slipping Prince's "1999"into a movie. Not even End of Days , which was so low that such a clichwould've looked like a classy move.) This year, there are three animated moviesalone that deserve to be on a top-10 list-- South Park , The IronGiant , and Toy Story 2 . (And one other, Princess Mononoke ,that has moments of epic grandeur and images so primal they could be liftedfrom a nightmare, or cause one.) Even the first 20 minutes or so ofTarzan , before Phil Collins started to resurrect songs that weren't goodenough for Michelob commercials, were impressive.                           South Park is so good that the apparent problem, bringing the show'slimited stylization to the big screen--it's like animation by Colorforms(which, I know, is the point)--was immediately solved. Some of its sequencesbounce around in your head forever. Satan's big number, a malicious piece ofparody that's one of the funniest movie moments of the year, is a power balladfor a Broadway crowd--imagine an Andrew Lloyd Webber number written for MeatLoaf or, worse, Michael Bolton. South Park is a reminder of the greatmoments from the old Henry Beard/Doug Kenny National Lampoon , where theaudacity and smarts still leave you tearing up helplessly when you try toexplain what you love about the work months later. And your friends roll theireyes at your lack of descriptive skills.            The last few years have been a struggle to put together a 10-best list, sowhen three cartoons make enough of an impact to each deserve a slot, you knowthings are looking up. Toy Story 2 , like South Park , is thickwith small jokes bordering the bigger jokes. It seems perfect for that genrethat flowered in the '90s, the movie made for repeated home viewing so you canstudy it frame by frame, like the Zapruder film. (Or the president's surlyvideo apology, where you try to analyze the squint as he says, "I did not havesex with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky.") The end of the picture, a breatherwhere Woody and Buzz take a moment to go over what has happened to them, feelslike the end of a John Ford movie, and has a wonderful ease.            I saw Giant in the sub-basement of one of those I-don't-wanna-be-heremultiplexes, and watched the place light up with happy chatter from kids andparents, each group trying to explain their version of the movie to the other.Giant helped Warner Bros., which started the year so out of touch Ithought it was stuck in the triangle section of the Jurassic Park Orchestra,bounce back. Three Kings and The Matrix , two of the year's mostpropulsive pictures, were also part of the revivified Warner slate. Both movieshave brains and velocity. Three Kings feels like it was fired from agun, and The Matrix generates so much excitement that it's like beingcaught in the crosshairs of one.            The only disappointment is that Warner wasn't able to sell Kings andGiant to mainstream audiences. In the end, it probably does take anoutfit like Disney to put out animation. (Warner did release Pokmon ,though taking credit for its success is, to use an old Lorne Michaels line,like standing next to someone who got shot and getting a Purple Heart anyway.)Though a bigger disappointment is that they were able to put Wild, WildWest over, which is a bigger insult than the lazy samples Will Smith hasturned into a pop career. (You can almost hear him going through his parents'collection of vinyl from the Columbia Record Club.) Three Kings uses themechanism of the action picture for its visceral power, and to make a pointabout the callousness of action movies, a programmer with a bit of The ThirdMan slipped in to make a point. It's gotta be a great year for movies whenone of the stars of Three Kings , Spike Jonze, who gives one of the bestsupporting performances of the year, also directs one of the best pictures:Being John Malkovich . It's all about riches just for domesticmovies.
