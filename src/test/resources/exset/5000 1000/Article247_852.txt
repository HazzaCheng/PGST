                                 Barnes and Ignoble            The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times lead with the Senate's commencement of closed-doorimpeachment deliberations. USA Today reefers the Senate doings (to a storyrunning on page 11) and goes instead with the report on the Salt Lake CityOlympics bid turned in by an independent ethics panel, which found more than $1million in funny money and implicated as many as 10 International Olympicmembers (in addition to the 14 already fingered). The paper reports asignificant reaction to the muck raked thus far: John Hancock Insurance hasdropped plans for placing $20 million in Olympic ads with NBC. The Olympicsreport gets prominent front play at the other majors. The Washington Post leads with the deterioration of Russia'searly warning defense against nuclear missile attack, which the paper says, hasgotten to the point that for several hours each day, Russian militarycommanders cannot see any of the thousands of land- and sub-based missilesaimed at them. The upshot is a much increased risk that the Russians would makea "serious miscalculation." That's tech-speak for "accidentally blow the worldup." The paper follows up inside with a fascinating interview with the formerRussian officer who decided on a hunch that an apparent Sept. 1983 AmericanICBM attack was a false alarm and so didn't start World War III.            The NYT , citing unnamed senators as sources, says that in closedsession (the result of a sunshine motion missing the required two-thirds byeight votes), senators spoke one at a time for or against the two impeachmentarticles. The mood, says the NYT , was somber and without partisansniping, but the speeches were almost all along party lines. The LATlead quotes one senator saying that each of his colleagues to speak thus farhas used up his full fifteen minutes. The NYT explains its access tosenators' versions of the day by stating that although Senate rules forbid thelawmakers from divulging what occurs in closed session, senators had voted inopen session to allow each other to essentially reiterate what they said behindclosed doors.            While it's flatly assumed that President Clinton will not be removed fromoffice, the LAT suggests that a few senators in each party will castcrossover votes. The paper also sees the idea of censuring President Clintonlosing momentum.                           USAT and the WP front a federal appealscourt ruling, almost surely headed for the Supreme Court, holding that forthe five states covered by the court--Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, NorthCarolina and South Carolina--a criminal suspect's confession could be held tobe voluntary and admissible even if he was not read his Miranda rights.            The WP fronts the surprising results of the first study to cover thefull range of sexual problems since the Kinsey reports 50years ago: Four out of ten women and nearly one-third of men suffer from sexualdysfunction. The authors of the study, which appears today in JAMA, say this is"a significant public health concern." There is at least one hopeful findingthough: college educated women are more than twice as likely not to suffer fromlack of sexual desire as those who did not complete high school, and men whocomplete college also tend to complete something else, suffering much lesspremature ejaculation than male high school dropouts. Today's Papers thinksthis data could be the basis of the best stay-in-school ad campaign of alltime.            The NYT reports inside on what amounts to a quick reward for itsstory earlier in the week exposing Amazon.com's covert pay-for-play book reviewscheme: a complete climb-down by the company. Henceforth, reports theTimes , the company promises to disclose when publishers pay it tofeature specific books. One question, though. Today's Papers notices that thebook review portion of the NYT online site leads to the Barnes and Nobleweb site. Doesn't the Times receive money from Barnes and Noble forthis? And if so, isn't this arrangement similar enough to the one at Amazon tohave warranted mention? And isn't this especially important since Barnes andNoble is an Amazon.com competitor?            The WP runs an AP dispatch inside reporting that voter turnout inlast November's elections--36.06 percent--was the nation's lowest in 56 years.Highly partisan, negative campaigns seem to be implicated. But on the otherhand, in an item elsewhere in the Post , a representative of the AmericanApparel Manufacturers Association cites the Lewinsky scandal for a positivetrend: the third quarter's 11 percent hike in lingerie sales.
