                                 Back to Basic                           USAToday leads with the news that a special civilian commission appointedby the DOD will release a report today reversing more than a decade of Pentagongender-integration policies by concluding that men and women should go throughbasic training separately. The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times lead with the DOD's announcement that all U.S. militaryforces (active and reserve) will be inoculated against the deadly biologicalwarfare agent anthrax. The lead national story at the Washington Post is President Clinton's appointment of BillLann Lee to the Justice Department's top civil rights job.            That DOD panel, says USAT , found that the military's present co-edtraining approach "is resulting in less discipline, less unit cohesion and moredistraction." The Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, can, says the paper,implement the panel's recommendations without congressional approval. (Thestory is also on the NYT front.)            The NYT lead reports that the Pentagon anthrax inoculationprogram will consist of a series of six shots to start with and then annualboosters. It will, says the Times , begin next summer with the 100,000troops in the Persian Gulf and in Korea. (Soldiers in the Gulf for Desert Stormreceived the initial dosage only.) Completion of the program will take sixyears and cost $130 million. The LAT also leads with thisstory, and it's the second lead at USAT . The WP has the storytoo--on p. 23.            The anthrax stories all mention the official Pentagon explanation that suchcountries as Iraq, Iran, and Libya have stockpiled anthrax weapons and that thetoxin is considered a rising terrorist threat. Yet none of them breathe a wordabout the idea of inoculating the civilian population as well.            Was Bill Clinton's interim (that is, with Congress adjourned) appointment ofLee as acting DOJ civil rights boss a snub of the Senate, (which turned Leedown)? That's a little hard to tell from the headlines. The WP runs"President Bypasses Congress, Appoints Lee On Acting Basis," while theNYT goes with "Clinton, Softening Slap At Senate, Names 'Acting' CivilRights Chief." The LAT runs "Clinton Defies GOP, Names Lee RightsChief."            In reporting on a FBI sting that collared 16 computer brokers trafficking instolen IBM parts across five states, the Wall Street Journal reports that the theft of computerhardware and software is hitting $8 billion annually.            The NYT reports that the December issue of "Suicide andLife-Threatening Behavior" (bitchin' swimsuit issue!) includes a studypurporting to show that in the major gambling cities of the U.S.--AtlanticCity, Las Vegas, and Reno--the suicide rates are up to four times higher thanin comparably sized cities where gambling is not legal.            In case you're distracted this week by deep worries about who the leadcharacters in "Love Story" were based on, relax, the NYT is on the case.Last week's Time reported that after a long day on the road, Al Goresidled up to some reporters traveling with him on his plane and in the courseof the conversation allowed as to how in college, he was friends with novelistErich Segal, and in fact he and Tipper were the models for the doomed lovers inSegal's "Love Story." Last Sunday's NYT reported that Segal denies this(and denied it to Gore in a phone call). The author claims that he got somecharacter traits for the male lead from Gore, but others from Gore's roommate(and eventual movie star) Tommy Lee Jones, and nothing at all for the femalelead from Tipper. Gore responded by saying he was misquoted, and a Gorespokesperson said the conversation was off the record anyway (which reporterswho were there deny). Today, FrankRich's op-ed column tells us what this all means: that "disingenuousness,not stiffness, is [Gore's] real character problem." Stay tuned for moreTimes coverage--Maureen Dowd has reportedly also been investigating. Ormaybe she's pursuing something else, like the rumor that when Arthur C. Clarkewas writing 2001 he used Gore as the model for HAL.
