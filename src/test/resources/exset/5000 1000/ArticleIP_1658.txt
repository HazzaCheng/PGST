                                 Telling the Hearings to Shut Up            Wall Street came in third,surprisingly, on the weekend talk shows, which dwelt primarily on Campaigngateand China--the same topics they chewed over last week. Why? Oh, partly becausethe stock market was a Monday-Tuesday story--a mountain that, from theforeshortened perspective of TV producers, loomed smaller at week's end thannearby hills; and partly because the Washington commentariat will always preferpolitical stories to financial ones (perhaps sensing that their views on thelatter are especially baseless). Also, TV producers--even of talk shows--preferstories with good visuals (such as Jiang Zemin in a colonial hat). How oftencan you play tape of that damned bell at the New York Stock Exchange?            Congressional hearings delight the commentariat as a reliable source of grist,and the pundits did not care for Sen. Fred Thompson's announcement that hiscampaign-finance investigation is closing shop. Both conservative Brit Hume( Fox News Sunday ) and liberal Clarence Page (ABC's This Week )berated Thompson for failing to put a better "focus" on the hearings. Thompsonhimself insisted on CNN's Late Edition that his hearings had revealed a"pattern of illegal foreign money" as well as "money laundering." But Humedelivered the consensus line that Thompson had doomed the hearings from theget-go with his overly ambitious opening argument that the Chinese governmenthad engaged in a "broad-based conspiracy" to buy the 1996 presidentialelection.            Democrats like Sen. Tom Daschle, appearing on NBC's Meetthe Press , found the hearings insufficiently bipartisan. NewsHour WithJim Lehrer 's Paul Gigot said Republicans had shuttered the hearings becauseThompson was "too bipartisan." Having portrayed Thompson as a politicalincompetent, the pundits weren't completely ungrateful. They lauded him forpresenting a "picture" of (Gloria Borger on Face the Nation ) and a"window" on (Tom Oliphant on NewsHour and Juan Williams on Fox NewsSunday ) standard-issue Washington corruption. It's a "government for rent,if not for sale," said Borger.            Bowing toCongress' prerogative to shape the news, the shows feigned interest in Sen.Trent Lott's public promise--reprised in person on Meet the Press-- toallow a vote on new campaign-finance legislation in March. By contrast, genuineenthusiasm greeted the unfolding Bruce Babbitt story, as Gigot and BobSchieffer (CBS's Face the Nation ) both predicted that Babbitt's SupremeCourt ambitions would be ruined by accusations that he had blocked a casinolicense for an Indian tribe at the behest of another tribe that had given moneyto the Democrats.            The consensus on Jiang's state visit was thatit was a "win-win," in the words of Eleanor Clift of The McLaughlinGroup . Al Hunt (CNN's Capital Gang ) declared that "Clinton got itright" by simultaneously criticizing China's human-rights violations andtoasting the dictator. Clinton's centrist approach produced a "domesticconsumption summit" for both leaders, said The McLaughlin Group ie MortonKondracke, and the talk-show chorus agreed that Jiang benefited from the summitbecause he emerged a co-equal of Clinton's and didn't really give up anything.Likewise, Clinton benefited because he engaged Jiang and didn't really give upanything. Pat Buchanan ( The McLaughlin Group ) and George Will ( ThisWeek ) were lonely dissenters, taking the view that warm relations with ahideous human-rights violator are not especially praiseworthy. But the NewYork Times ' Thomas Friedman expressed the pundits' consensus onFace : The business of American foreign policy is business, and "[w]henit comes to business, we engage."            Alan Greenspan's blessing ofthe Monday crash attracted only buyers. Everybody urged investors to buy stocksfor the long term. The United States remains "the envy of the Japanese andEuropeans," said Hunt.                           Emerging: Ross Perotgave identical performances on Meet the Press and Late Edition ,sounding off about his usual themes. He did introduce one new subject: theimpending rewrite of the patent laws that (he says) will allow foreigners tosteal U.S. inventions. The topic went nowhere because his hosts had no ideawhat he was talking about. On This Week , George Will, Sam Donaldson, andCokie Roberts all but cheered when Bill Richardson drew a line in the sand overSaddam Hussein's ouster of three U.S. weapons inspectors in Iraq. Donaldsonseemed ready to suit up for Gulf War II as he enthusiastically summarizedRichardson's position. "There is no negotiation, Saddam Hussein is innon-compliance, and he must comply."                           --JackShafer
