                                 Blinkmanship            Saturday, an hour beforeU.S. planes and missiles were scheduled to attack Iraq, Saddam Husseinapparently surrendered. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,Saddam announced that Iraq would allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume theirwork in Iraq, which Saddam had previously halted. With that, President Clintondecided that the purpose of the U.S. attack--to punish Saddam's refusal tocooperate with the inspectors--had been rendered moot. So Clinton called offthe attack.            Punditsspent the next two days questioning Clinton's judgment and manhood. Theyaccused him of "flinching" and letting Saddam start and stop confrontations asthough the United States were "on a yo-yo." "Does anyone seriously believe thatIraq backed down and not the United States?" asked Bill Kristol on ABC'sThis Week . "It was a chance finally to take decisive action, and thepresident blinked." On CNN's Late Edition , Susan Page said Clinton washaving trouble explaining "why it isn't the United States who blinked." "Whichone blinked?" asked the front-page headline in Monday's New York Times ."Diddled again," answered the headline over William Safire's column. "It didn'ttake much for Saddam Hussein to get the attack called off, did it?" scoffedBrit Hume on Fox News Sunday . "We're letting Saddam Hussein drive ourpolicy."            This criticism has two parts: "blink" and "yo-yo." Theblink critique assumes that the purpose of preparing the attack was to completeit and thereby hurt Iraq. But suppose Clinton's deeper purpose is--as hesays--to control and eliminate Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. Andsuppose he believes--as he says he does--that the best way to do this isthrough the weapons inspections, not through a military assault. In that case,once Saddam agreed to let the inspections resume, the truly resolute course wasto accept the offer and call off the attack.            The yo-yocritique focuses on predictability. First Clinton authorized the attack becauseSaddam had halted the weapons inspections. Then, when Saddam allowed theinspections to resume, Clinton called off the attack. The yo-yo charge impliesthat Clinton is letting Saddam manipulate him. What this metaphor nicelyobscures is the rationality behind Clinton's predictability. Yo-yos and otherobjects follow laws of nature. Humans follow laws of our own making. We've eveninvented a name for these laws: "principles." Clinton's principle is that theinspections must resume. When Saddam violates that principle, Clinton willattack. When Saddam yields to the same principle, Clinton will not attack. Yes,Saddam can choose the outcome, just as you can choose your fate by deciding howto answer a mugger who says, "Your money or your life." But do you reallyimagine that you're the one in control?            This is what Clinton tried to explain at hispress conference on Sunday, "Our willingness to strike ... produced the outcomewe preferred: Saddam Hussein reversing course, letting the inspectors go backto work without restrictions or conditions." The press wasn't buying it. "Whatdo you say to the criticism that Saddam Hussein is jerking the United Statesaround, that he is able to provoke a crisis and then end it on his timetable?"one reporter asked National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. "Don't you think inthe Arab world they're going to look at it and say, 'OK, Saddam won again?' "asked another. Berger could only reply in exasperation that Saddam had"capitulated" on the key issue of weapons inspections. "We have to be able totake yes for an answer," he pleaded.            Thepundits, captive to the geopolitics of machismo, think saying yes is easy. Butwhen everyone wants you to say no, saying yes is hard. Yo-yos can't do it.Neither can cruise missiles. That's why we have presidents.                           Recent"Frame Games"                        "Cannibalism": TheHouse coup is taking the GOP in the wrong direction.
