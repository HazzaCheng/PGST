                                 Car Wreck            The LAT and NYT lead with the gathering GOP momentum for impeachment and theWhite House's response to it. USAT runs that story as its off-lead, goinginstead with President Clinton's visit to the Gaza Strip, which also gets thebiggest print at the WP.            The main thrust of the two Times leads is that the ranks of theRepublican members of Congress declaring themselves to be firmly againstimpeachment is shrinking. This despite fresh NYT polling indicating that64 percent of Americans do not want their representatives to vote forimpeachment. The poll in today's WP offers a slightly different pictureof the electorate: yes, six in 10 Americans are against impeachment, but if theHouse votes to impeach, 58 percent of them say Clinton should then resign. TheLAT runs a front-pager about its new poll likewise showing that a clearmajority of Americans oppose impeachment. The paper's lead editorial proclaimsthat "A Congress so out of step with the people it claims to represent ...is agreater danger to the Republic than all of Clinton's selfish lies."            Both Times find the wavering of Republican Rep. Christopher Shaysparticularly important, noting that Shays had long been an announced foe ofimpeachment. Both report that Shays will soon have a personal meeting withClinton to discuss the matter. The LAT passes along a Beltway rumoraccording to which Congress' lone Socialist, Bernard Sanders, was also changingto a pro impeachment vote. The NYT says Rep. Mark Souder, another earlyopponent of impeachment, is still solid, but the LAT says he'sreconsidering his position. The paper sums up the situation as trending againstClinton, with the White House appearing to be at a loss about what to do. TheNYT says: "Republicans appeared to be moving steadily towardimpeachment."            Everybody notes that the congressional hearts-and-minds battle seems to haveshifted away from official White House channels: to People for the American Wayradio spots, AFL-CIO-organized phone campaigns, and a Jesse Jackson-led prayervigil.            The WP and USAT both report that Clinton's visit to the GazaStrip--the first ever by an American president--gives a powerful boost to hopesof eventual Palestinian statehood. And both report that Clinton watched asPalestinian representatives raised hands to overwhelmingly revoke theanti-Israel parts of their charter. The WP version emphasizes the uptickfor the Palestinians, while the USAT take dwells more on unanticipatedobstacles to the peace process: like Israel's decision not to go through with aplanned troop withdrawal this Friday, because of recent violent protests inGaza.            The NYT front continues to peck at the Clinton/China connection witha piece claiming that federal investigators have come across new evidence aboutChina's 1996 political contributions. These contributions, were not, as wasoriginally thought, designed to influence the outcomes of particular races suchas Clinton's, but, says the paper, were part of a broad campaign to acquireAmerican high technology. Giving the money, investigators now think, was, inthe spirit of the American corporate lobbying model, designed to enhance thecontributors' political access so that they could more effectively argue forChina-friendly trade and technology policies. The paper notes that onefund-raiser in this effort, Johnny Chung, now cooperating with federalofficials, pleaded guilty yesterday and was sentenced to five years' probation.As if supporting the Times ' contention, the sentencing judge expresseddoubt about Democratic officials assertions of ignorance concerningfund-raising abuses and said he was surprised that Janet Reno had not appointeda special prosecutor to investigate further.            The WSJ reports in a front-page feature that the government has a dress codefor auto crash test dummies. They are supposed to wear matching cotton shirtsand shorts and black-leather oxford shoes. This is so engineers can clearly seehow the limbs flail in a crash. Why the shoes? Because that's what people incrashes are usually wearing. However, socks are optional.
