We take it not as funny but as something very serious." Whosaid this about what?                                       "Rudolph Giuliani, on his administration.

Randy'sWrap-Up                        Once, when you were madethe butt of a joke, a recurring punch line on Johnny, it really was serious:You were finished as a public figure. (See Dan Quayle.) More recently, when youbecome a running gag on Dave or Jay, you're merely humanized. (See Dan Quayle.)Perhaps that's as it should be. Mockability is an evanescent quality; it's theslip-up, the gaffe, the anomalous pratfall.

Or as aformer editor of Harper's once said, it's not what's illegal that's thecrime; it's what's legal.

On Monday, Dunkin' Donutsfiled suit against the Riese Organization, the owner of that Manhattanstore.
