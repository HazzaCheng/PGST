                                 Searching for Roots We Never Had            In the summer, people cometo New England--Vermont, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Maine--for the naturalamenities, the water, the mountains, the clear, fresh, cool air, the blueskies. But they also come, I think, in search of their roots. They want notonly to find but also to identify with the America of 200 years ago. They wantto sit on the porch of the local country store and drink coffee and eatblueberry muffins. They want to browse through the flea market searching forsome memento that connects with, let us say, 1830. If they are near the seathey want to eat lobsters by the peck. Some of the men will grow little beards,to be shaved off after Labor Day.            Some ofthe summer people have been coming to the same small town for so many years,even for more than one generation, that they are part of the local scene and dohave roots there. I am thinking of the more occasional visitors. Very few haveroots in small-town New England. Some may have Boston roots. More have New Yorkand New Jersey roots. And most have roots two or three generations back inLithuania or Ireland or Sicily. But they like to think of themselves as havinga family connection with early America.            These small New England towns are part of the origins ofthe political, economic, and social world we all live in. But so arePhiladelphia and Charlottesville, Va. The summer people coming to these smalltowns are not tourists looking for a civics lesson. They are, it seems to me,seeking and imagining a more personal, familial connection. That is what I meanby "roots."            I don'tderide this at all. On the contrary, I think it is wonderful that people hereshould become so Americanized, so naturalized, that they come to admire andseek to identify with a history in which their families had no part. It is atestament to openness and democracy in America that so many of us want thisconnection and succeed in achieving it. I don't know this, but I doubt thatthis absorption occurs elsewhere in the world. Would a person whose family hadlived in France or Japan for three generations come to identify himself withthe French or the Japanese culture of 200 years ago as if his family had been apart of it? I don't think so, unless the person was exceptionally rich ordistinguished and so transcended national boundaries.            The search for roots is a common phenomenon.People want to see where they came from in order to understand and appreciatethemselves better. The Irish like to go back to the Old Sod and see theconditions in which their grandparents lived and perhaps meet relatives theyhad not known before. The same seems to be true of Italians and probablyothers. But the New England phenomenon is the adoption of roots that are notreally there.            Why dopeople seek ersatz roots to identify with? Perhaps because the world changes sorapidly that for many people, the real roots no longer exist. Once on a trip toDetroit, where I was born, I tried to visit the scenes of my boyhood. Nothingremained that had any possible connection with me. The scene of my mother'schildhood, Brownsville, in Brooklyn, is now light-years distant from theculture in which she grew up.            Finding real roots is especially difficult for Jews ofeastern European origin. The shtetl in Belarus that my father left tocome to America as a boy, over 100 years ago, certainly bears no traces of myorigins--if it still exists. Hitler was quite thorough in cutting us off at theroots. Some American Jews do go back to visit the larger eastern Europeancities in which Jews once lived. But the occasion is one for mourning aseparation, not for celebrating a connection. Many Jews find a trace of theirroots in Israel. They can look at those stony fields and think that members oftheir families lived and worked there. But that was a long, long time ago, andthe connection grows faint.            So we--and now I do not speakonly of Jews--come to small New England towns to find our roots and imagine anold family connection. I understand that the "natives," the year-roundresidents, do not want to adopt the visitors into their families--and may evenresent them. But they are courteous. For one thing, they are all in thebusiness of selling roots. And maybe in the long winter nights the "natives"may realize that they are not really natives either, that there were NativeAmericans here before them who have now been cut off from their roots.
