                                 Mars Attacks!                           USA Today leads with PresidentClinton's long-expected veto of a $792 billion Republican-sponsored tax cutbill, which is the off-lead at the Washington Postbut is carried inside elsewhere--Page 22 at the Los Angeles Times . The New YorkTimes lead is the House's passage of a bill that would, if it becamelaw, make it "difficult, it not impossible" to bring large class-action suitsagainst companies such as cigarette or gun manufacturers. The bill draws scantattention elsewhere--the WP runs an AP item aboutit on Page 9. The LAT goes with Jakarta studentstreet riots over a just-passed bill that has raised fears of a coup because itbestows new emergency powers on the Indonesian military. The riots are carriedinside at the WP and NYT . The Post lead is what it sees as aquiet but major shift in Clinton administration Yugoslavia policy: droppingopposition to Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia. The story credits thechange to unnamed senior U.S. officials, while quoting national securityadviser Sandy Berger and State's James Rubin as denying it. Other evidencecited: The U.S. has not resisted the adoption inside Kosovo of the German markas the legal currency and has been supportive of a plan to allow KLA fightersto form a new protective corps for the region.            The NYT lead explains thatthe House bill would require most class action claims to be transferredto federal courts, where the rules about who gets to participate in the classand how such cases may proceed are more stringent. The bill, says the paper,enjoys philosophical and/or lobbying support from some of the nation's biggestbusinesses and business groups. Opponents include the trial lawyers'association and Ralph Nader, William Rehnquist, and 15 state attorneys general.The WP calls the bill's Senate prospects uncertain,whereas according to the Times a similar bill thereenjoys bipartisan support.            The LAT is the only one ofthe papers to front Microsoft President Steve Ballmer's comments yesterday thatU.S. tech stocks are absurdly overpriced, which prompted large sell-offs atNasdaq and the NYSE. The LAT quotes a stockanalyst's observation that Ballmer's timing was bizarre, coming the same daythat Microsoft announced plans to sell shares of its Expedia site as a way toparticipate in the Internet stock trend. The story also observes anothernon-self-aggrandizing angle: Ballmer's own Microsoft stock holdings went down$1.17 billion off his remarks. (By the way, would it have been illegal forBallmer to have sold tech stocks short before making his comments?)            The LAT andNYT front NASA's realization Thursday that theMars Climate Orbiter spacecraft hasprobably burned up in Mars' atmosphere after flying too close to the planet.Both stories go high with the gizmo's price: $125 million.            The WP fronts andUSAT runs on Page 2 word that doctors have for thefirst time ever made a menopausal woman fertile again, by implanting her withpieces of her own ovaries, which had been previously removed and frozen. Shehasn't got pregnant yet but has ovulated and menstruated. The development, thepaper explains, could be a boon to young women with cancer who want to havechildren after treatment is concluded. And eventually it would allow healthyyoung women to put up a bunch of their youthful eggs until they're ready tohave pregnancies using them later in life.            The NYT andWP both go inside with Sen. Daniel Moynihan'sendorsement of Bill Bradley. Moynihan's primary reason for not endorsing AlGore: that the VP can't get elected. Both papers quote a Gore spokesman'sreaction: "I think President Bob Kerrey really appreciated his support in1992."            The Wall StreetJournal reports that energy commodity prices soared Thursday because ofOPEC's announcement that it will keep oil production low throughout the U.S.winter. This means, say quoted analysts, that gas and utility bills could keepgoing up for some time.            The papers carry outraged Republican reactions to PatBuchanan's recent comments about Hitler, from Sen. John McCain, Elizabeth Dole,and Steve Forbes' campaign manager. It's noted that George W. Bush, apparentlystill working on his position on Buchanan (or on Hitler?), has not addressedthe matter yet.            The WSJ "Washington Wire"gives an update on stances taken on the presidential clemency extended toconvicted Puerto Rican terrorists: Al Gore never took a position, but that'sbalanced out by Bill Bradley, who last month supported the deal, but nowopposes it.
