                                 Hillary's Base Motives            The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with the decision by Republican congressional leaders tomeet today with President Clinton at the White House in an attempt to resolvethe partisan budget differences which have left the government operating undera temporary spending bill, which expires this week. USA Todayleads with the government's announcement of new regulations for transplantorgan allocation, to take effect in 30 days. The goal of the revision is toeliminate, as much as possible, the current disparities in recipient waitingtime from state to state and to maximize the chance for the sickest (butsalvageable) patients to receive organs first. The lead at the New York Times is the Clintonadministration's legislative proposal, sent to Congress yesterday, which wouldsteer Medicare beneficiaries towards preferred doctors and hospitals that haveagreed to offer discounted charge rates to the government and to reduce patientfees correspondingly. The White House claim, says the paper, is that theparticipating hospitals would not be financially hurt by the scheme because ofincreased patient volume. But, according to the Times , many Republicansand doctors object, fearing that such a plan will favor low cost over highquality.            The LAT and WP leads report that the main reservation theRepublicans have about jawboning with Clinton on spending is that in the pastwhenever they have, they've gotten their heads handed to them. The big budgetissue, the two papers agree, is whether or not to tap into the current surplusgenerated by Social Security taxes. The Post quotes experts who thinkthat any subsequent budget agreement will tap in, but via "enough budgetgimmicks to obscure the picture."            The LAT fronts, while the WP and NYT run inside, areport released today by the Rand Corp., at the behest of the government, whichsays an experimental anti-nerve gas medication given to up to 300,000 U.S.troops during the Gulf War may be the cause of the host of mysterious chronicillnesses afflicting tens of thousands of Gulf veterans. The LAT andNYT say the report contradicts prior government findings on thehypothesis, while the WP says, "Compared to reviews done previously, itgives somewhat more credence" to it.            The LAT fronts and the Wall Street Journal front-page news box features a mammothreorganization announced by Nissan (by the COO sent over from Renault, whichowns more than one-third of the company): five plant closings, a 14 percentreduction in payroll (21,000 jobs), and $9.48 billion in cost cuts over thenext three years. The good news: the Z car is coming back. The NYT andWP carry the story inside.            Everybody carries word that Ken Starr stepped down yesterday, replaced bycareer prosecutor Robert Ray, whose big job will be producing the OIC's finalreport. Ray obviously has a great sense of humor, thanking Starr Monday for his"extraordinary service to the country at great personal sacrifice over the pastfive years."            The WP reports that while in Washington for a benefit for a writers'organization, Calvin Trillin and Edward Albee declined a proffered invitationto meet with Clarence Thomas. Trillin gave his reason: He didn't like beingtold that he could speak to Justice Thomas only under certain conditions. ThePost 's fall-down here: the story doesn't tell the reader what thoseconditions were.            The NYT runs a front-pager reporting that a presidential panel hasrecommended that the U.S. military be allowed to resume live firing exerciseson Navy property in Puerto Rico--for the next five years. This in the face ofmuch Puerto Rican sentiment against the continued operation of the base, whichhas been particularly strong since April, when one Puerto Rican guard waskilled by a stray bomb from a Marine jet. The Times story notes in itsseventh paragraph that Hillary Clinton registered disappointment in thedecision. The Post inside effort on the bombing range puts Hillary inthe first sentence. Both papers make the connection between HRC's likely NewYork Senate run and her sudden interest in naval aerial trainingfacilities.            A letter to the WP makes an interesting claim about church donations:A surprising percentage of donated monies end up supporting nationaladministrative bureaucracies. The writer states that his own church, the UnitedMethodists, in 1997 paid $1.94 million in salaries and benefits to lobbyists,and another $1.6 million on their conferences, travel, and office expenses.This sum, he says, would enable the Salvation Army to provide two meals a dayfor one year, plus lodging, for about 2,800 people.
