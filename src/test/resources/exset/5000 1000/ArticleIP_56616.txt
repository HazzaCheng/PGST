Bush, responding to TimRussert on Meet the Press : "I really don't. I will if I'm thepresident." What is the question?

Randy's Wrap-Up                        Most responses assumethat G.W. is a stupid, hollow man kept afloat by his own vanity and theself-interest of his rich supporters. So why hasn't stupidity torpedoed him theway it did Dan Quayle? And can this be explained without resorting to thephrase "dumbing down" or alluding to the questions on that Who Wants a BigBucket of Money quiz show being multiple choice about the BradyBunch , not like in the old days, when quiz show questions were so hard thatyou had to cheat to win, and presidential candidates all spoke in fullsentences, in iambic pentameter, in Latin, while wearing complicated wigs andfancy hats and several layers of underwear with fastenings so elaborate you hadto be like a genius just to undress for one of your Naked Fireside Chats fromthe Aero White House, a giant dirigible moored to Zelda Fitzgerald. I guesswhat I'm saying is that maybe times haven't changed all that much and thatstupid people are the same all over the world. And if they're not, why hasn'tTime magazine done one of those marvelous trend-spotting covers on TheNew New Stupidity Stupidity?                           Answer  er Question , No, Answer                        Tim Russert: Do you haveany opinion of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a possible successor toPresident Boris Yeltsin?                           Some Other Meet the Press Moments*                        T.R.: Would you accept aninvitation to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, the homosexual politicalgroup?            G.W.:All that does is create a huge political, you know, nightmare for people. I'drather meet with the least tolerant, most reactionary wing of the party  andrich people, of course.            T.R.: Do you supportadoption by gay parents?            G.W.:I believe that society ought to aim for the ideal. And the ideal is for a manand woman to adopt a child. They should beat it regularly with a stick, educateit in a Christian academy so it won't get confused by, you know, learning, thenthrow it on the barbecue and eat it, and then we can all get high again, likewhen we were young and  is this thing on?            *Finalsentence added by News Quiz.
