                                 Wild Turkey            Commenting Wednesday onTurkey's capture of the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, the press acrosswestern Europe made two principal demands: that Ocalan should not be executed,as Turkish law allows, and that Turkey should seize this opportunity to reach apeaceful settlement of its Kurdish problem. It was also generally accepted inboth Europe and the Middle East that U.S. intelligence was deeply involved inOcalan's mysterious delivery from the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, where hehad been sheltering, to an island prison near Istanbul.                           El Mundo of Madrid rana front-page story on the CIA's involvement in Ocalan's "kidnapping,"quoting a Turkish government source as saying that "the North American secretservices alerted us to his whereabouts." The same paper carried an exclusiveinterview with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who said itis entirely up to the judiciary to decide if Ocalan should receive a deathsentence.            The paper led its front page with Ecevit saying that hehopes there will now be a solution to the Kurdish problem, though in theinterview he spoke of achieving this not through greater political autonomy, asthe Kurds demand, but through economic improvements in the southeast region ofTurkey where they live. In an editorial Tuesday in the English-language paper,Turkish Daily News , Ilnur Cevik wrote that Ecevit and Iraqi VicePresident Tariq Aziz recently agreed to a resumption of oil sales and bordertrade between southeast Turkey and Iraq, which had been interrupted by theAmerican and British bombing campaign. Cevik said Turkey should now press for alifting of sanctions against Iraq, and called on Baghdad "to utilize our uniqueposition as a friend and neighbor of Iraq to be able to integrate back into theinternational community."            Mohammad Noureddin, aleading Arab expert on Turkish affairs, told the London-based Mideast Mirrornews service Tuesday that Ocalan's "handover to Turkey by Greece via U.S.intelligence suggests that Washington may be poised for a major operation inIraq in which it needs to enlist Ankara." Reporting the Israeli government'sdenial that it had been in any way involved, Ha'aretz saidWednesday that the denial was in response to Kurd suspicions based, in part, ona column written earlier this month in the New York Times by WilliamSafire, who had said that "U.S. and Israeli intelligence and diplomats" werehelping to track down Ocalan.            The rioting of Kurds across Europe Tuesday, with burningsand hostage-takings at Greek and Kenyan diplomatic missions, alarmed Europeannewspapers and generated countless pages of comment and analysis. Theseincluded much self-criticism. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Wednesday in a front-pageeditorial that Germany, which has a large Kurdish immigrant population, hasdamaged both its own constitution and international agreements on terrorism byrefusing to request Ocalan's extradition from Italy last month, when it had aninternational arrest warrant out on him. The paper also warned of the influencethe affair will have on Germany's highly charged debate about the integrationof immigrants into German society.            The Rome newspaperLa Repubblicaaccused Germany of breaking European Union accords, with the result that "thewhole territory of Germany is in a state of siege by the Kurd intifada." Theeditorial went on to say that Europe should take a common position towardTurkey, "clarifying that its aspirations to membership of Europe will bestrictly dependent on the way it manages Ocalan's destiny. ... A country thatdoesn't respect the rights of defendants and which practices the death penaltydoesn't have the right to be part of Europe." In Paris, Le Figaro said that Ankarashould "judge Ocalan with all the guarantees due to him, to prove that Turkeyis a state founded on the law." It added, "This is an essential condition forany settlement of the Kurd question." Libration called for "a political solution thatnecessarily requires a radical decentralization. ... It is here that the roleof the United States, which played a big part in Ocalan's arrest and which forthe moment can only see him as a terrorist, could be decisive."            In an interview with the British youth magazinethe Face , supermodel Kate Moss revealed that she hadn't walked soberdown the runway for 10 years. Moss, 25, who last year checked into a Londonrehabilitation clinic, said that she and her fellow models drank champagne fromearly in the morning and smoked pot all day.
