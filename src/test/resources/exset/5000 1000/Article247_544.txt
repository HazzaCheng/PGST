                                 House Call                           USAToday leads with the tough prison sentence given to an ex-aide to MikeEspy and what it might mean to the dramatis personae of the Clinton sexscandal. The Washington Post leads with word that Newt Gingrich andHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde agreed yesterday to form a smallgroup of House members that would check to see if Kenneth Starr's investigationhas accumulated evidence of an impeachable offense. The national edition of theNew York Timesgoes with the conclusion by a panel of educational experts that bothold-fashioned phonics and new-fashioned "whole-language" methods are valuablefor teaching reading. The metro edition of the Times leads with theunanimous decision by the New York City Board of Education to requireelementary school kids to wear uniforms. The top national story in the metroedition is the president's criticism of the GOP budget. The Los AngelesTimes lead continues the close look the paper has been taking lately atlocal and state prisons. On the heels of indictments of prison officials inconnection with an inmate death at Corcoran prison, the paper reports thatfederal investigators are now looking into assaults and slayings of inmates attwo other state facilities.            The judge in the Espy aide case ignored the sentencing guidelinerecommendation of probation to hand down a 27-month sentence for lying, andwhile doing so, referred darkly to a "Hollywood" lawyer and others who havesuggested that lying under oath in a civil case isn't a big deal. USATimplies the "Hollywood" tag was meant to refer to Monica Lewinsky's LosAngeles-based lawyer, William Ginsburg. The paper concludes the judge wanted to"send a message to key players in the White House intern scandal." The sentenceis also covered inside at the WP .            According to the Post , the House select group agreed to by Gingrich and Hyde wouldinclude Democrats and will probably examine Starr's evidence at Starr's officeto avoid the leaky consequences of the House of Representatives rule makingmaterial in the files of any standing committee available to any member.            The NYT reports that President Clinton used sharply partisan languagein knocking the Republican budget before a cheering,sympathetic crowd of AFL-CIO members in Las Vegas, saying it "shortchanges ournation's future," by eliminating his new initiatives on education, job trainingand child care. Meanwhile, back in Washington, reports the Times , theSenate Budget Committee approved the Republican tax and spending plan on astraight party-line vote, after defeating several Democratic attempts toreinstate the Clinton initiatives. The Clinton speech also gets front space atthe WP .            The Wall Street Journal "Business Bulletin" reports that ittakes about six years for a new consumer product to take off. That probablyseems long to investors, but, says the Journal , before World War II ittook about eighteen years.            A Clinton White House executive order from a few years back requires the CIAand other government agencies to release every classified document in thearchives that's more than 25 years-old. A WSJ front-page featurevisits the CIA facility that's doing the declassificationwork, editing out sensitive information line by line. And it's a lot ofwork--there are 65 million pages to review. Where's the facility? That's asecret .            Right now, the press is in a big respectability-puffing, nose-holding phasein its reporting of the Clinton sex scandals, deploring--in exquisitedetail--having to cover all that executive branch breastage and groinage. Agood clue to how insincere that all is comes in a letter to the WP . "The press coverage of MonicaLewinsky and her problems," a reader notes, "has mentioned little or nothingabout the [White House] intern program in which she was employed." Here at lastis a legitimate story related to the scandals that's not itself salacious--soof course, it hasn't been done.
