                                 McCain Takes the Plunge            Mount Pleasant, S. C.--The usual insurgent candidate's strategy, which hasnot actually worked in 20 years in the GOP, is to score upsets in Iowa and NewHampshire. John McCain has a slightly different idea. Because of hislong-standing opposition to ethanol subsidies, he is simply bypassing the Iowacaucuses. Instead, he's running in New Hampshire and South Carolina, whichholds the next primary after New Hampshire.            South Carolina is promising for McCain for two reasons. The first is thatit's a state filled with conservative Republicans--for whom McCain hopes toemerge as the only viable alternative to George W. Bush. The second reason isthat it is rich in military retirees and veterans, who regard McCain as one oftheir own, just as they did Bob Dole in 1996.            Hence the setting for his South Carolina announcement: a podium dressed withblack POW-MIA flags, with the carrier USS Yorktown as a backdrop. Theship was once part of the World War II fleet commanded by McCain'sgrandfather--a connection noted by McCain. On the deck was an A-4 Skyhawk, thetype of plane McCain was flying when he was shot down over Hanoi--anassociation noted by Larry Grooms, the South Carolina state senator whointroduced him. "While some were out dodging the draft, John McCain wasvolunteering for active service in Vietnam," Grooms reminded theaudience--which was sprinkled with purple- and orange-haired teen-agers as wellas vets. Whether the reference was to Clinton or Bush, or both, wasunclear.            McCain's speech was a version of the one he gave yesterday in New Hampshire,culminating in his refrain "I am not afraid." McCain's speeches are extremelywell written, thanks to his gifted ghost Mark Salter, who helped write his bookFaith of My Fathers . They are not terribly well delivered by thecandidate, who stumbles more in one speech than Bill Clinton does in a year'sworth of them. But both the prose and the delivery have the appeal ofdirectness and sincerity.            The most interesting thing about today's announcement was what was left outat the last minute. An earlier version of the prepared speech included asemi-direct attack on George W. Bush's education proposal. A preliminary draftof his speech, passed out in advance, read: "There are those who would insteadpropose a larger role for the federal government. One of my opponents wants toallow the Department of Education to cut off money to underprivileged childrenif those children do not improve their test scores over a three-yearperiod."            But McCain did not deliver this criticism of Bush. Instead he cut straightto the next paragraph, which draws an implicit distinction instead of anexplicit one. "While I applaud the effort to hold schools accountable for themoney they receive, I would strongly oppose any program that would give powerover the lives of children to a federal bureaucrat." McCain will certainlyattack Bush--he has to. But he may have decided that it makes sense toestablish a positive message before going negative on the Republicanfront-runner.            It's interesting to compare the two education plans. Where Bush's plan is afederally directed quasi-voucher scheme, McCain's is a federally funded voucherexperiment that emphasizes local control. McCain's plan is more honest thanBush's in some respects. For one thing, McCain is willing to spend newmoney--$5.4 billion over three years. And he's explicit about where he'd getit--by cutting corporate welfare, specifically federal subsidies for sugar,oil, and ethanol (suggesting that he's intending to write off Texas and Hawaiias well as Iowa).            McCain's vouchers would be worth more than Bush's--$2,000 vs. $1,500. Theproblem is that that's still not enough to determine whether vouchers work.$2,000 would pay tuition only at some Catholic parochial schools. This raisesConstitutional questions, but beyond that, it's not enough to create genuinecompetitive pressure on bad public schools, which is the point ofvouchers--unless you think the goal is to replace public education with privateeducation.            That said, McCain has some great lines about education. "There's no reasonon earth that a good teacher should be paid less than a bad senator," hesays.            And this one, even better: "Some people just aren't meant to be teachers,and we should help them find another line of work," he says. This draws wildapplause from the school kids at the front of the stage, who may think McCainis promising to fire their teachers.
