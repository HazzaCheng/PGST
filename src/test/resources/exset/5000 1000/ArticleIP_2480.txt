                                 The Sound of One Hand Talking            Last week, John HopeFranklin, the venerable Duke University historian and chair of the president'sadvisory board on race, told reporters that his panel would refuse to hear fromopponents of affirmative action in higher education. This policy seems bothwrong in principle and politically foolish. Why on earth have a panel dedicatedto racial reconciliation and exclude one of the two views that need to bereconciled on the most divisive racial issue? What harm could come from lettingcritics have their say, compared with the harm of seeming to censor them?Franklin's only explanation was an imperious, "I'm not certain what [Californiaaffirmative-action critic Ward] Connerly could contribute to thisdiscussion."            A seniorofficial working with the panel is a bit less opaque. "The point of thecommittee is to help formulate White House policy. So why should we appointpeople who disagree with the President? Why hear testimony from people whovehemently disagree with him?" Another member of the panel's staff said, "Thisis not the Kerner Commission," referring to the panel appointed by PresidentJohnson after the urban riots of the 1960s.            President Clinton said the panel's mission was to be "agreat and unprecedented conversation about race." But apparently the mainpurpose of convening the committee's monthly meetings is to provide an occasionfor the administration to unveil installments of the President's RaceInitiative--a yearlong parade of minipolicies. Last week, for instance, theWhite House announced that $15 million would be divided among 67 differentnonprofit groups so they can bring more housing-discrimination cases.            The WhiteHouse concocts these policies, without say from committee members. Behind theinflated rhetoric, the Franklin panel has only a slim mandate and little power.It is not legally allowed to meet in private and cannot even write its ownfinal report--prerequisites for any self-respecting commission.            Another bit of the explanation concerns thepeople running the panel. In theory, John Hope Franklin is the perfect chairfor an anodyne exercise in racial reconciliation. His public image is that ofan avuncular Southern gentleman. Franklin is the Jackie Robinson of historians:the first black chair of an integrated history department and the first blackpresident of the major American history associations. His most important booksrewrote 90 years of wrongheaded, often racist, historiography ofReconstruction. (The black carpetbaggers, who ruled parts of the Southfollowing the Civil War, were sincere democrats, he proved, not venaldictators.)            But overthe last decade, Franklin's lectures and essays on race have acquired apessimistic, angry edge. He laments the permanence of racism, which he feels isnow deeply entrenched in almost every American institution. Franklin, whoresearched briefs for Brown vs. Board and marched in Selma, expected thecivil-rights revolution to remake society. Instead of dramatic change, he seesonly marginal improvement and enduring black urban poverty, job discrimination,and even Jim Crow attitudes. And he says those who ignore the extent of thisracism are not only mistaken but also racist. They "have no interest inachieving a color-blind society and would be horrified if we even approachedit."            Franklin is old. The real power in the panel rests withHarvard law Professor Christopher Edley Jr. Edley plans the committee strategyand will write the final report on race relations. As a White House aide inClinton's first term, Edley was author of the administration'scharacteristically nuanced (or, if you prefer, mushy and having-it-both-ways)"mend it, don't end it" policy for affirmative action. But since leaving thegovernment, Edley has become more shrill. In a round-table debate on theAtlantic Monthly 's Web site, he repeatedly calls opponents ofaffirmative action "counterrevolutionaries." He says, "Though their oppositionto these measures is framed as principle, certainly their real goal is toprotect the current distribution of privilege and opportunity that has producedwhite-male elites in virtually every sector." Most recently, Edley has calledAmerica in Black and White , Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom'santi-affirmative-action tome, a "crime against humanity."            Edley and Franklin areentitled to their views, which may even be correct. But should people with suchstrident opinions be responsible for a panel on racial reconciliation? It seemsespecially stupid for the administration to spew platitudes about the panel'smission of healing if its intention was to push one side of a contentiousdebate.
