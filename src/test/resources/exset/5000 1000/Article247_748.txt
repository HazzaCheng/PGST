                                 Cost of Livingston            Everybody leads with the jockeying in the House of Representatives for theSpeaker's gavel. Everybody has Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana as thepresumptive victor. But USA Today , the Washington Post , and the New York Timestreat the alternative effort of Rep. Christopher Cox as, albeit fading, stillon the table, while the Los Angeles Times snags a late Sunday nightinterview with Cox in which he says he can't match Livingston's vote count. Theleads also note that several other top House Republican slots are likely to becontested in the party vote coming up on November 18th.            The NYT makes the point that Livingston, Cox and other members of theRepublican House leadership used the Sunday chat shows to politick for their jobs, anunprecedented exercise. And an odd one, since the offices at stake arecompletely controlled by GOP caucus and House votes. The Post notes this trend too and quotes some other members ofCongress who don't much like it.            The WP and USAT emphasize the main reason most HouseRepublicans wanted the tongue of Newt: they say he was a lousy manager. (Nowthey tell us.) "There was really no clear agenda for the year. And when there'sno agenda and there's no real direction, what happens is you can't, you reallycan't have a message," Rep. John Boehner is quoted saying in the Post .And then he drives the point home with a little too much information abouthimself: "You can put lipstick on a pig all day long, but it's still apig."            It's not enough that this story leads all around. The papers also try toportray it as exciting. The NYT speaks of members having "scurried" backto Washington to participate in "party brawls," and the LAT calls theepisode "dramatic" and "a fast-moving tale." That Speakermania grips the papersthis way shows they're a bit out of touch with what seems to be the point oflast week's election results: the public doesn't care about what Washingtoncares about. The LAT redeems itself though, by making the only valuablepolicy point lurking in all this. Livingston, the paper notes in a sidebar toits lead, isn't locking up the nomination because of his ideology, policy orpersonal style. It's his money --the $2 million he's given to Republicancandidates and party organizations from his own campaign PAC. The paper pointsout that such personal "leadership" PACs allow members to take in and disbursemore and bigger donations than are allowed by the limits on contributions toindividual members.                           USAT 's front reports that the Supreme Court, irked about lastspring's tell-all book by an ex-clerk about the Court's inner workings, hastold this term's clerks that the Supremes' secrets are to be kept "forever."The paper points out that this stricture is not legally binding. USATgoes on to note that a federal judge in California, Alex Kozinski, thinks theauthor, now an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, broke the law and hence,the prosecutor is "no longer welcome" to appear before him. The story does notexplain how a judge can control which government attorneys try cases in hiscourt.            The Wall Street Journal reports that just a few months afterannouncing economic sanctions against India and Pakistan in response to the twonations' atomic bomb tests, the Clinton White House has dropped many ofthem--those that were holding up deals involving U.S. firms such as Boeing andGE. Sanctions preventing lending by international financial institutions remainin force. (The U.S. has decided to waive even these in the case of Pakistan,but no such loan has actually been consummated yet.)                           USAT , which has always been sensitive to aviation safety stories,follows up yesterday's WP report on the FAA's decision to change the wayelectrical wiring insulation on airliners is tested for flammability with a"Money" section package of stories covering various aspects of the problem.It's sobering to learn that about half the world's passenger jets contain wireinsulation that could be a fire hazard. One expert quoted calls wiring the mostserious issue in aviation today.            The LAT reports on the activities of a women's group dedicated to fighting negative images of Jewishwomen in the media. The story says that what they're fighting is thedepiction of Jewish women as "pushy, controlling, selfish, unattractive,materialistic, high-maintenance, shallow, domineering...." A fine goal, but thegroup has its work cut out for it--the most prominent Jewish woman this yearpretty much fits those pejoratives to a T and the media didn't make her up:Monica Lewinsky.
