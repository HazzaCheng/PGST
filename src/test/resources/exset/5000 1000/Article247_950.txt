                                 Headline                        Hi Katha,                   Yes, my morning ablutions are complete, and I know it's noon. I'vejust caffeinated, taken three viracepts, one combivir, four rescriptors, onezantac, one immodium, one zoloft, and one propecia. Who needs oatmeal? But thegood news is: I'm alive and my hair is growing back.       In fact, I was so zippy I missed Charlie Moskos' letter. Whenever I'vedealt with him he has seemed an extremely reasonable fellow (he wrote a goodpiece for me at TNR on race in the ranks) but, like many military types,he just seems to lose it when it comes to the obvious fact that homosexualshave been happily murdering and killing in uniform for generations. At least hedidn't push the off-the-record spin that these nellies just can't hack it,which is what Pentagon flunkies were whispering to gullible journalists. Healso misses a very basic point: The 563 violations were by commanders, notsoldiers. It's rather like holding turkeys responsible for Thanksgiving. As tothe notion that gay soldiers disproportionately leave early, this only appliesto new discharges. How does Moskos explain the enormous increase? Could itpossibly be that bigoted commanders, who hate the idea that they might have totolerate discreet homosexuals in the ranks, now try to flush them out early andfast by massive amounts of intimidation? In Italy, a Marine first sergeant isreported by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network to greet new unit memberswith the declaration "There are three things I hate: liars, thieves, andfaggots." Nice to meet you, too.       A final thought. It's interesting that Moskos is aware, as someone inhis position would never have been a generation ago, that young people do "comeout" at an earlier and earlier age. Society has changed enormously. So all thepolicy is doing, it seems, if he is correct, is successfully flushing out awhole swath of young men and women who have the self-respect not to be ashamedof being gay. Should the military be happy it's getting rid of all these peopleand becoming less, rather than more, like the society it's supposed to defend?And is the presence of these people--who are often disproportionately committedto their jobs--such a threat to the effectiveness of the military as a whole?Or are we better off with a bunch of conflicted, repressed neurotics?       As to welfare mothers, I share your abhorrence of the guy who demeanedmotherhood, although I am probably uniquely unqualified to talk about itsonerous responsibilities. My sister has two small children, though, and sheworks harder than I ever have in my life. Or ever will. But the appositequestion, it seems to me, is not simply whether day care is adequate (it almostcertainly isn't) but whether, as a whole, it is better that, whatever thecurrent problems, the old system has been shaken up and reformed in thedirection of work. Of course, welfare bureaucracies being what they are, a lackof support in health care and day care is hardly surprising. But the answer tothat is to fix the health care and day care with some of the large amounts ofmoney being sent back to the states rather than to return to what happenedbefore. Or am I wrong? Is your position that welfare mothers were better off independency and close to their kids rather than in work and distant (for some ofthe time) from their kids? I'd be crazy to believe the new system is perfect orwithout its injustices. But isn't it an improvement on what went on before? Andisn't it at least a more constructive place from which to improve policy thanold-style entitlement?       My nomination for the most boring story of the day: bank mergers. Andanything to do with Mike Ovitz. Who really gives a damn about Hollywood moguls?And doesn't The New Yorker fellate them enough for the Times tostop covering them? I loved the story on Kathy Bates, though. What a babe. Ithought the Primary Colors movie was unconvincingly crude--can anyonebelieve for a moment that George Stephanopoulos was ever deeply, morallyconflicted about anything?--but Bates was great. Along with George Michael,she's my newly discovered icon.            Cheers,Andrew
