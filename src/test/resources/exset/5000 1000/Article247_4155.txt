                                 <I>Kausfiles</I> Drills Down!                           English Maybe: Remember Proposition 227, the initiative by which (intheory) California voters threw out that state's disastrous bilingual educationprogram and replaced it with "English immersion"? For an excellent, maddeningreport on how anti-227 school administrators and teachers in Los Angeles aredefying the law and continuing to teach "limited English" children in Spanish,read Jill Stewart's recent New Times Los Angeles account. ... The questionbegged by Stewart's story is: Isn't it time for some pro-227 parents to sue toget that law enforced? As it is, the main lawsuit on the table in Los Angelesis being brought by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund(MALDEF), which is trying to get the Los Angeles school board to enter into asemi-collusive "consent decree" that will effectively undermine Englishimmersion. Stewart describes this possible sellout to MALDEF here. ... Those districts that really do try English immersion,according to Stewart, have seen rising test scores. They include Sacramento,Inglewood, and Oceanside. Time for some national reporters from theWashington Post and New York Times to pay them a visit, no? ReneSanchez, this means you! ...                           Reader Nails:                Kausfiles reader Michael S. Nadel of Washington,D.C., had this reponse to the previousitem, which concluded that Larry Flynt's investigation of congressional sex"served Clinton well" by possibly helping to cow House Speaker Newt Gingrich(who was at the time have a risky affair with a congressional aide):                           How did Newt's silence "serve Clinton well"? Wouldn't having Gingrich as hismain antagonist have helped Clinton? He would have had a foil even better thanKen Starr--even without the Bisek affair in the public eye.                        Good question! Here two possible answers: 1) Gingrich's low-turnout,put-em-to-sleep strategy for the 1998 election was a disaster, which in turnencouraged Republican senators to acquit the president. A different, moreactive GOP House election strategy might have worked better, but it might alsohave required that Gingrich take a higher profile (and, inevitably, attackClinton); 2) Bet if you'd asked Clinton's aides in the spring of 1998 whetherthey'd rather have an unencumbered Gingrich or a subdued Gingrich, they wouldhave picked the latter--even if, in hindsight, that might have been a mistakencalculation.                           A                plea to my colleagues: Please, please stop calling the oldFairfax Hotel, where the young Al Gore lived, a "luxury Washington hotel," asPBS did a few nights ago. During the '60s, when my family took a vacation tosee the East Coast sights, we stayed at the Fairfax, because (we were told) itwas the cheapest hotel in town. I remember it as a decent, shabby oldthing--not a fleapit, but nothing that attempted to be in any way sybaritic. Mymother remembers that we got a whole suite for something like $14 a day. ...Only much later, with Al Gore long gone, was the building refurbished andturned into an overpriced luxury hotel, once part of the Ritz chain, now calledthe Westin-Fairfax. ... Charles Peters made this very point in his "Tilting at Windmills" column in the Washington Monthlylast May, but to no avail. ... Peters even pointed out that the Fairfax wasso affordable Meg Greenfield lived there as a young reporter. ...                           Yent-a-Matic update : A recentedition of the authoritative Yent-a-Matic paired up Robert Torricelli, thepublicity-seeking chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,with Arianna Huffingon, the publicity-seeking bleeding-heart conservativecolumnist. As far as I know, this high-potential matchup has not yet beenrealized. But Torricelli is going out with MSNBC pundette LauraIngraham, which is about as close as you can get to going out with AriannaHuffington without going out with Arianna Huffington ... Kausfiles stillcontends that Torricelli-Huffington is inevitable, sort of like globalization,or the collapse of communism in Cuba. ... No point trying to fight history,Bob! ...
