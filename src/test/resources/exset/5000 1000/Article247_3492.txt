                                 The Lamest Company on the Planet                        Today's topic is Planet Hollywood, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy aweek ago. And today's question is: Won't someone just put this dog out of itsmisery?            Planet Hollywood, a trailblazer in the booming field of cheesycelebrity-themed restaurants featuring mediocre food, has been struggling foralmost three years now. It has reported shrinking earnings, which eventuallyturned into losses, in every quarter in the last two fiscal years. If even athird of the 80 restaurants it owns around the world are making money, I'd beshocked. And since April, the company has been in default on $250 million worthof junk bonds. Trading in the company's stock has been suspended, and theannouncement of Chapter 11 means that the stock is essentially worthless. (Thusdemonstrating the important lesson that buying a cheap stock because you'resure it can't go any lower is a mistake.)            It's hard to feel sorry for either the bondholders or the stockholders,since this was a train wreck you could have seen coming a mile away. (Clickhere foran earlier piece on Planet Hollywood.) But the company's proposed restructuringplan is nonetheless dismaying. It keeps current management in place and handsover 70 percent of the equity in the company to an investor group comprisingtwo of Planet Hollywood's largest shareholders for what is, relativelyspeaking, a small investment of $30 million. Current shareholders will probablywalk away with nothing, current bondholders will get less than 50 cents on thedollar (and that's if everything goes perfectly), while current CEO Robert Earland Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal will get most of the new company.            Still, my dismay is contained by the fact that 70 percent of nothing isnothing, and in the end it seems clear that that's all Planet Hollywood isworth. The striking thing about the restructuring plan is not that the equityis being redistributed but that so much energy is being put into an enterprisethe upside of which seems so small. Why, after all, do we need a PlanetHollywood? There isn't a ravenous consumer demand that is going unmet. Themedrestaurants have a terrible track record. And the restaurant business ingeneral is capital-intensive, high-risk, and low-reward.            In that sense, the fact that Planet Hollywood won't just die testifies totwo things: the continued strength of inertia in American business and thecontinued distance between the interests of corporate managers and corporateshareholders. Despite all the talk about the Schumpeterian gales of creativedestruction that are raging through the American economy (and they areraging), there are still plenty of businesses that stay alive just because theyare alive. In an ideal economy, capital will migrate away from inefficient andunproductive businesses and toward productive businesses.            But even though in the long run that does happen in the U.S. economy (asevidenced by the steady decline of Planet Hollywood's stock price, forinstance), and even though it happens here much more than in any othercountry's economy, the "long run" can be very long indeed. And sometimes themere fact that a company exists can be enough to trick investors into believingthat it should exist. In a perfect world, Planet Hollywood would havedisappeared two years ago, at the point when it became clear that the noveltyof the business had worn off and that all the future held was empty restaurantsand mounting losses.            The other thing keeping the company afloat is that it's been run by peoplewho were taking home nice salaries and plenty of corporate perks even as theywere destroying shareholder value with each passing day. For Planet Hollywoodinvestors, the best thing would have been the liquidation of the company, whichwould have let them take their money and put it into real companies. But forPlanet Hollywood executives, liquidation would have meant an end to their jobs.If you're being paid well to be captain, it's a lot better to let the shipslowly sink, even if scuttling it is what's best for everyone on board.            In today's hypercompetitive world, it's easy to believe that Andy Grove isright, and that only the paranoid survive. But when you look at how tenaciouslyPlanet Hollywood is clinging to life, it seems clear that even fools cansurvive. Perhaps what only the paranoid do is thrive.
