                                 Secrets and Spies            The Los AngelesTimes , USAToday , and the NewYork Times lead with follow-ups on the Los Angeles day-care shootings.The WashingtonPost goes with anonymously sourced reports of Chinese militaryplotting against Taiwan, a story fronted by the NYT . The Wall Street Journal places atop its "Worldwide" box theEnergy Department's decision to seek punishment in a botched nuclear-espionageinvestigation, a story fronted by USAT and the NYT . All thepapers front countdown stories to Saturday's Iowa straw poll.            Follow-up to the Los Angeles shooting takes different forms. In theLAT , a four-column headline reveals that suspect Buford Furrow hadconsidered unloading his weapons at three prominent local Jewish sites: theMuseum of Tolerance, the Skirball Cultural Center, and the University ofJudaism. (The Post also mentions that he scouted three locations.) Butafter finding security there too tight, he stumbled upon the North ValleyJewish Community Center. USAT's follow-up focuses on proposals byAttorney General Janet Reno for more federal gun regulation. The story fails todefine clearly what Reno actually proposed (it summarizes one of her proposalsas simply, "federal limits on handgun purchases") and never mentions what lawsare on the books already. The NYT details how schools are takingelaborate precautions against shootings, despite federal reports thatgun-carrying and violence in schools have actually declined this year.Simulated shootings in schools in Florida and Pennsylvania, for instance, havefeatured SWAT teams, helicopters, ersatz pipe bombs, and drama studentssporting fake wounds. The director of a superintendents' lobby group sums upthe mood nicely when he tells the NYT : "Everyone feels the need to dosomething, even though no one agrees on what that should be."            The NYT and WP report that Chinese Embassy officials andvisiting military advisers and scholars have hinted that the Chinese governmentis considering a blockade of some small Taiwan-controlled islands, a small airbattle, or perhaps an incursion into Taiwanese waters to punish the nation forits recent talk of independence. Both stories, sourced to "experts" and"Clinton administration officials," assert that the threat is unlikely butnonetheless real. The Post says any action would likely occur after anOctober Clinton-Jiang Zemin summit in New Zealand. "We have some time to playwith, but we're not out of the woods," an unnamed U.S. source intonesominously.            The WSJ and USAT report Energy Secretary Bill Richardson'srecommendation that three Los Alamos officials be punished for their failure toproperly investigate espionage allegations against fired employee Wen Ho Lee.(Since Los Alamos is run by the University of California, Richardson can onlyrecommend disciplinary action.) The officials, fingered by the agency'sinspector general, were not named, but a "department source" tellsUSAT that one of them is former lab director (now senior fellow)Siegfried Hecker. The WSJ's "Washington Wire" reports that Richardsonwill make amends with several DOE whistle-blowers in the espionage scandal whohad been punished rather than rewarded for speaking up. "There was a totalbreakdown of the system and there's plenty of blame to go around," Richardsonsaid.            The NYT publishes a below-the-fold headline that almost reads likea satirical teaser in TheOnion : "In Intense but Little-Noticed Fight, Allies Have Bombed IraqAll Year." It seems that over the last eight months, American and Britishpilots have fired on more than triple the number of targets attacked in lastDecember's highly publicized Iraqi attack and have flown two-thirds as manymissions as NATO pilots flew against Yugoslavia in 78 days. This is a curiousstory: It is hard news reported almost as if it were a trend, and it is peggedpartly to its own absence in the very newspaper in which it now appears.            An LAT "Column One" story describes how the spouse of nearly every2000 presidential candidate was pulled along reluctantly, albeit willingly:"Gore is Mrs. Gung-Ho; McCain is Mrs. Stay-At-Home; Quayle is Mrs.Experience-With-Gritted-Teeth; Bush is Mrs. Traditional-Yet-Cautious; andBradley is Ms. Modern-But-Nave-About-Politics." And the one male spouse? "Doleis Mr. Foot-In-The-Mouth."
