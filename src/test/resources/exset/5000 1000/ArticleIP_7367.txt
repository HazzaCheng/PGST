                                                            VoteHere                        We don't wish to seem likewhat our colleague David Plotz refers to as "Turnout Bores,"but it really is a pity if you missed the chance to exercise that precious giftof democracy, your right to vote, Tuesday. What the high-minded Turnout Boresusually fail to emphasize in their tiresome calls to moral responsibility ("Howcan you leave all those referendums untouched when children are starving inRussia?") is that voting is fun.            Havingbeen through those huge postwar sci-fi voting machines, and then those infernalpunch-card contraptions seemingly designed to deny the franchise to the bottomnine-tenths of the bell curve, we especially enjoyed the new technologicalbreakthrough adopted by the election board (or whoever) here in suburbanSeattle. It works this way: You are given a piece of paper listing thecandidates and propositions (a "ballot"), you indicate your choices using adevice called (we believe) a "felt-tipped pen," then you deposit the piece ofpaper through a slot in a large container called a "ballot box." What happensto the piece of paper after that we neither know nor care--having voted andthus earned our right to feel smug all day. This being the Pacific Northwest,the ballot is undoubtedly recycled. But if the citizens who open and empty theballot box can suppress their eagerness to recycle these pieces of paper longenough to count them first, so much the better.            In case you did miss voting Tuesday, or even if you voted,here is another chance. Nothing so trivial as control of Congress is at stake.The issue is this: Should                   Slate on Paper                include everythingpublished in                   Slate                the previous week or only as much as can becrammed into 44 standard-size pages?                   Slate on Paper                is the textdocument we prepare every Friday morning. It is available to subscribers bydownload from slate.com, by e-mail,or (for $70, including your basic online                   Slate                subscription) inan actual paper edition through the U.S. mail.            Right now we limit                  Slate on Paper                to 44 pages because a) we doubt many people wouldwish to download and print out more than that; and b) the snail mailed version(which believe it or not is just a break-even proposition for us) would have tocost more like $100 than $70 if it gets any heavier. But as                   Slate               has grown, this policy has required us to exclude more and more. And somereaders have complained that when they print out                   Slate               , they wantall of it. (Actually, our reader surveys suggest that about half ofthose who download the text document read it on-screen rather than printing itout. For these folks, presumably, size is not as much of an issue.)            We are ina genuine quandary. We exist only to give pleasure but are unsure in this casehow to maximize your pleasure in                   Slate               . So we decided to take avote. Highly unscientific, of course, but (like all voting) fun. Readers whohave never used                   Slate on Paper                in any of its myriad forms, andhave no intention of doing so, should please sit on their hands. The rest ofyou: Please vote now. We have done our best to word the question in a neutralway, giving unfair advantage to neither side. We reserve the right, of course,to ignore the voters' wishes. Just like in a real election.            The official language of this referendum is as follows:            Should                   Slate onPaper               , the weekly text version of                   Slate                magazine, belimited to just 44 pages, no matter how much wonderful writing and brilliantinsight must be excluded as a result? Or should                   Slate on Paper               include everything published online at slate.com the previous week, no matterhow many pages it takes or how long the Breakfast Tablers or Book Clubbersblather on?                           Theoptions:                        "And you call yourselveseditors? Well, edit for heaven's sake. 44 pages is plenty." (Vote: 44pages .)            "Look, I paid 20 bucks forthis rag, and I want all of it. Don't give me this crap about how the crabclaws wouldn't fit on the smorgasbord table." (Vote: Without limit .)                           --Michael Kinsley
