                                 Gross Film Gross            The Washington Post , New York Times ,and LosAngeles Times lead with last night's agreement by Republican House andSenate leaders on a tax cut bill. (The Democrats weren't invited to thediscussions.) USA Today goes inside with that story and leads insteadwith the first guilty plea in the Salt Lake Olympics bribery scandal, a storynobody else fronts. The plea bargain describes phony paperwork designed tofalsely portray as a salary payments made by Salt Lake Olympic officials to theson of an influential IOC member from South Korea.            All the papers note that the GOP compromise tax bill, imposing an aggregate cut of $792billion, provides for a reduction of one percentage point in all income taxrates. There's also a drop in the top rate on capital gains, from 20 percentdown to 18, a reduction in the "marriage penalty" for many couples filingjointly, and a phase-out of the inheritance tax that now applies to largeestates. The tax rate reductions are conditioned on continued success atreducing the national debt. President Clinton has vowed to veto any billputting this much of the budget surplus toward tax relief. The LAT andWall Street Journal point out that the mainpolitical objective of the Republicans was to have an agreed-upon bill on thetable to enable them to use the summer recess to build popular anti-vetopressure on Clinton.            The only real departure from the reporting template comes with theWP's observation that high-tech lobbyists have been working feverishlyfor months to incorporate into the bill its R and D tax credit, a feature thepaper calls a "particularly glittering prize." The paper notes that the Siliconartists have included a former aide to Dick Armey and the brother of the WhiteHouse chief of staff.            A WSJ front-page feature notes that even without such new wrinkles,the tax code allows many corporations to legally pay little or no federal income tax. Morethan half the nation's corporations, says the Journal , quoting a GAOstudy, paid no federal income tax at all between 1989 and 1995. And in 1998,says the paper, General Motors managed to get itself in the 0.8 percent taxbracket. (This story is a dramatic reminder of the difference between theJournal's news and editorial pages.)            The WP and LAT front a fresh study from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, appearing in today's JAMA , with acounterintuitive result: a significant decline in high-school violence in the1990s. One possible explanation of the disconnect that the stories don'taddress: that the study ends with data from 1997, and 1998 and 1999 have beenmarked by some major school shootings.            Another JAMA study, written up at the WP and NYT ,calculates that the cost of treating the nation's gunshot wounds for a recentyear, 1994, was $2.3 billion. Half of that cost, says the study, was ultimatelyborne by the government. The average cost of a gunshot wound that requires ahospital visit is $14,600 for emergency care and $35,400 for lifetime follow-upcare.            The NYT , LAT , and USAT front, and the WP stuffs,word that an arbitration panel has ruled that the government must pay the heirsof Abraham Zapruder $16 million for the movie he shot of the Kennedyassassination. The Zapruder family had been asking for $30 million and thegovernment had been offering $1 million.            The NYT runs a Reuters dispatch noting Mattel's announcement that itwill be licensing Barbie and Hot Wheels to a computer manufacturer. The Barbiecomputers will be silver with pink and purple floral accents and will come witha Barbie Digital Camera and a flowered Barbie mouse. The Hot Wheels model willfeature the toy's flame logo and a steering wheel.            The lead editorial at the LAT reminds that it's been almost six yearssince Newt Gingrich promised to post all congressional proceedings on theInternet and almost four since the passage of the Electronic Freedom ofInformation Act, which required all federal agencies to grant Americans promptaccess to relevant information in their databases. The paper observes that mostbranches of the U.S. government stand in violation of the Act. The SupremeCourt of Mongolia has a Web site, says the LAT , but the U.S. SupremeCourt does not.
