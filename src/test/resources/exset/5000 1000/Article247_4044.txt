                                 Carpal Diem            Both the New York Times andWashington Post lead with the government's expectedintroduction today of safety rules designed to counter repetitive stressinjuries in the workplace, like carpal tunnel syndrome. The USA Todaylead notes how states will be spending the first installment of the $206billion they'll receive in settlements with the tobacco industry. Most of theinitial $2.4 billion, the paper reports, will be going to health care, but muchwill also be spent on completely unrelated areas, such as roads, jails, farmaid, schools, and senior centers. The story quotes the architect of state legalaction against tobacco companies, Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore,as deploring this diversion of funds. The Los AngelesTimes leads with a snapshot of the nation's current politicalsentiment, based on 1,800 adults (including 370 who aren't registered tovote--who cares what they think?). The polling's takeaway: Voters would preferDemocrats controlling Congress and a Republican in the White House (thesurvey's presidential tally is Bush over Gore 55 percent to 40 percent), astance the paper summarizes as "Times are good, so throw the bums out."            The big type over the WP lead--"OSHA OFFERS STANDARD TO FIGHTINJURIES IN WORKPLACE"--is clearer than the big type over theNYT 's--"AFTER LONG DELAY, U.S PLANS TO ISSUE ERGONOMIC RULES." But withthat exception, the NYT effort is the better story. For instance, what does the WP mean with this firstsentence, "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration will take thefirst step today to require many employers to provide work spaces and equipmentto support the physical makeup of each individual doing his job."? And theNYT uses its third paragraph to cite bottom-line-based businessresistance to the rules as the chief cause in their delay, while thePost doesn't get to this until its 13th. And while the WP quotessomebody from something called Food Distributors International as its sourcefor the bottom-line worry, the Times goes instead with the SmallBusiness Administration, which the paper explains, is an independent governmentagency.            Moreover, the Times has the clearest statement of the dimension ofthe problem being addressed: 600,000 Americans injured this way on the job eachyear. (A puzzle arising from reading the stories together: Although theWP doesn't give the injury total, it says the new regime would prevent300,000 injuries. Can it really be true that fully half of these injuries areunpreventable?)            The LAT is alone in fronting the news that according to the FBI,serious crime continues to plummet--10 percent in the first half of 1999. The storymakes the point that the falling crime rate helps police fight crime: lightercaseloads mean more cops on the street.            The NYT front reports that a class action lawsuit will be filed todayon behalf of millions of Californians claiming that Microsoft used its monopolyon operating systems to overcharge for Windows 95 and Windows 98. The papersays that this sort of lawsuit could ultimately be more of a threat to thecompany than suits brought by competitors, potentially costing it millions,even billions.            George W. Bush gave a live interview on TV yesterday (on Meet thePress ) and what is most important about what he said depends on whichpaper you read. The WP emphasizes his praise for what the paper callsthe "Supreme Court's two most consistently conservative and antiabortionjurists," while refusing to say what he thought about Justice David H. Souter.The NYT starts off with Bush's profession of opposition to mostabortions but then immediately cites his remark that in his presidency ananti-abortion stance would not be the principal consideration for appointmentto the Supreme Court. The Wall Street Journal leads instead with GWB's statement ofhis commitment to an overhaul of the Social Security system. The Journalstory doesn't mention abortion.            The WP passes along the results of a New York Post online pollsoliciting readers' opinions about the most evil people of all time: BillClinton finished second (voters had to write him in), after Adolf Hitler butahead of Stalin, Pol Pot, and Josef Mengele. Hillary Clinton, also a write-in,finished sixth.            Evidence of just how overpaid college coaches are at even "legitimate"programs can be garnered from this straight-faced item in the real estatesection of Sunday's LAT : "UCLA basketball coach Steve Lavin haspurchased a newly built custom home in Marina del Rey for close to its $1.5million asking price."
