Randy'sWrap-Up                        Given: News Quizparticipants respond with particular enthusiasm to questions about the SupremeCourt. Given: The law is a particularly unhappy profession. That is, aremarkably high percentage of lawyers are discontent with their jobs.Therefore: Most News Quiz participants are lawyers who take out theirfrustrations on a poor Supreme Court justice just because he is a coldhearted,reactionary bastard with dubious views about race and little understanding ofAmerican life. I have no legal training, but isn't there some kind of logicalerror in this paragraph? Because, aside from the dubious propositions, theunsupported assumptions, and the illogical conclusion, I can't figure out whereI went wrong--just like Justice Scalia.                           Courtly LoveAnswer                        Justice Scalia waved his glasses.            The court was hearing the first of three cases thatseek to define disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, inparticular, whether the act applies to a person who can restore normalfunctioning by, for example, taking medication or wearing glasses. And it's asneat a Catch-22 as you're ever going to see, even through those disposablecontact lenses. In one case, American Airlines declined to hire two workersbased on their uncorrected vision--i.e., glasses off--but argued that the womencouldn't sue because with their vision corrected--i.e., glasses on--they arenot disabled.            If the court goes withthe broadest possible definition, most Americans would be considered disabled,ill-mannered, and unattractively dressed, and would rarely be asked out bypeople from more stylish countries. If the court goes with the broadestdefinition actually under consideration, most Americans could indeed beconsidered disabled, but their attractiveness wouldn't be relevant. I blame thesystem.                           Greg Diamond's Lifein These United States Extra                        This is apropos ofnothing, but I've noticed an Internet ad for Bell South using the slogan "TheReal White Pages." Is it a good idea nowadays for any Southern institution togo around proclaiming itself as "real white"?                           Kate Wing'sAmerican Wonderland Extra                        Driving through TedTurner's bison ranch out near Big Sky (there's an easement through the propertyso you can get to a state park on the other side), I saw one of my favoritewarning signs ever. It reads, approximately:                           Warning! Bison have sharp horns!They can run faster than you!They are not tame! Do not attemptto pet the bison!                                       CommonDenominators                        Scalia as regressive; balls as metaphor; ClarenceThomas as ventriloquist's dummy.
