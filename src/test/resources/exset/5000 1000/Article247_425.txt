                                 Would You Like Some More Coffees?                           USAToday and the New YorkTimes lead with the continuing furor over the White House coffeevideos. The top story at the Washington Post is a major espionage arrest. And thenational lead at the Los Angeles Times is the awarding of the Nobel Prize inMedicine.            What's driving the White House videos story forward is the news (firstreported by the WP yesterday) that the White House is now admittingthere are still more coffee tapes. USAT reports that campaign financehearing chairman Sen. Fred Thompson calls this episode a deliberate effort to"delay and obstruct." The paper quotes White House spokesman Lanny Davis assaying the omission was "an honest overlooking of materials." And, saysUSAT , the White House couldn't reach anyone at the Justice Department onThursday to discuss the tape issue because it was a Jewish holiday. TheNYT has this explanation as well. (Question: Is Janet Reno Orthodox oris she merely Reform and hence could have lifted the receiver if she'd beencalled at home?)            The NYT tapes story runs next to a picture from one of the videosshowing President Clinton with a bunch of unidentified people, presumably fatcats. Question: If, as we're told, these films were shot by the military officein charge of archiving such White House events, wouldn't those names berecorded somewhere? And if so, isn't not making them available along with thevideotapes a clear case of stonewalling?            The Post spy story, which also is on the front at USAT ,departs somewhat from the pattern of recent espionage cases. For one thing, thethree accused of long-term spying for East Germany are said by the FBI to haveacted out of ideological rather than material motives. For another, one of thering members had once held a somewhat high-level Pentagon job (and even, saysthe WP , applied for a White House job.) The papers' headlines reflectthese two strands of the story. USAT : "Pentagon Attorney Among ThoseArrested on Espionage Charges." WP : "Onetime Campus Radicals Held in SpyCase." Both will get plenty of attention in the days ahead.            The LAT continues to work a Clinton fund-raising scandal it broke andstill has all to itself: the news that a 1991 10-day Asian trip taken bythen-DNC chairman Ron Brown was designed to raise funds for the DNC fromforeign lobbyists and investors. Today's story focuses on a memo written toBrown by a party aide pitching the trip, which contains such tidbits as that"John Huang has offered to host an event in Hong King with a goal of $50,000,"and "if we take the trip as proposed, we will raise at least $100,000."            The Wall Street Journal reports that attorneys general fromthree states-California, New York, and Connecticut have joined the antitrustprobe into Microsoft already occupying Massachusetts and Texas. The paperreports that the focus of the investigation is whether Microsoft is trying toprevent personal computer manufacturers from shipping new machines loaded withthe Windows operating system from also being factory loaded with any non-MSInternet browser. State law officials have become emboldened in the matter, theJournal says, by the recent 40-state tobacco settlement.            The NYT front reports that Benjamin Netanyahu has put up a defiantdefense of the Israeli assassination attempt against a Hamas leader, saying, "Itake the responsibility on myself." There's also a NYT editorial todaycalling for Israeli to foreswear assassination as a policy tool. Butresponsibility was the last thing Netanyahu was hoping to take, and his goalwas far more than assassination. The Hamas leader was not shot (and the agentswere close enough to have done that) nor taken to Israel to stand trial.Instead the plan was for the target to get sick and die when the Israelis werelong gone. None of the papers seem to have noticed that what Netanyahu wantedwas the result without the responsibility.                           Some conditions improved immediately. According to the WSJ ,Former Labor Secretary Lynn Martin, hired by Mitsubishi to improve plantconditions for women, says in a deposition that she is being paid $2.2 millionfor her work.
