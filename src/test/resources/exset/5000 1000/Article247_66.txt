                                 Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime            There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC's ThisWeek this morning, furrow-browed and "heartbroken with all the evidencecoming out" against the president. Last week, when the Lewinsky story was onlya few hours old, Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America todemonstrate his concern. "These are probably the most serious allegations yetleveled against the president. There's no question that, if they're true, they... could lead to impeachment proceedings."            Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and evendisgusting about Stephanopoulos' eager show of independence from the president?The problem isn't so much his disloyalty. Political figures turn on each otherfrom time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it. Stephanopouloswants to run for the Senate and doesn't want to seem a Clinton stooge. Bylending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiardefenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he'snot a fool.            The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies inthe first place. During the 1992 campaign, when Gennifer Flowers first broughtClinton's philandering to public attention, Stephanopoulos--as Clinton's chiefspinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role indiscrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namelythat Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem. (Don't say Stephanopoulos didn'tknow. Again, he's not a fool.) Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as anyman to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments.            The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts ontape. Early in the film, with the Flowers crisis in full bloom, Sam Donaldsoninterviews Stephanopoulos, who blames it all on the "Republican attackmachine." "Gov. Clinton has no character problem," Stephanopoulos declares.Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted toinfidelity. "He said he had problems in his marriage," says Stephanopoulos,correcting Donaldson's deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of the day.(Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admittedinfidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simplydidn't care.)            Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someonewho apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about topublicize. Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keepingquiet. "You would be laughed at ..." he tells the caller. "I guarantee you thatif you do this you'll never work in Democratic politics again. ... Nobody willbelieve you and people will think you're scum."            You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protectiontechniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability tonot get caught. He was one of Clinton's principal enablers, to use a wordemployed by Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times . When Democratswonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look muchfurther than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (anda cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992.            Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst.It's as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid-'50s to soberly rue thedamage wreaked by Sen. Joe McCarthy, without any apology for his own role. Muchhas been made of the way famous wrongdoers (e.g.: Dick Morris, Marv Albert)rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture. But usually at least a nanosecondof contrition is required. Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even goingthrough the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading thecountry. If Clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting toexplode, then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House andmuffled the ticking.
