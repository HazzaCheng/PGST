                                 Radioactive Russian Rifles            The New York Timesleads with Russian saber rattling against Chechnya, a story run inside by theWashingtonPost . The WP leads with the widening of a probe into U.S.Embassy officials in Colombia, who are suspected of smuggling drugs to the U.S.through the embassy's mail system. The Los Angeles Times , continuing its extensive follow-upon Tuesday's shooting at a Jewish day-care center, leads with an interview ofthe LAPD chief, who says that all assault rifles and some types of handgunsshould be banned nationwide, collected, and destroyed.            Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin threatened to launch airstrikesagainst the Islamic government in Chechnya, which he accuses of supporting theweek-old invasion of Dagestan by Chechen Islamic commandos. In a tactfuldemurral, the Chechen government denied supporting the rebels and then promisedto make invading "Russian helicopters drop from the sky like rain." Putin saidthat Russian forces were advancing on the Dagestan rebels and that if necessaryRussia will follow the guerrillas into Chechnya, which in 1996 humiliated theRussian military and gained de-facto independence. A Post story--runon Page A13--notes that Putin has yet to be confirmed by parliament, and itquotes a Russian military analyst proclaiming in the Moscow Times that"Russia can blow out the lights in London and Washington and yet has failedtime and again to contain relatively small bands of Chechen fighters on itsterritory."            The LAT reports that Washington state corrections officials arereviewing the conduct of Buford Furrow's probation officer, who never madeunannounced checks of Furrow's house and car for weapons. This despite Furrow'sfrequent claims that he was homicidal and suicidal, and despite a judge's orderthat he stay away from deadly weapons.            The LAT also tracks how one of Furrow's guns--the 9mm Glocksemiautomatic pistol he used to shoot a mailman--made it into his hands. Thepistol, which was originally sold to a small police department near Tacoma,Wash., had at least five owners before Furrow. A year ago, Furrow sold two ofhis guns--the Glock and a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle found in his van--to apawn shop and later bought them back. The LAT quotes the pawn shopowner saying that had the transaction taken place several months later, hecould have used a new Brady law provision to prevent their resale. This seemsslightly reassuring, but the same Times article reports that Furrowhad six other handguns and rifles in his van besides the two he sold to andbought from the pawnshop.            The NYT fronts an investigation into whether Washington statemental-health workers should have forcibly institutionalized Furrow.Apparently, Furrow's was a borderline case: He had slashed his wrists, tried tostab workers at a mental health facility, and constantly talked about hisviolent, racist fantasies; on the other hand, he had had only one run-in withthe law, had sought psychiatric care, held a degree in engineering, and hadheld numerous jobs, including one at the Boeing Co. Mental-health expertsquoted in the story argue that Furrow's case is not nearly as clear-cut as thecases against the Capitol-building gunman or the recent New York City subwaypusher.            The NYT fronts a story noting the rise of revisionist historytextbooks in Israeli schools. The books do away with Israel's patriotic,"David-vs.-Goliath" myths in favor of a broader perspective. For example, thenew books say that it was Israel, not the Arab states, which held the militaryadvantage in the 1948 war for independence, and that Palestinians left theirland not because they smugly assumed Israel would lose the war but because theywere afraid or forced out by Israeli soldiers. The books use the politicallyverboten term Palestinian , as well as the Arab word for the1948 war--the Naqba , or catastrophe.            The Post reports that experts at a uranium plant in Kentuckybelieve that while dismantling nuclear missiles, radioactive gold, lead,aluminum, and nickel were melted into ingots and sold to the private sector.This resulted from a far-sighted 1950s Energy Department program to recyclescrap metal from nuclear weapons facilities into forms that could be used inhousehold products, jewelry, and even children's braces.
