                                 Take That, You IMFers                           USAToday and the Los Angeles Times lead with the continuing Iraq crisis. TheNew York Timesleads with the House's vote to defeat President Clinton's plan to pay off theU.S. debt to the U.N. and to make extra contributions to the IMF. The Washington Post leads with the news that the FBI overlookedevidence it had collected of China's attempts to influence domesticpolitics.            What happened in Iraq is that Saddam Hussein ousted the six Americans on theU.N. weapons inspection team, and the team's leader responded by pulling nearlyall of his multi-national team out of the country. The LAT headline isabout the ouster, the USAT headline is about the pull-out.            The NYT lead is about how Newt Gingrich struck the UN and IMFfundings from a bill to hold them hostage until conservative members can getprogress on an unrelated issue--tightening further the current rules againstabortion-related uses of federal money. The Times points out that thisnon-action could hamstring U.S. efforts to forge a strong U.N. agreement onaction against Iraq, and could hurt the IMF's attempts to contain the Asianeconomic crisis. Clinton press spokesman Mike McCurry is quoted in theNYT and WP (which carries the story inside) as calling thecongressional action "boneheaded."            The Post lead is another water molecule in Bob Woodward's drip-dripcampaign against the Dept. of Justice's campaign fund-raising investigation.Today's installment is that the FBI has admitted overlooking evidence aboutChina's domestic political lobbying until the Thompson hearings had alreadyshut down. The evidence even includes, says the WP , indications that theChinese CIA boasted that it had thwarted the congressional inquiry.            The story reports that Janet Reno was "livid" when she learned of the FBIfoul-up. Note that this has become an essential politico-journalistic routine:a political figure's organization screws up and the press reports how angryhe/she was about it. Other recent examples include the alleged off-cameratantrums had by Bill Clinton and Janet Reno over the belated discovery of thecoffee videos, and yesterday's report about how somebody high up in the WhiteHouse nearly throttled an ATF agent over the discovery that ATF was lettingscads of assault weapons into the country.            The WP says that according to a Justice Department survey releasedyesterday, more than one million women are stalked every year in the U.S. Soare, the study says, 370,000 men.            The NYT , LAT , and WP each report that new studies ofthe breakthrough triple therapies for AIDS indicate that the regimen doesn'teliminate HIV, but tends to make it dormant, which means that the therapiesshould be continued even when patients are completely asymptomatic.            An op-ed in the NYT by former CIA director Robert Gates calls for astrong military response to Saddam Hussein, not just a few cruise missiles.This comes on the heels of similar calls from the keyboards of the NYT 'sThomas Friedman and the WP 's Richard Cohen.            This column is sentencing itself to the Department of Corrections forseveral offenses committed yesterday. First, since Pakistanis aren't Arabs,yesterday's lead should not have spoken of the dominance of the day's news byArab terrorists. Second, it turns out that while the 11/12 national edition ofthe NYT didn't report the Pakistani shootings and the first part of themetropolitan press run didn't either, the story did make it into the latterhalf of the metro edition. Similarly, although early copies of the 11/13Times didn't have the FBI's drawdown of the TWA 800 investigation on thefront page, most of the press run did.                           Hmmm...most guys want it on the outside. Today's Wall Street Journal says that "Merck's Propecia iseffective in restoring hair in some people, a U.S. Food and Drug Administrationpanel found...."
