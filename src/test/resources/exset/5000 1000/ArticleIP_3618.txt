                                 Style Lab            One of my favorite thingsabout New York City is the way businesses huddle together. The diamond dealersare all on 47 th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues. Brazilianrestaurants are on 45 th and 46 th . If you want a guitar,new or used, you need to go to 48 th Street. Furs are in the high 20soff Seventh Avenue; sewing machines are on West 25 th . Some of thesedistricts are ancient, but new commercial clusters are emerging all the time.At the moment, one of the most pleasing is a little neighborhood a few blockseast of the once superfashionable neighborhood of SoHo. In a dozen shops onElizabeth, Mott, and Prince streets, the common thread is style--and anapproach to it that I find very appealing.            A fewyears ago, this neighborhood was a no man's land. Bordered on the east by NewYork's fabled skid row, the Bowery, and on the south by Little Italy, it stillhas something of the flavor of a faded ethnic neighborhood, with Italianbutchers and windowless social clubs and old people sitting out on card chairson the sidewalk. But lately the tone has been set by a group of small clothingstores that share an amorphous design sensibility. What's ordinarily sounappealing about "fashion" is its combination of snobbery, high cost, andhumorlessness. What's wonderful about these places is that they are just theopposite: unsnooty, relatively inexpensive, and fun. Many are presided over byrecent graduates of the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Parsons andRhode Island schools of design who are going into business for the first time.They all have a work-in-progress, school-project attitude. Most don't openuntil 1 o'clock, if then, and they close whenever people stop coming in. Onnice afternoons, friends drop in on their bicycles to say hello and examine thegoods. In several of the stores, the owners apologized for not having theirfall collections finished--after Labor Day. There's an 11-p.m.-at-Kinko'sfeeling to the enterprise.            Nevertheless, NoLIta, as the area is disagreeably called(the abbreviation stands for North of Little Italy), has become a styleincubator for the rest of the city, which means for the country, which meansfor the world. The neighborhood is a favorite scouting territory for designersand buyers for larger-scale style setters such as Calvin Klein, as well as fornational chains such as J. Crew, Urban Outfitters, and the Gap, who come totroll for inspiration (to put it charitably). These chains, many of which haveelegant flagship stores in nearby SoHo, do with clothes what Target and IKEA dowith furniture and household objects--they disseminate an affordable version ofurban chic to the middle class. In the new ecology of downtown New York,stylistic innovation of various kinds is most likely to take place to the eastof Lafayette Street, in NoLIta or the East Village or on the Lower East Side.To the west of Lafayette, in SoHo, those styles are marked up and sold to theunknowing. In some cases, the mass-made interpretations are direct rip-offsfrom small independent designers, who don't seem to mind. For the most part,they take plagiarism as flattery. At this stage in their careers, thevalidation they get from seeing their stylistic ideas catch on is moreimportant than credit or royalties.            Part ofwhat's appealing about these places is that the idea of style they embody isholistic. All the details of the store convey an aesthetic: the lettering onthe window, the paper stock used for business cards, the lighting, the floor,the ceiling, the display racks. The stores are designed by people who payattention to how everything looks. But they manage to do so, in the main,without seeming precious or prissy about it.
