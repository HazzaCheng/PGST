                                 America's Bitchiest Debates                        Hmmm. I see a way to kill two birds with one stone here. UPN recently,imprudently, trimmed the word "McNasty" from the title of ShastaMcNasty , rendering it a naked Shasta . Here's a way for them to boosttheir ratings, repair their grievous show-naming error, and still save face:"Gore/Bradley McNasty Smackdown!" I'd watch.            Actually, your point about the taunting in presidential debates brings up aninteresting point: There have never been any presidential candidates possessedof great wit. Or even medium wit. Even the best moments from presidentialdebates, like Reagan's "I paid for this microphone," were transparentlyscripted well in advance. More often, the candidates throw around cannedinsults that were a) written by ghostwriters; and (b) aren't very good. Thebest example of this that comes to mind is the clumsy taunt aimed at Dukakis:"Governor, that answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor." Ooooooh. Theclosest we've come to a great moment of unpremeditated nastiness during adebate was Lloyd Bentsen's "You're no Jack Kennedy" line, and that has at leastthree caveats: First, it was during a vice-presidential debate. Second, I'mguessing that it probably was scripted well in advance, but at least Bentsenhad the ability to make it appear off-the-cuff. And finally, it was used onQuayle, which is sort of like using a sledgehammer on a drugged baby seal.            I know that there are those who say politics have become too nasty andpersonalized, that debates should be thoughtful discussions of policy issues.And, ideally, I suppose that would be the case. But it isn't. Instead, what wetend to get are safe, silly bromides--"I believe America's best days are aheadof us," the candidates say, waiting for their opponents to jump up and scream,"Liar!"--mixed in with ad hominem attacks. So, these being the state ofaffairs, couldn't the debates at least be amusing? Couldn't we get some acescript doctors in there to write bitchy, scathing lines for our candidates? AreElaine May and Paul Rudnick really too busy to come up with bon mots for JohnMcCain?                           George Bush: "... and finally, I'd support a massive tax cut for the middleclass, enabling us to continue our proud tradition of freedom in this greatcountry of ours."               John McCain: "I heartily endorse Governor Bush's proposals. They make agreat deal of sense. (Beat.) If you've been smoking crack, that is. Youhaven't, have you George? Lately, I mean? Now, George, I know you probablyweren't paying much attention in college--that was, after all, during yourreckless youth, which lasted until you were, what, 40?--but a basic rule ofeconomics is that you can't spend what you don't have. Or, to put this in termsyou'll understand, you've got a $5 bill, and you're trying to buy a dime bag.Are you following me now? Nod your head yes if you understand me. Goodboy."                        Admit it. You'd be appalled for the country, but you wouldn't be able totake your eyes off the set.            In other news, the New York Post 's "Page Six" reports that a movieproduced by Roger Corman titled Fire in the Amazon has received an NC-17 for a nude scene featuring Sandra Bullock and Craig Sheffer. AmericanPsycho has also received an NC-17, also for a nude scene. Two thoughts:First, when is the MPAA going to begin charging distribution companies extrafor handing out NC-17s? They are, after all, the single surest way for a movieto get reams of advance publicity, and yet the MPAA doesn't make a dime offthem. The cost of taking out an ad proclaiming, "We've got Sandra Bullock in anude scene!"? Hundreds of thousands. The cost of having the MPAA announce it?Practically nil. Seems to me there should be some way for Jack Valenti to makesome change off of this.            The second question is, of course, what Sandra Bullock is doing in a RogerCorman movie. I'm worried about her. Speed 2 , Hope Floats ,Forces of Nature . Now this. Should one of us call her, make sure she'sOK?            Tim
