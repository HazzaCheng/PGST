                                 Partial Court Press            The Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes lead with the Supreme Court's announcement that it willhear cases on abortion rights and gay rights this spring. Specifically, it willreview a judgment overturning Nebraska's ban on late-term abortions, and a NewJersey Supreme Court ruling that the Boy Scouts could not exclude a gay troopleader. The LAT off-leads with the Supreme Court story, and leads withthe ongoing LAPD probe: police officials' request that charges be filed againstthree officers. The charges would be the first in the Rampart corruptioninvestigation. The New YorkTimes                lead focuses on thepartial birth abortion ban and doesn't mention the Boy Scout case. TheNYT and the WP front (and the LAT reefers) Russia'spublication of a new national security doctrine. The new doctrine broadens theconditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons, and describes theWest, for the first time since the Cold War, as a potential threat to Russiansecurity.            All of the papers mention that the Supreme Court won't actually reevaluatethe constitutional status of abortion. Nor will the hearings affect the bans onabortions after "fetal viability" (24 weeks into the pregnancy) currentlypending in many states. Nebraska's Supreme Court rejected the state's banbecause its loose definition of a "partial birth abortion" could apply to manycommon procedures used in early stages of pregnancy, violating a 1992 SupremeCourt ruling against "undue burden" on access to abortion. The WPscrutinizes how the timing of the hearings and rulings will affect thepresidential elections. The Court will most likely hear the cases in earlyApril and rule in late June, just as the Campaign 2000 kicks into high gear.This timing should make the Supreme Court a major election issue, as the nextpresident will likely nominate three justices.            The New Jersey case, according to the WP, turns on what sort oforganization the Boy Scouts are. The Scouts say that as a private organization,they have the First Amendment freedom of association to decide who to include,while the court argues that the group's size and tradition of "nonselectivity"renders it a "public association" subject to federal anti-discriminationlaws.            Everyone quotes Russia's change of heart about nukes. In 1997, they would beused "in case of a threat to the existence of the Russian Federation," but inyesterday's revised doctrine they are an option when "all other means ofresolving the crisis have been exhausted." It could have been worse: someRussian officials had argued for a policy that included an "early first use"option. The NYT also reminds us that U.S. doctrine is traditionallymore hawkish on the use of nuclear weapons, but no one mentions what today'sU.S. policy actually is. Analysts agree that the added chilliness towards NATOis a result of the Kosovo crisis and more recent criticism of the Chechencampaign by NATO members.            A U.N. tribunal found five ethnic Croats guilty of "persecution" and crimesagainst humanity for their role in ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The decision isgroundbreaking because it is the first to declare ethnic cleansing a crimeagainst humanity. For their roles in a 1993 massacre that ended with over 100Muslims dead, the convicts could spend up to 25 years in prison.            The NYT front notes that South Korea plans to spend around $1billion over the next five years to build a rocket capable of launchingsatellites. US analysts fear that the plan is economically unfeasible, anddeleterious to the stability of the region: South Korea could export thetechnology to countries who would use it to launch weapons, and fears thatSouth Korea might use the rocket to deploy their own weapons could set off anarms race in northeast Asia. The WP continues to mine the aftershocksof the AOL Time Warner merger, saying the incident has revived European anxietyabout technological inferiority: Europeans are far less likely than Americansto be wired, and e-commerce revenues in the 15 EU nations are only a third ofwhat they are in the U.S. The story blames the gap on government subsidies offailing industries (to save jobs) and a greater cultural aversion to risk.             In a NYT op-ed, author and dog lover Caroline Knapp fans theflames of New York's dog wars, lambasting snobbish humans who only wantproperly sized, pedigreed dogs in their co-ops. Unlike many of these whinyelitists, she says, the dog is "a noble and sensitive creature who, givenproper care, may make a far better tenant than many humans." Maybe so, but atleast we're housebroken.
