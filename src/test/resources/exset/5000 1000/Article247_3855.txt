                                 Lingua Europa                        Good morning, Jesse:            The language front has been unusually quiet today: The only news I see isthe European Union announcement (reported on the CNN Web site) that the year2000 will be the year of language. The EU is urging everyone to learn at leasttwo languages, arguing that bilingualism will better prepare workers for theinternational economy. I'm surprised no one is arguing for an internationalEuropean language to match the uniform currency. In fact, the EU is strugglingwith language issues, having authorized a set of official languages and havinggone on record as supporting a variety of local languages as well. I assume theEU regards an interlanguage as a crackpot idea; although there must be anEsperantist or two out there who will come forward to defend the idea, createdlanguages are difficult to spread. Quite a few universal languages have beeninvented over the past few centuries, and a couple, like Esperanto, havededicated users even today (Esperanto serves as an auxiliary language--it's noone's native tongue). But even if we had a universal language, it would soonbegin to break up into minority tongues. Babel myth notwithstanding, it's quitepossible that multilingualism has always been part of the human condition.            The European Union may value multilingualism as an economic asset, butAmericans seem to think monolingualism is the way to go. We have a long historyof encouraging non-English speakers living or settling in the United States togive up their first language. Then we turn around and make them take a"foreign" language in high school! I've seen it argued that the languagesimmigrants give up are not useful ones, or ones with literary cultures worthpreserving. In the early part of the 20 th century, psychologistsargued that multilingualism was actually a cause of mental retardation. Evenmore thoughtful educators claimed that immigrants should give up their languagefor English because children didn't have room in their heads for more than onelanguage.            For a variety of reasons, language has come to stand in for other issues: Itcan mask xenophobia, signal patriotism, or reveal membership in an elite or astigmatized group. One reader asks why we don't discuss how politicians andadvertisers twist language to get across their point of view or sell theirproduct. But in a larger sense, that is exactly what all of us do when we uselanguage. All words have spin: There is no strictly neutral or value-free wayof saying anything. It bothers most of us that not all language use is fair orethical, that it may be deceptive or an outright lie, or what we perceive as amistake or usage error. But lying, deception, and lack of ethics, not tomention real and imagined mistakes, much as we may deplore them, are naturalhuman--and linguistic--phenomena. We can try to get people to change theirlanguage use, to make them more precise, to make them more honest, but itdoesn't help to blame the language for failings we perceive in languageusers.            In fact, there are many times when language should not be precise, or evenhonest. Think about linguistic behavior at funerals, for example. There arelots of times in our social interactions when if we told the truth, or spokeprecisely rather than in a more circumspect fashion, we would find ourselvesnot socially interacting any more--in other words we'd get everyone so madthey'd avoid us altogether. This too may be a goal of some language users--toanger our interlocutors may be useful, even unavoidable.            Will there be a universal language? I don't think so. Will everyone becomebilingual? No. Will bureaucrats ever learn to write clearly? Don't get mestarted! But none of those things is my ultimate goal. What I hope people willdo is what we're doing here--airing issues, exploring them critically,interrogating our own preconceptions about language, broadening ourunderstanding about how we use language and how we'd like it to be used.
