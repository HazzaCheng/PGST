                                 Explaining Today's Papers                        Readers have requested explanations of some of the terms used in                  Slate's "Today's Papers" column. Here is a briefglossary.                           Above-the-fold : On the top half of the front page (therefore visibleeven before the newspaper is unfolded). Signifies one of the most importantstories of the day, according to that paper's editors.                           Evergreen : An article that could run at any time. There are two typesof evergreens: 1) an article without a direct tie-in to the day's news (e.g.,"Traffic on the Rise in Metro Area"); and 2) a story that recurs regularly(e.g., "Elderly Threatened by Record Heat").                           Front (as a verb): To place a story on the front page. The fivenational newspapers often reach different decisions on which stories to fronton any given day. (See also, above-the-fold .)                           Jump (verb or noun): For a story that begins on one (usually thefront) page, to continue on another page. Or the place in the story where itbreaks between pages. Or the entire part of the story after the first page.Because studies consistently show that few readers follow an article beyond thejump, many papers attempt to lay out the crucial elements of the story beforethe jump. ( USA Today is the most extreme case, with front page newsstories that almost never jump). Thus, the organization of facts around thejump can often reveal a paper's slant on a story.                           Lead : The news story deemed most important by the newspaper. In mostpapers, the lead appears on the front page at the top of the right-hand column.The New York Times is the strictest about this rule, while USAToday --which often runs a feature story across the top of the frontpage--varies the most from this standard. On occasion, the WashingtonPost and Los Angeles Times will displace the lead with a featurestory--usually one with an eye-grabbing visual. In these cases, the lead willalmost always be the next story down in the right-hand column. The WallStreet Journal has not adopted these conventions for leads. Instead, thepaper usually fronts feature stories and an extensive, two-column newssummary.            (Note: The opening sentence or paragraph of a news story is also known asthe lead, but usually spelled "lede" to avoid confusion.)                           Off-lead : The second most important news story of the day. Theoff-lead appears either in the top left corner, or directly below the lead onthe right.                           Op-Ed: The page in a newspaper where opinion pieces notwritten by the paper's editorial board appear. It originally stood for"opposite the editorial page." It also refers to the individual articles on theop-ed page (e.g., "Henry Kissinger's New York Times op-ed on the nucleartest ban treaty"). Some op-ed pieces are written by regularly syndicatedcolumnists, and others are submitted to the newspaper unsolicited.                           Reefer : A brief front-page synopsis of a story that appearsinside the paper. USA Today's "Newsline" and the Wall StreetJournal's "What's News" are essentially multiple reefers. The New YorkTimes , Washington Post , and Los Angeles Times tend tointegrate reefers into their front-page layouts.                           Slug (as a verb): To run under the headline of (e.g., "TheChicago Tribune slugged the story, 'Teen births fall to record low' ").The term originally referred to the pieces of lead which held the type in placeon printing presses.                           Stuff (as a verb): To place a story inside the paper.Slightly derogatory, usually implying that the story was underplayed. (e.g.,"The New York Times and Los Angeles Times fronted the Wacocontroversy, while USA Today stuffed the story").            Next question?
