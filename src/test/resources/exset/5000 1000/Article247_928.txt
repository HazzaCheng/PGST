                                 Crying Wolf            Republican representatives girding themselves for the labor of impeaching apopular president would have had reason to feel proud if they happened to readthe Wall Street                Journal 's opinion page last Friday. There, in anelevated style more common to Roman public address than to newspaperese, wasthe argument for voting one's conscience rather than one's poll numbers:"Greatness and transcendence are why people join political parties, and whythey go to war. It is why they risk and sacrifice, and engage in politicalargument. Ultimately they are moved by principle, and will for its sake throwaside or forgo the material things that scoundrel politicians think they holdabove all else."            The editorial was written by Mark Helprin, the conservatives' answer to ToniMorrison. Helprin is a leading American novelist ( Memoir from AntproofCase , A Soldier of the Great War ) whose great theme is the nobilityof the warrior and his worldview. He is also a member of the Journal 'seditorial board and a cowriter of Bob Dole's famous Senate resignation speech.Helprin has called for Clinton's impeachment since the first days of theLewinsky affair. His arguments have a real resonance (to this reader, anyway),since they go to the heart of the matter, at least as high-school Englishclasses teach us to define it: that a man's character shapes his actions.Citing the long record of the president's "boldness and mendacity"--not justthe Lewinsky case but the Travel Office and FBI file coverups, etc.--Helprincompares the fibbing Clinton to the model of the self-sacrificing statesman:"As others move in the light, he will move in the darkness, so that as othersmove in darkness, he may move in the light. ... A statesman must have atemperament that is suited for the Medal of Honor, in a soul that is unafraidto die."            Helprin, in short, is a militant idealist, the Steven Spielberg of politicalargument. So what are we to make of the discrepancy between Helprin's idealsand his actions? Helprin has an even worse track record than the president whenit comes to stretching the truth so fine it can't be distinguished from a lie.A 1991 profile in the New York Times Magazine (whose accuracy, it shouldbe noted, Helprin has challenged) depicted him as a man who cheerfully admittedthat he couldn't help but spin tall tales, but had learned from hard experiencethe downside of doing so: "In my first radio interview, the announcer said,'Tell me about your life.' So I began telling him about how I was a mercenaryin Africa in a country where I became close to the President. Then there was acoup and I left with sacks of diamonds. I told the story in such a way that itsounded plausible, and the announcer kept on saying: 'You're kidding. I can'tbelieve this. Is this really true?' and I'd say, 'Yes, yes, yes, it's true. Ofcourse, it's true. . . .' "            Among stories the Times writer said Helprin fabricated in hispresence , even after making that admission: that his mother was sold intoslavery; how when he was a teenager he was attacked by a Pakistani immigrant toJamaica and received 60 stitches without anesthesia. (The fact of the attack isprobably true, but, as the Times writer said, the details surrounding ithave changed frequently.) Accounts of Helprin's penchant for amusing orself-aggrandizing exaggeration are legendary in the literary world. Even hisrecent political articles are filled with yarns that make one long for a littlegood old-fashioned fact-checking. Take a story he published this year inForbes ASAP --the tale of how he, a young and lowly private in theIsraeli army just before the Yom Kippur War, understood how unready the armywas for a surprise attack and managed to convey his concerns to Golda Meir andMoshe Dayan. His advice, of course, was tragically ignored.            It would be nave to criticize a fiction writer for fabricating fictions;that's what a novelist does for a living. But what about when the prevaricatorbecomes a political columnist and tries convince politicians to impeach otherpoliticians for prevaricating? As Helprin would surely ask, should a man likethat sit on the editorial board of a major American newspaper?                           --Judith Shulevitz
