Legal Aid seeks to balance scales of justiceTuesday, September 3, 2002Andrew TilghmanFive times more needy people ask for help than staff canassistAlbany In the morning, the phones ring relentlessly at Albany'sLegal Aid office, each call bringing another story of low-incometroubles, legal crisis or bureaucratic confusion.The office usually is so overwhelmed, attorneys who work theresay, that they have to stop taking calls and evaluating new casesfor the day by 10 a.m.The calls come from people like Tina Lavery of Scotia, wife of aself-employed auto mechanic. She called Legal Aid after months ofwrangling with federal bureaucrats who denied her request forfinancial help -- about $6,000 a year -- to provide speech therapyfor her 2-year-old son, who was born with autism."They almost always deny you at first," Lavery said. "You haveto have a lawyer to show them you mean business."Lavery considers herself among the fortunate few whose cases areaccepted by Legal Aid, one of the only places in the Capital Regionthat provides free legal services for civil matters such as custodybattles, landlord-tenant disputes or public assistance appeals.Legal Aid workers say their 13-attorney staff can provide fullservices for only about one in every five people who ask for them,leaving many to fend for themselves.Unlike criminal court, where those accused have a constitutionalright to a taxpayerfunded attorney, people facing civil matterseither have to hire their own lawyer -- often at rates of more than$200 an hour -- or go it alone."There is a whole class of people who don't get in," saidLillian Moy, executive director of the Legal Aid Society ofNortheastern New York. "And for them, the price for losing yourhouse or losing your kids or not getting the income the householdneeds is incredibly significant."In many cases, poor people have to face off alone againstadversaries who have attorneys. In landlord-tenant cases, landlordsare almost always represented, tenants almost never.In the family courts, single parents who can't afford attorneyssometimes have to go up against former spouses who can afford legalrepresentation.Although the courts often try to find court-appointed attorneysto represent those who don't have them, there is no guarantee."Clearly, it's not fair. There is a disparity: People ofeconomic means will generally do better in the judicial system thanthose without economic means," said Thomas Levin, chairman of theNew York State Bar Association's Access to Justice Committee.And the ripple effects can be felt throughout the court system,as judges have to stop and explain basic rules that people withlawyers would already understand."It usually takes longer because you have to sort of nurse thepeople through the process," said Dennis Duggan, an Albany CountyFamily Court judge who said he often sees people handling their owncases.Legal Aid spends about $2 million a year culled from a varietyof state and federal sources.A large portion comes from the interest generated by the state'sescrow accounts that is set aside by law for low-income legalservices. The office serves about 4,500 people a year. About 81percent receive only limited services, such as a singleconsultation, rather than full-time representation.No-cost legal services also are offered to a more limited degreefrom places such as the Women's Bar Association of the CapitalDistrict or student clinics at Albany Law School.But for lawyers who spend most of their time practicing otherareas of the law, pro bono cases concerning aspects of family lawor public assistance can be difficult, Levin said.The vast majority of cases never involve a trial and can betaken care of administratively."It's such a bureaucracy that poor people deal with that a lotof it is just straightening things out," said Anne Erickson,executive director of the Greater Upstate Law Project, whichprovides support services and updated legal information for officeslike Legal Aid.Lavery said the help she got from Legal Aid, and the SocialSecurity benefits it helped her secure, have been invaluable."I honestly believe if it wasn't for them, I never would havegotten it. I'd probably still be fighting," she said.
