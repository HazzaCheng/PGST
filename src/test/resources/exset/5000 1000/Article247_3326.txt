                                 Talked Out                        Hello, Walter:            Inspired by your accolades, I am going to tell the truth. I was wrong lastnight. I hunkered down with Talk only to find it ... bloated and oddlyuncompelling.            Not all of it. I enjoyed Charles Bowden's account of the perils of being ayoung female factory worker in Mexico, safari guide Mark Ross' harrowing ifsentimentally written account of his kidnapping in Uganda by Hutu rebels, andmuch of the front-of-the-book "Conversation" section. But other features seemedpretentious and empty, like a photo spread of male stars and their ponderousquotations. "Celebrity is the pox of success," says Harrison Ford as he givesthe camera his trademark weary stare. Some others have been amply reportedelsewhere--Richard Butler's piece on the emasculation of UNSCOM is his owntelling of material that's appeared in the Washington                Post andthe The New                Yorker , and the Wall                Street               Journal and Fortune got to Lorna Wendt way before Mimi Swartz did(she does, however, have the good grace to acknowledge it). And the magazine'sattempt at edginess seems desperate and strained. I've already seen a millioncheesecake photos of Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore, and despite thedictates of Talk's "Hip List," I am not prepared to believe that scabbyknees are cool.            In her editorial message, Tina Brown writes that she chose the nameTalk because of its "unpretentious brevity." But this is a whale of amagazine, with 13 feature stories, 14 front-of-the-book "Conversation" items(many of which are almost feature-length), plus fashion spreads, celeb pics,book reviews, an astrology page, and more. This doesn't feel like editorialbounty--it's as if Talk is throwing everything to the wall to see whatsticks. I kept looking for a unifying sensibility, for flashes of brilliantTina-osity, for Vanity                Fair's sumptuous glamour or the TheNew                Yorker's pensiveness or wit. I also didn't find a single phraseto stop and admire--or even one that carried the metaphorical oomph of thatterrific milk-carton quote you found in the Times .            Wise of you not to take my bet about the Hillary Clinton profile, Walter.You wouldn't have won. The piece contained no new revelations at all-- unlesswe counted the news that, according to the Northern Irish secretary of state, Hillary is responsible for the region's recent economic boom.            Back to Ron Klain and his stellar sense of wordplay. The Times hasconsistently been printing dishy, embarrassing quotes from Gore-niks about thecampaign's weaknesses (landmarks in this series: President Clinton's worriesabout the veep's electability and Bob Squier's railings against Carter Eskew).And now staffers, clearly upset at his departure, have blurted out a goodbyespeech. This strikes me as just as much a testament to the campaign's poormorale and weak organization as it is to the skill of reporters like Seelye.Hasn't Tony Coelho told everyone to keep their mouths shut? What are we goingto hear next? I worked in the Giuliani administration for a year, and noone spoke to the press. The policy was overly suspicious and vituperative,but it also cultivated a sense of common purpose and team loyalty. Even thoughI'm a journalist now, the former staffer in me wants to hush theblatherers.            No more stabs, Walter. Let's keep talking about money and risk--and let'sagree not to let Mark Barton represent the perils of the Internet economy. Ienjoyed today's Journal story quite a bit more than yesterday's. With(smile) one quibble. The piece argues that Americans are newly eager to embracerisk, and compares risky career moves and aggressive investing to " 'hardadventure' travel, where risk-seekers hack through jungles with machetes orscale the world's highest mountains." Is this really all part of one big Trend?I'd give you my thoughts now, but then we'd never eat lunch ...            Talk soon,Jodi            P.S.: Ryan Papir, one of our readers, helpfully told me that after losingabout $4 million in the 1987 crash, a man named Arthur Kane killed a MerrillLynch office manager and seriously injured a stockbroker.
