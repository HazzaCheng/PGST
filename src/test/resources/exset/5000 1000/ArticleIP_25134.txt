                                                            ValidLicense                        As a Berkeley resident who still insists he's aChicagoan, it's nice to see a Royko remembrance (see ""). But one point thatWeisberg raises about Slats Grobnik and Royko's occasional fictionalizing andwhether readers understood it bothers me. It doesn't give enough credit toreaders, for one thing, and it neglects the implicit bargain columnists strikewith their audiences to be on the level.            It seems like everyone I knew who read hiscolumn--and that's nearly everyone I knew growing up, even in thesuburbs--understood that Slats and others were inventions. And everyone, Ithought, knew the difference between the columns in which Royko would create asituation to make a broad point and the columns in which he was talking aboutflesh-and-blood people and life-and-death matters. When he got someone real onthe spit, you could smell it.            One of the bigdifferences between Royko on one hand and Mike Barnicle and similar truants onthe other is that Royko himself didn't confuse his fictions with reality, andhe didn't promote confusion about them. Whatever license he had was earned overa long, long time by drawing a clear line between his creations and hisjournalism, and by scrupulously honoring an unarticulated deal with his readersthat he wouldn't lose track of which was which, so they wouldn't, either.            -- Dan Brekke                        Berkeley, Calif.                           BrooksBrothers                        In his "Assessment" of ,A. O. Scott says the success of The Simpsons "resulted from the unlikelycollusion between Groening ... and Rupert Murdoch." Not really. The realcreative story is the collusion between Groening and James L. Brooks, formerMary Tyler Moore Show staffer and creator of flicks such as BroadcastNews and Ordinary People . Brooks (and his protg, Sam Simon)brought with him the story discipline that made The Simpsons such greattelevision. (For the first few years all three men shared the "created by"credit, but that has since changed.) The staff of talented, bitter ex-IvyLeague writers, led for years by Conan O'Brien, is responsible for the show'slasting greatness. Groening's a genius and all that, but any moving picture isa collaboration, especially in weekly comedy TV. Writers covering televison andmovies should tell their readers that the auteur theory isn't really relevant,especially when a new episode (complete with perfect three-act storystructure!) needs to be cranked out once a week.            -- Ben Swett                        SantaMonica, Calif.                           Lack ofResolution                        To Michael Kinsley'son-the-mark "" about linguistic dodges served up by "thoughtful" commentatorson the conflict in Kosovo, let me contribute the following, perhaps thegrandest of them all--the congressional resolution of "support for our troops."I've never been on the receiving end of such support but, at the risk ofappearing ungrateful, I would probably rather know whether Congress alsohappened to support the mission I was being asked to risk my life for.            -- J.B. Howard                        Baltimore                           AffirmativeReply                        I read Jacob Weisberg's that J.C. Watts Jr. attackedas racist. I'm no fan of Watts. I think you are right that the Republicansplace him in the forefront because he's black. The party is trying to appearinclusive when it really is not. However, to say that is his position is aresult of affirmative action is offensive. Your premise that affirmative actionpromotes or gives positions to people of color who don't deserve or areunqualified for these positions is what I find racist.            It's the promulgation of ideas and derogatorycomments such as yours that debases affirmative action, and misleads andmisinforms people about affirmative action policies. Affirmative action is justthat--affirmative. It gives people who are qualified and knowledgeable anopportunity to display their skills. It opens doors that might have otherwisebeen left closed because of race. It promotes the inherent value of diversityin any given organization or business.            Call J.C. Watts Jr. afront man, or say that he's being prostituted, or whatever. But don't say he'sa result of affirmative action.            -- Karen Archia                        Carrboro, N.C.
