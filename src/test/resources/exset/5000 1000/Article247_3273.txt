                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        Rather perplexing that on a day when Lord Greenspan spooked the bond marketwith talk of a possible--though still only possible--rate hike, bank stockswere doing so well. (If inflation and interest rates are on the way up, that'susually a bad thing for banks.) On the other hand, maybe it's not soperplexing, just an indication that bond traders and stock traders aren'thearing the same news, believing the same things, or expecting the same future.Of course, most stock traders apparently were hearing the same newstoday, as tech stocks got battered again.            What an odd week. The earnings numbers could not have been better. With therare exception, just about every tech bellwether that's reported has come inahead of expectations, and those were expectations that were about as high asany reasonable person could put them. But, again with the rare exception, allthese bellwethers have seen their stock prices get crunched. This only goes toshow you one thing, which happens to be the most important thing to know aboutinvesting: Trying to game the market in the short-term is the definition offoolishness. Dump your money into an index fund, and you won't have to worryabout any of these anxieties disrupting your weekend barbecues. And so, chaton. (By the way, this will be the last weekend chatter for a couple of weeks,since                   Slate               's running a short schedule next week. But we willreturn.)            1. "Sometimes, apparently, the Wall Street Journal forgets itself.Consider this description of a small Christian sect: 'Bruderhofs livecommunally and don't engage in violence, private-property ownership orgossip .' I can just see it now. 'Jack's a brawler and he's always talkingbehind people's backs. But he doesn't own any property, so at least he's gotthat going for him.'"            2. "Online music retailer ... no, that's not exactly right. Online musicdigitizer ... no . Online music something MP3.com went public to muchanticipation Wednesday, and saw its shares leap from $28 to $105 in a matter ofminutes. Of course, the stock is now down around $61. So you can say thatMP3.com's shares nearly quadrupled on their first day and that they werecut almost in half on their first day. Ain't the Net wonderful?"            3. "Best thing a CEO has said in a long time: Time Warner's GeraldLevin to Daily Variety about possible successors to Bob Daly andTerry Semel, 'All current candidates are speculation and unless you talk tome it's all bullshit .' Of course, you wonder if the reporter then said,'But I am talking to you.'"            4. "At long last, UPS is becoming a public company . Now the next timeUPS workers go on strike, management will have another club to bludgeon themwith. 'Our shareholders demand that we hold the line on part-time labor andwage increases!' Music to my ears."            5. "Despite the fact that Mexican taxpayers are on the hook for $71billion to bail out a host of banks that the Mexican government has beenpropping up for most of this decade, the government continues to insist that nopublic official did anything wrong and that no one should be punished. 'Notone single Mexican lost a peso in their bank accounts,' a spokesman for theFinance Ministry said. Apparently the pesos that taxpayers are sending to thegovernment to bail out the banks don't count."            6. "French oil company Elf Aquitaine made a $51 billion counterbidthis week to acquire competitor TotalFina, which had previously announced ahostile takeover attempt on Elf. 'You see, the problem isn't the merging part,'you can almost hear the Elf executives saying. 'The problem is theus-losing-our-jobs part.'"            7. "From the most recent issue of the Atlantic : 'When they envisiontheir future, Xers don't just see a government drifting toward the politicalequivalent of Chapter 11 ; they also see a crippled social structure, adwindling middle class, and a despoiled natural habitat.' Wow. Who knew thatXers lived in 1974?"
