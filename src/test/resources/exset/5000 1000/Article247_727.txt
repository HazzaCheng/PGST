                                 The House Budges            The House's passage Tuesday night of the $500 billion federal spending billleads at USAT ,the LAT and the WP . The papers report that the Senate is expected toapprove the bill today. The NYT leads with the continuing Mideast talks, stashing thebudget story inside. The Times says the participation by Jordan's KingHussein appears to have created some optimism. The paper also reports twosticking points: 1) the Israelis want to put a specific number ofPalestinians-including some Palestinian Authority cops-on trial for terroristattacks against Israelis, and 2) the Palestinians are insisting that safepassage rights for their people between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip extendto making the trip in private cars, not just mass transportation. All themajors' fronts except the LAT 's report Day 2 of the Microsoft trial, atwhich the company's lawyer made his opening statement, comparing the governmentto 19th century Luddites going around smashing machines with sledgehammers.            The papers all note what a kludge the budget process has become. Forinstance, the NYT points out that the House bill incorporates numerouspolicy decisions that Congress never debated. And they all tick off examples ofits extremities. The LAT , for example, reports that it includeslegislation to carry out the Chemical Weapons Convention (previously passed bythe Senate, but not implemented) as well as a measure to keep the world safefor airborne peanuts. Ritually, everybody but USAT mentions some of thebill's physical dimensions--the WP gives the most stats of this sort:weight=40 pounds, height=16 inches, and the number of pages=3,825. This sort ofthing reeks of press-released pre-packaged "color"-space-consuming andboring.            All the papers mention that Newt Gingrich dismissed critics of the bill asperfectionists. But USAT never explains that it was the G.O.P.'shard-core conservatives who were complaining. The WP does mention this, butit's the LAT and the NYT that play the point high, explainingthat by the conservatives' lights, the bill spends too much and cuts taxes toolittle. The NYT even goes out of its piece saying that the vote revealeda severe split in the Republican Party that may be hard to patch up.            The LAT budget story notes a last-minute deal in which Sen. AlfonseD'Amato won approval of a provision requiring health insurance companies tocover post-mastectomy reconstructive surgery, and explains it this way: D'Amatowas trying to undercut his election opponent's strong support among womenvoters. This is a bit brisk for a news story: Isn't there any chance thatD'Amato is concerned about women not being able to afford reconstructions?            The NYT front and the WSJ front-page business news box report that according tothe latest government figures, the U.S. foreign trade gap for August reachedthe highest level-$16.77 billion-recorded since the present method ofcalculation was adopted in 1992. The Journal says a government analystestimates the deficit is actually now the biggest since December 1985. The twopapers attribute the weak exports and strong imports behind the gap to theglobal economic downturn.            The LAT fronts high a story about the emerging tension between themakers of legal, medical and financial software on the one hand, and lawyers,doctors and investment professionals on the other, as the software nibbles awayat the professionals' traditional turf. The piece reports that in Texas, acommittee of lawyers is trying to ban self-help legal software via a statutebarring anyone--or anything, the paper wryly notes--from practicing law withouta license. One of the attacked programs, Quicken Family Lawyer, features ArthurMiller, who while not a member of the Texas bar, is a professor at Harvard LawSchool.            The paper notes that the power of the Internet will only expand professionalsoftware's reach. An example the LAT gives is the recent spate of websites that facilitate the sale of Viagra to those logging on and filling out aquestionnaire. In telling this story, the paper makes an interesting choice:deciding to publish the web address for one Viagra site. This is tantamount tofree advertising. Does the LAT also intend to start publishing the phonenumbers of lawyers and doctors in stories about them?
