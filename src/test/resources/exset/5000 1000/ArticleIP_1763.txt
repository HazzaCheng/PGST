What the Italian papers call"sexygate" or "sexgate" was back on most of the world's front pages Thursday,offering a promising lifeline for newspapers during the dog days of August.Most papers seemed to think President Clinton would get away with it, though atsome personal cost. "Clinton has changed American customs for ever," saidCorriere dellaSera of Milan. "He has won the right to privacy for his successors. But theprice he has paid has been a spider's web of half-truths and half-silence whichis wearing him away." LaRepubblica of Rome said, "American public opinion has already forgiven Billfor a sin he won't admit to having committed."            In Paris,Le Monde said that ifClinton tried "to fend off the questioning with dodges similar to the one aboutfellatio and penetration, he will founder in ridicule. If he admits to havinglied, he will be found guilty of perjury." But it was still unlikely thatCongress would find enough evidence to bring a charge of impeachment to trial,it said. Die Welt of Germanysaid it was now Monica's word against Bill's, and the paper doubted thatKenneth Starr could make his case against the president stick.            In Britain, the liberal Guardian said Clinton shouldnot be toppled by the affair. The president would be wrong to commit perjuryabout his relations with Lewinsky, "but not perhaps so incredibly andshockingly wrong." It said there was also some irony "in expecting a presidentto be absolutely truthful on personal matters when he heads a government whichoften varnishes the truth--or worse--on matters of much graver importance." Thepaper concluded, "This summer now seems likely to be remembered for the climaxof the Lewinsky saga, but it is not so earth-shaking that it should bring thePresident down." In an op-ed article in the Times of London, AnatoleKaletsky said, "Lewinsky's decision to testify before Kenneth Starr's grandjury was the best possible news for the White House before November'scongressional elections. ... In a straight contest between the word of thePresident and the testimony of a self-confessed fantasist like Monica Lewinskyit is inconceivable that any American court, or even a Republican Congress,would unseat a hugely popular President." And "in the extremely unlikely eventof a move to impeach Mr. Clinton, the same Washington commentators now goadingthe White House would suddenly turn on the Congress, accusing the Republicansof trying to reverse the will of the people by abusing the legal system,"Kaletsky added.            Under theheadline "Clinton Presidency Holed by Starr," the conservative British tabloidDaily Mail said in its main editorial Thursday that "even if the Clintonpresidency is able to run its course, it already resembles a drifting hulk,gutted by the tawdry activities of its skipper, bereft of the moral authorityand energising spirit that should emanate from his great office." In an op-edpiece in the conservative Daily Telegraph, the president's chief British accuser, AmbroseEvans-Pritchard, a former Washington correspondent, turned his fire on Starr,calling him "a trimming, limp-wristed procrastinator with the zeal of a plumpsheep who works part-time on the job, craves approval and bears the imprint ofthe last person who sat on him." Evans-Pritchard concluded that Clinton mightsurvive--"He may skate yet, as they say in Arkansas."            In the Age of Melbourne, the city where Rupert Murdoch grew up, anarticle analyzing the Murdoch divorce said it was "very unlikely that thisdivorce will ever go to court." Anna Murdoch's demand for full disclosure ofhis business interests was "a ruse to wring a settlement out of the man--knownfor his personal parsimony--by hitting him where it hurts most." The Murdochswere a family where business came first, the article said, and that meant twothings: "First, that the price for Murdoch of seeing that business survive insomething like its current shape will be one of the most expensive divorcesettlements ever recorded. And second, that the settlement will be reached outof court."
