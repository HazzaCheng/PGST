The Times of London reportedMonday from Belgrade that a boa constrictor named Madeleine Albright in thecity's zoo has been impregnated by another boa constrictor named WarrenChristopher. Otherwise there was mostly gloom in Europe, about the prospect ofNATO strikes on Serbia. In Italy, the front-line European country into whichAlbanian refugees will pour if attempts to resolve the Kosovo crisis fail--andthe country most exposed to Serbian military retaliation--La Repubblica published afront-page comment Monday that was deeply skeptical of the use of force. Itsaid that Italy and its NATO allies are about to enter a war against Yugoslavia"without anybody, on either side of the Atlantic, having clear ideas about theobjectives or the consequences of a military intervention unprecedented inEurope in this second half of the century."            Signed byLucio Caracciolo, the article said it is impossible to see how NATO action willhelp Albanians suffering in the woods of Kosovo. Instead, it might turnPresident Slobodan Milosevic into a Serbian martyr and permit him to repressthe Albanians even more ferociously after the bombing stops. The only way tohelp the refugees is to open Italy's border to them while simultaneouslyputting large numbers of U.N. troops on the ground in Kosovo.            Caracciolo described U.S. policies as so contradictory that"many believe Washington supports Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia withoutwanting to say so." "There is no grand plan for the Balkans, neither in Americanor anywhere else," he said. "If we bomb, it won't be to impose a solution, aswe don't have one, but because of a need for Clinton to show signs ofinternational political life after his many setbacks, because of the CNN effectthat renders intolerable humanitarian tragedies shown on television at theexpense of all other ones, and in order to save what little credibility remainsto NATO in the Balkans." LaStampa of Turin, however, supported the idea of airstrikes against Serbiaas "a symbolic act" against Milosevic's intransigence. It said RichardHolbrooke gave the impression that he fully understood that "the obstacle toovercome is not in Pristina but in Belgrade."            On theforthcoming Middle East summit at Wye Plantation outside Washington, Ha'aretz of Israel reportedSunday as its main story that Ariel Sharon, Israel's new hard-line foreignminister-designate, will act as a "watchdog" over Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu to ensure he doesn't make too many concessions to the Palestinians.The same paper said in an editorialthat the summit is "not the be-all and end-all, because even if the sides signsome sort of agreement, it will not be able to reverse in one fell swoop thefeeling of alienation that prevails between them." It added, "After all, it isnot the absence of an agreement, but the failure to implement it, that broughtabout the need to meet at Wye Plantation."            In an editorial Monday, the Times of India commendedAmnesty International for strongly criticizing the U.S. human rights record ina recent report. "It accuses the US of refusing to recognise the primacy ofinternational law, reserving the right to use the death penalty againstjuveniles and of being the only country, apart from Somalia, to have failed toratify the UN convention on the rights of the child," the paper said. But itwent on to note "that India's own record on human rights has been appalling,with the complaints registered with the National Human Rights Commissionexceeding 30,000 last year."                           Corriere della Sera of Milan reported an opinion poll finding that 52percent of Italian women between 16 and 24 do not want to have children.Forty-three percent favor the artificial insemination method Jodie Foster isrumored to have used. Only 19 percent said they definitely want to have achild. The principal reason cited for this reluctance: Maternity is seen asimpeding a professional career.
