                                 Dot-Com Mania Is More Selective Than You Think                        One of the basic truisms about investing that's very easy to forget,especially in the middle of the kind of bull market we're in, is that it isn'ta stock market, but rather a market of stocks. In other words, even ifinvestors are generally feeling bullish, that bullishness is not uniform. Itdoes not lead them to forget about distinctions among stocks. Even during theDutch tulip mania, after all, there were some bulbs that seemed priceless andothers that you could buy.            In the most general terms, we all recognize this. Last year, for instance,the clich became that everyone wanted to buy tech stocks and couldn't dealwith the large cyclical or commodity companies. Meanwhile, aluminum producerAlcoa was up 119 percent for the year, more than any other Dow stock, soinvestors were a little more discerning than "tech good, no tech bad." But as abroad generalization, the clich was accurate enough.            The problem comes when the clich is taken to mean that investors are soblindly rushing after stocks of a certain kind that they're not paying anyattention at all to the differences among all those stocks. This is a problembecause if it's true, it means that the market can't be doing what it is meantto do: channel capital to those companies that will use it most productivelyand away from those companies that will not. And it's a problem because if it'sfalse ... well, it's just always a problem when a conclusion is false.            In this case, that's precisely what that conclusion is. Perhaps the mostremarkable thing about this market is that even in a time of seeming universalbuoyancy, when the Nasdaq was up 80-plus percent in 1999 and you could not seemto go wrong as an investor if you were buying anything with a .com at the endof its name or a B2B (business-to-business) label attached to its businessmodel, there are lots of tech stocks that are not doing especially well. Moreto the point, there are lots of tech stocks that have done really well and thenbeen severely punished, and on any given day what you're most likely to see isnot a move upward or downward in which everyone's participating, but asurprising mix of moves.            Take this morning, when the Nasdaq opened up a blistering 120 points, thenquickly tumbled more than 200 points before rallying yet again (it's currentlyup 15 points). Even as some of the tech stalwarts like Cisco and Microsoft(both of which I own) were in free-fall, Net powerhouses like Amazon were upstrong on the day. And even as some of the B2B giants--JDS Uniphase, Foundry,Redback (companies you probably haven't heard of but which now sport $20billion plus market caps)--were zooming, others were headed in the oppositedirection.            On a deeper level, there are now a host of Internet stocks that no longerparticipate in .com mania. IVillage, Marketwatch, MP3, TheStreet.com, TheGlobe, Koop.com, Wit Capital: All of these companies were once darlings of themarket and now see their stocks trade in very narrow ranges not much above--andin some cases below--the prices at which they went public. You could say thisis just a case of market sentiment shifting. But it'd be more accurate to seeit as what it is: a collective verdict on the long-term profit possibilities ofthese companies. Which is, after all, what market sentiment ultimatelymeans.            Of course, investors overreact, in both directions. And sectors do becomehot and witness huge inflows of capital based mainly on trend-following. Butthat kind of indistinct investing doesn't last too long, which is why the ideathat investors today "don't care about profits" is a misreading. If investorsdidn't care about profits, they wouldn't distinguish as carefully as theyultimately do between one unprofitable company and another. In the end (andthis is a good thing), everyone doesn't win. Even if those everyones have .comat the ends of their names.
