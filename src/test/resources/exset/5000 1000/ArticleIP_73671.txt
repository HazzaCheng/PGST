Which New Yorker staffer loved Mr.William Shawn the most? Despite what other biographers might have you believe,it was Ralph Treadwell, The New Yorker 's longtime night-shift guard,whose loyalty to Shawn ran deepest. Though the two never met, Treadwell wouldoften pass the long, quiet hours in the great editor's office, poring over Mr.Shawn's marked-up manuscripts of New Yorker pieces. It was there, hesays, that he met his "only true hero" and began a lifelong love affair withcopy editing.                                             William Shawn, Man of Letters.                Dolores Farber, a Minnesotahousewife, corresponded with Mr. Shawn for over 30 years through two wars,through seven presidential administrations, and through Mr. Shawn's entiretenure as New Yorker editor. After a 10-year silence, Farber has finallycome forward to publish 300 pages of their hitherto secret correspondence. Inletter after letter Mr. Shawn gracefully responds to Farber's lengthy missivesof life, love, and loss with reassuring replies, always beginning with thefamiliar greeting, "We regret that we are unable to use the enclosedmaterial."                                             I Barely Remember Mr. Shawn's New Yorker. She was onlyin the typing pool for three weeks during the winter of 1964, but Ethel Witcombremembers it as though it were yesterday. Sort of. She vividly recalls whattime she clocked in (8:30 a.m.) and how much she paid for lunch at the TasteeCoffeeshop on West 43 rd ($2.75), but critics will find that she's abit vague on other facts and details, when she writes, for example, "I thinkMr. Shawn was the bald one. And he was short. Yeah, I'm almost positive he wasshort. He smelled sweet, too ... like bacon. Best-smelling man atEsquire , Mr. Shawn."                                             Shawn But Not Forgotten.                Most New Yorker ites knew Mr.Shawn for his thoughtful repose, but the old fellow could enjoy a good jokefrom time to time. Mail-room manager Frank Letty recalls that Shawn wouldoccasionally beckon him into his office and, with a smile, offer a dry remarkabout the Yankees or the weather. Always one to reciprocate, Letty wouldfrequently sneak his mail cart up behind the aging Shawn in the office halls,snap his butt with a rubber band, and yell, "Special delivery for ya,Shawnsy."                                                          Outside Mr. Shawn's New Yorker. To New Yorkerwriters, Mr. Shawn was a brilliant, commanding editor, whose pen could make aphrase sparkle on the page. Not so to the man who sold him his candied nuts.Jack O'Rourke, who saw Mr. Shawn nearly every day from his cart outside theNew Yorker offices, remembers him as a cold, taciturn man, who rarelysaid more than, "A bag of nuts, please," or "I think I'll have some of thosetasty nuts."

The novelists,journalists, and thinkers whose prose filled Shawn's New Yorker spentmuch of their days roaming the office halls, striking up spirited discussionsof literature or current affairs. But for Tony Gerwitz, whose accounting firmoccupied the floor immediately below the magazine, the era was marked only by aloud, unceasing trudging overhead. "Intellectuals are all well and good,"writes Gerwitz in his memoir, "but when they're stomping around above you allday, it becomes hard to balance the books."
