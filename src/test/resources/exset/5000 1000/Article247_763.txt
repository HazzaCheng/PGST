                                 House Call            Everybody leads with Kenneth Starr's House call and give up about half ofthe rest of their fronts to various aspects of the quote news unquote.Yesterday the papers told you what he would say. Today they tell you what hedid say. They don't tell you it's the same thing.            USAT calls yesterday's proceeding "marathon, heavily partisan" and saysStarr "generally kept his cool" as he personally made his brief againstPresident Clinton. The paper sees in the end-of-the-day exchanges between Starrand Clinton's personal attorney David Kendall "a dramatic prime-time showdownof legal heavyweights." The WP notes instead that Starr seemed moreprofessorial than prosecutorial.            As USAT , the NYT, and the WP note, there was little discussionof Starr's conclusions, the emphasis falling instead on Starr's motives andconduct--the main issues there being whether or not Starr had an antecedentbias against Bill Clinton, had inappropriate connections to the Paula Jonesdefense team, whether he had unlawfully detained Monica Lewinsky and/orviolated her right to an attorney and indeed, whether he had lied about histreatment of her in a press release. There was also some discussion of whetheror not Starr illegally leaked to the press. The LAT alone highlights Starr'ssole concession in the face of all this: that perhaps when requesting fromJanet Reno expansion of his charge into Jones-related matters, he should haveinformed her of the discussions he'd previously had with Jones' lawyers.            The WP notes that in contrast to the 453-page report Starr served upin September, the day's discussions were distinctly "G-rated." The Posteven quantifies the point, noting that in Starr's opening remarks, he used"sex" or "sexual" just four times, compared to at least 60 references to"truth" or "lying." Everybody prints one of the day's few carnal references:Democratic Rep. John Conyers' characterization of Starr as a "federally paidsex policeman."            The WSJ reports that on Wednesday night, the Judiciary Democrats got theirhands on General Accounting Office figures on Ken Starr's office expenditures,which, a congressional source is quoted as saying, are potentiallyembarrassing, in that they detail payments for consultants and outsideinvestigators. The paper says that to keep the Dems from using the materialduring the hearings yesterday, Henry Hyde declared it confidential.            The NYT and LAT say Starr testified Clinton could, afterleaving office, be prosecuted for perjury. But the WP and USATsay Starr didn't answer the question. According to a USAT poll,respondents give Starr positive reviews, but also want their House member tovote against impeachment.            Meanwhile, for real Lewinsky spontaneity, you had to be in Japan with thepresident, where, the papers all report, during a "town meeting," Bill Clintonwas asked by an Osaka housewife how he apologized to his wife and daughter forhis affair. Clinton replied that he did so "in a direct and straightforwardmanner." The NYT says Clinton expected such a question on the trip,primarily dedicated to economic issues. The LAT says the White House didnot count on the scandal coming up, because of the "Japanese people's famousreserve."            The WSJ runs a useful feature describing what signs to look for totell if the global economic crisis is coming to a close. The list includes:When the financial markets yawn in the face of bad news, when yields onemerging market bonds go down, when inflation jitters return, when commodityprices rise, when emerging nations start importing more, and when Japan'seconomy starts to expand again. On the other hand, a sign of how much money iswashing around this country is on full display in USAT 's front-pager onexpensive toys. It seems that nowadays you don't have to go to FAO Schwarz tosink serious money into silly stuff. According to the paper, 8 percent of theitems at Toys R Us go for $100 or more, as do five of the fifteen top-sellingtoys this year. Essentials like Kawasaki Ninja Power Wheels and My InteractivePooh.            The fronts at the NYT , WP , and LAT all feature storiesabout alarming new research (to be published today in the British MedicalJournal ) about the death toll in China from smoking. Right now, it seemscigarettes kill 700,000 Chinese per year, most of them men in their middleyears. Unless the country's habits change, this rate is forecast to multiplyfourfold within fifty years.            It's not exactly perjury, but the LAT observes that duringyesterday's proceedings, Ken Starr sat at the witness table on top of abriefcase, "which made him appear taller."
