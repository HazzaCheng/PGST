                                 Last Gasp of the Intelligentsia                        Lots of people are complaining that Edmund Morris is a biographer who likesto make things up. In his new biography of Reagan, Morris has invented not justone but several characters who interact with Reagan at various stages in hislife. Isn't this ironic? Reagan himself was accused throughout his career offailing to distinguish between fact and fiction. Yet I think Morris' techniquecan be defended if it helps us understand Reagan better. Unfortunately, it doesnot.            As a Reagan biographer myself, I can testify that Morris is right: Reaganwas a complex, mysterious man. Many Americans who saw him on television everyday thought they understood him, but they kept forgetting that he was an actor.A C-student who graduated from Eureka College, Reagan was in many respects anordinary man. Yet extraordinary things happened in the 1980s: the taming ofinflation, the revival of economic growth, the technological revolution, thebeginning of the end of the Cold War.            So did Reagan do these things? And if he did, how did such an ordinaryfellow perform such extraordinary feats? Morris' biography contributes littleto our understanding of this large issue. He gives Reagan credit for his forceof will, but he does not credit Reagan's force of intellect. Reflecting theprejudices of the intelligentsia, Morris in his book and in interviews hasdescribed Reagan as "ignorant," an "airhead," and a "yahoo."            Yet it was this very yahoo who in the early 1980s repeatedly predicted thefall of communism. He did this at a time when there was complete agreementamong the sophisticated class--Republican and Democrat, hawk and dove,conservative and liberal--that the Soviet empire was permanent. So how didReagan know something about the vulnerability of Soviet communism that all thelearned pundits, including the entire Soviet Studies community, did not know?Morris' 800 pages brings you no closer to understanding why, on this immenselyimportant question, the wise men proved to be wrong and the dummy proved to beright.            Here's another question. Why did the computer revolution occur in the 1980s?Why didn't it happen in the 1970s? Reagan is no more responsible for inventingthe Internet than Al Gore. But is it possible that Reagan's policies such asthe tax cuts, deregulation, privatization of government assets, and thecelebration of the entrepreneur as the true American hero, created thenecessary political and social framework for the silicon revolution? ManySilicon Valley entrepreneurs I've spoken to say that without Reagan thecomputer revolution may have happened, but it wouldn't have happened as fast asit did. So what does Morris think about this? Nothing. It's not that he adoptsa position I disagree with. He seems unaware that this is an important subjectof debate. In the sphere of politics, it is Morris, not Reagan, who comesacross looking like an ignoramus.            Unable to fathom Reagan's public accomplishments, Morris focuses on hispersonal life. Even here there are no big revelations. Morris speculates thatReagan married his first wife, Jane Wyman, because she threatened to commitsuicide if he didn't. But the source for this turns out to be Reagan's secondwife, Nancy Reagan. All we can learn from this episode is that second wivesdon't like to think that their husbands wanted to marry their first wives.Morris also makes much of the fact that Reagan in the mid-'30s consideredjoining the Communist Party but was turned down because they regarded him as a"flake." Does this prove that Reagan was a lightweight? On the contrary, itreveals that the Commies were even more inept than previously thought. Reaganwould have been an unbelievably good catch, and if he had stayed with thissorry lot, he would have been their best chance to win mainstreamacceptability.            Morris' failure is symptomatic of the failure of the intelligentsia in thiscountry to comprehend Reagan. Perhaps it also reflects an attempt to avengeReagan's rout of the intellectual class. We are now living in the world thatReagan made, a world in which entrepreneurs and not intellectuals are directingthe nation's future. So will Morris have the last word on Reagan's legacy? Inthe words of one of Tom Wolfe's characters, fuhgetaboutit . Historywill remember Reagan as one of the two great presidents of the 20 thcentury. (The other was FDR.) He will be cherished as the man who won the ColdWar and revived the American economy and the American spirit. Morris' book willbe a footnote.
