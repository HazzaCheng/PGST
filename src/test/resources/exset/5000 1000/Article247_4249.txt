                                 Tough Sit            The New York Timesand Los AngelesTimes lead with the agreement that New Jersey struck Wednesday with theDept. of Justice that's designed to ensure that the state's highway police stopusing race as a factor in making traffic stops. The Washington Post leads with testimony from last week's courthearing for Wen Ho Lee in which an FBI agent said that Lee went to unusuallengths to mislead his colleagues at Los Alamos about what he was doing whenduring nighttime and weekend sessions, he downloaded onto portable tapes thehighly classified nuclear secrets to which he had access. USA Todayleads with a new poll (undertaken with CNN and Gallup) indicating that, becauseof the latest terrorism concerns, 50 percent of respondents are less likely toattend public gatherings on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day. The poll alsofound that nearly two-thirds of those asked thought it was at least somewhatlikely that an act of terrorism would occur somewhere in the U.S. on one ofthose two days. The story also reports that on Wednesday a federal grand juryindicted the Algerian arrested in Washington state for trying to smugglebombmaking components into the country, a development that is fronted at theWP and reefered at the NYT . Neither the Post norUSAT front the racial profiling story.            Both Times leads state that under the New Jersey profiling deal, thestate police will report to a federal monitor who will have broad powers toinvestigate virtually any police function and who will track the cops' patternsof arrests and traffic stops to make sure that minorities are not being singledout. Neither story really gets at the nuances involved in really doing this.The NYT mentions for instance that under the agreement with Justice,troopers are still allowed to make a race-based stop when they are pursuing aspecific criminal suspect, but neither story says whether an all pointsbulletin saying to be on the look out for say, a fleeing black or Latino isspecific enough. And neither addresses whether or not race-driven stops thatresult in an arrest or conviction will/should be counted as racialprofiling.            The NYT 's story does not include any negative reactions from cops,but the LAT 's does, including a harsh one from L.A.'s black policechief: "It's not the fault of the police when they stop minority males or putthem in jail. It's the fault of the minority males for committing thecrime."            The LAT front reports that the U.S. Army is on the verge of adoptingits first new rifle in thirty years. The weapon would use the precisionguidance technology already common in planes and tanks to deliver rounds thatexplode in the air above enemy soldiers, thereby lessening their ability tosurvive battlefield small arms fire by taking cover. There are question markshowever: the weapon is more than twice as heavy as the M-16 it would replace,and it's not clear if its complex works are really combat-hardy. The LATwaits until pretty deep into the story to raise another very realistic worry:these weapons would wreak havoc in the hands of guerrillas. And hey, given thetrack record of the M-16 and its ilk--what about in the hands of streetcriminals?            A NYT front-pager describes an Oregon experiment that intensifies the issuessurrounding the possibility of adding genes to human embryos. And the headlinemakes the whole thing sound like science gone mad: "SCIENTISTS PLACE JELLYFISHGENES INTO MONKEYS."            The WP reports that Louis Farrakhan, recovering from prostate cancer,yesterday made his first public appearance in nearly a year. Appearingalongside a Catholic priest and a rabbi, Farrakhan called on all peoples of theworld to "end the cycle of violence and the cycle of hatred."            The NYT front identifies at least one area of the economy that'sbooming as a result of Y2K: the babysitting sector. In big cities, New Year'sEve rates of upwards of $100 an hour are common. Also pulling down premiumprices for the big night: pet sitters and security guards.            The Wall Street Journal front returns to the arena of one ofits more widely read pieces of 1999--an airline nightmare story--to tell thetale of U.S Airways' MetroJet Flight 2762, an evening flight from Atlanta toDulles that has the distinction of being this year's most delayed flight. Thescheduled 70-minute hop, says the Journal , averages an hour behindschedule. It is late 80 percent of the time. The piece quotes the pilot of onenight's flight after an 80-minute runway stint followed by controller-orderedzigzag patterns over the ocean: "We hate it too."
