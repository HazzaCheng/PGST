                                 The Picture-Perfect Fed                        So now the Fed has taken all the rate cuts back. Last summer and fall, whenit sometimes felt as if the global economy were on the verge of a massivenervous breakdown, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three consecutivetimes--including one between-meetings rate cut--to ensure that suddenly panickylenders didn't strangle access to credit. The U.S. economy, perhaps as aresult, didn't even hiccup, while the stock market, which had plummeted in thewake of Asian turmoil, Russian devaluation, and the collapse of Long-TermCapital Management, came roaring back. But after today's 25-basis-point ratehike, the federal funds rate now stands at 5.50 percent, exactly where it wasbefore the chaos of last summer.            To me, this looks like nearly picture-perfect central banking, especiallysince the U.S. economy continues to grow at a fast pace, unemployment continuesto shrink, and inflation at the consumer level remains in check. There arevoices of dissent who think that Alan Greenspan is paying too much attention toWall Street and that the continued rise in stock prices is entirely the productof the Fed's distribution of easy money. But that case has been weakened notonly by the Fed's own rate hikes but also by the powerful rally in the bondmarket in recent weeks. Thirty-year interest rates are back down near 6percent, after trading close to 6.5 percent, and they would not be there ifbond traders--for whom vigilance about inflation is a cardinal law--thought theFed was letting us all live high on the hog by printing lots of greenbacks.            In any case, Fed-watching has become so ubiquitous that it's harder to saysomething new about Alan Greenspan than about Martha Stewart. But there are twoimportant things to keep in mind about this most recent hike. The first is thateven if the Fed's performance over the past year and a half looks perfect, wedon't actually know if it was. By this I mean something more than just theobvious point, which is that history has no control group. I also mean that themost important driver of non-inflationary growth--businessproductivity--remains something of a mystery to economists.            Productivity growth remains very strong, at 4.1 percent in the most recentquarter, though the rate of that growth has slowed slightly (very slightly).And it seems increasingly clear that the effects on productivity ofcomputerization and the Internet are real and not temporary blips. But whythose effects are being felt now, how long they will last, how much ofproductivity growth is being driven by businesses running leaner than they oncedid: These questions don't have firm answers. Nor, for that matter, do wereally understand why productivity growth slowed so rapidly in the 1970s. Sowhile the Fed deserves credit for its performance, most of what's going on inthis Goldilocks economy is out of its control.            The second thing worth noticing is that the popular understanding of therole of the Fed seems to have shifted in the past year and a half, arguably asa result of its quick action last year. The conventional wisdom was that ittook six months to a year for a Fed rate hike to work its way into the economy,which makes sense since raising or lowering interest rates generally isn't likeslamming a door open or shut. It's more like easing it open or closed. But whatwe've seen more recently is the idea that one of the Fed's key roles ispsychological. It wasn't the literal opening of the taps last fall thatmattered but rather the symbolic message the Fed sent lenders, which was thatit was OK to take on a little risk at a time when the only thing anyone wantedto do was buy 30-year U.S. bonds. Similarly, no one really believes thatraising the Fed funds rate from 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent is going to putthe brakes on economic growth (although the gradual rise from 4.75 percent to5.50 percent has to have had some effect). But people do believe that it willsend the right message to lenders and borrowers. To be sure, ultimately themessage carries weight because it's backed by the Fed's actions. But inconcrete terms, the Fed's actions probably won't have an effect for sixmonths to a year. The Fed's message, though, is already at work right now.
