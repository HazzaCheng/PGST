                                 NYT Buries Lead!            The Washington Post leads with indications that PresidentClinton may drop his appeal of last week's court decision holding that his topaides may be questioned by Kenneth Starr. The New York Timesgoes with Clinton's comment Sunday that the U.S. would support newinternational financial aid to Russia if its debt situation worsens. USA Todayleads with this year's big increase in killer tornadoes--nearly double thetwister death toll for all of 1997, and a 365 percent increase over the totalfor 1996. The Los Angeles Times leads with the likelihood that Congresswill approve the most sweeping changes in bankruptcy law in decades--which willmake it significantly harder for those with annual family incomes over $50,000to wipe out their debts. The WP lead is on the USAT front but noothers. Neither the NYT nor LAT leads are on anybody else'sfront.            Besides executive privilege, the WP reports that two otherlegal decisions incident to the Lewinsky case must also be made soon: whetherthe DOJ will challenge a court decision ordering Secret Service agents totestify, and whether Clinton himself will testify before Starr's grandjury.            According to the NYT , Clinton's Sunday statement concerning debt assistance to Russiawas timed to spread calm among the Asian financial markets before they openedfor the week. A senior administration official tells the paper that direct U.S.aid is not being contemplated, but rather IMF and World Bank monies, whichmeans 80 percent non-U.S. funds. The Times offers a helpful explanationof the hoped-for result: once investors realize the U.S. and the internationalfunds are determined to support Russia, they will stop dumping the ruble, whichmay mean that actually making the loans becomes unnecessary. This is, says theNYT , "a form of deterrence theory." The story runs inside at theWP .            The Wall Street Journal runs a front-page story about how stockbrokers hustle clients . The techniques describedinclude pretending also to be on the phone with another client who just placeda big order with the broker or who just made half a million dollars with him.The big flaw with the story: it never says whether or not such ruses areillegal.            The LAT front points out a rather sticky dilemma now arising for theU.S. in the wake of the new Asian arms race. The Indian and Pakistani nuclearweapons are, the paper observes, probably, like the U.S. and Soviet programs ofthe 50s and 60s, quite unsafe--vulnerable to both physical mishaps and commandand control mistakes. So the question is, should the U.S. help both countriesmake their bombs safer? Although to do so would violate the new U.S. sanctionsimposed on both countries and could provoke international complaints thatAmerica is spreading nuclear know-how, the LAT reports that "outsideanalysts" think such a course of action is probably under consideration.            A topic of immeasurable social and intellectual importance is very unwiselyburied deep inside the NYT business section: How could a story about"Today's Papers" be so badly underplayed?            A piece inside the WP reports that although the government has issued30,000 letters authorizing the installation of airbag cut-off switches in cars and trucks, only 1,000 ofthese have been accepted by auto dealers and service shops. The reason? Thesefacilities are worried about legal liability, but this doesn't add up, sincethe story goes on to explain that the automakers have agreed to indemnify thosedoing the cut-off work.            The NYT has obtained a draft of a U.S. government report on Nazi gold taken from Jews--primarily as jewelry and teethfillings--during World War II, and writes it up on the top-front. Principalfindings: There was twice as much gold seized in this fashion as previouslyestimated; it was used to pay--mostly in transactions handled by the SwissNational Bank--for a huge share of Nazi war needs purchased from Portugal,Spain, Sweden and Turkey; and two major German banks, Dresdner Bank andDeutsche Bank, neither previously implicated and both now doing considerablebusiness in the U.S., had major roles in the transactions.            Sunday's NYT "Week in Review" reports on the steady rise in volumelevels at the movies. The paper reports that a recent New York City showing of"Bulworth" dwelt mostly in the vacuum cleaner range, except for when WarrenBeatty was rapping, taking things up to somewhere between jackhammer and carhorn. "Today's Papers" has been employing an effective countermeasure fornearly twenty years: earplugs. These not only offer excellent protection fromhearing loss, but also from noisy theatergoers and inane movie dates.
