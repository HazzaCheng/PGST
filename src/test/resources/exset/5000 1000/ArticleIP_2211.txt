                                 Hackathalon                           TheHackathlon                        Fred Barnes, the Washingtoncommentator, is (we think) the original source of a profound insight on thenature of journalism--indeed, on human nature. "The most important quality anypiece of writing can have," he says, "is doneness ." (A related remark isattributed to Gloria Steinem: "I don't like writing. I like havingwritten.")            It is in this spirit that                  Slate                this week kicks off its first annual "Hackathlon." TheHackathlon will be officiated by Deputy Editor Jack Shafer, who apparentlyfeels there isn't enough bad writing in                   Slate               . Fourself-proclaimed hacks (insert earnest demurral here: Oh, no, they're actuallyextremely talented, etc., etc., etc.) will compete in trying to produce a piecein a hurry. Readers will vote on whose work comes closest to resembling arespectable work of journalism. Since true hackability is fearless andfungible, the contestants will be tested in a variety of journalisticgenres.            This year's hackathletesare: Malcolm Gladwell of The New Yorker , Michael Specter of the NewYork Times , Hanna Rosin of the New Republic , and Geoffrey Wheatcroftof British publications too numerous to mention. The Hackathlon is aworld-class event: Gladwell will be filing from New York City; Specter fromMoscow; Rosin from Washington, D.C.; and Wheatcroft from Bath, England. Shaferwill officiate from Redmond, Wash. Here are Shafer's instructions to theplayers:            "Each Saturday, I wille-mail each hack a Hackathlon topic, a cheat sheet (notes, quotes, and facts),and the name of a specific publication whose style each hack is expected toape. The hacks will have two hours to complete the assignment and e-mail me atHack Central. If any hack takes longer than two hours to complete his/herassignment, we will report this transgression on the page with his/hercopy.            "The four events: a NewYork Times Op-Ed (maximum length, 750 words); a New Yorker "Talk ofthe Town" (maximum length, 750 words); the First 1,000 Words of a VanityFair profile; a Breaking News Story.            "Don't write parody. As oneaccomplished hack put it, the essence of hackery is 'adjusting to a minimum ofinformation to produce the maximum journalistic effect.' Actually, he went on alittle longer to fill the available space. I've taken the liberty of truncatinghis remarks.            "The collected hackwork willbe posted on                   Slate                on four successive Tuesdays, beginning Nov.11. Readers will be invited to vote for the best hackwork in each event. Thehack who collects the most votes will be declared victor and be invited toreturn next year to face challengers. The cheat sheets will be published forreaders' inspection.            "Prepareyourselves."                           ReaderSurvey, Round 2                        While thehacks are hacking away, we've got homework for you as well. But it will take alot less than two hours. We'd be grateful if you took a few minutes to fill outour second annual online reader survey. It will be on our site for two weeks,beginning Friday, Nov. 7. All the questions are easy: "What is the capital ofNorth Dakota?" "Who is the chairman of the Microsoft Corp.?" "What is yourcredit-card number?" That sort of thing. E-mail                   Slate                readerswill get the survey by e-mail. Last year almost 4,000                   Slate               readers answered our survey. They seemed to enjoy it, and it was extremelyhelpful to us. Thanks.                           Correction, Sort Of                        Michael Lewis' "Millionerds"column, as originally posted, stated that his subject this week--T.J. Rodgers,CEO of Cypress Semiconducter--despises Gil Amelio, former CEO of AppleComputer, because of Amelio's support for President Clinton. The article wasposted Tuesday evening (Nov. 4), and by Wednesday morning we had received halfa dozen e-mail messages from various readers establishing beyond question, withsupportive documentation, that Amelio supported George Bush in 1992 and BobDole in 1996. So, in keeping with our policy, the article was amended. ButRodgers did tell Lewis that he despises Amelio because Amelio supportedClinton, so it is Rodgers' mistake, not our author's, that we arecorrecting.                           --Michael Kinsley
