                                 See Hillary Run                        Issue 1 is the New York Senate race. Issue 2 is the GOP presidentialcampaign.            Interviews: On Fox News Sunday , Newt Gingrich compliments current HouseSpeaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for being a better dealmaker than he was.Gingrich says he prefers his current life on the lecture circuit to beingspeaker because lecturing better suits his idealistic temperament and doesn'trequire day-to-day detail work. Gingrich says the GOP should stick to fivecampaign themes in the 2000 election: 1) the rescue of Social Security throughPersonal Savings Accounts (a type of privatization); 2) the establishment of a"global missile defense"; 3) the limitation of taxes in peacetime to 25 percentof income; 4) the abolition of the inheritance tax; and 5) the securing ofpatients' rights through health-care reform. On CNN's LateEdition , Donald Trump says he would personally spend $100 million ifhe ran for president (in addition to spending the Reform Party's more than $12million in federal funds).            Despite Hillary Clinton's pointed announcement last week that she "intendsto run" for a New York Senate seat, several pundits--Fred Barnes ( Fox )and Kate O'Beirne (CNN's Capital Gang )--and politicians--Donald Trump and Rep. GuyMolinari, R-N.Y. (both on Late Edition )--think she has left somewiggle room and may yet duck out at the 11th hour. Some Giuliani supporterspoint to Harold Ickes' remark in a new Gail Sheehy book that Clinton's Senaterun will be about personal "redemption" (to buy Hillary's Choice ,click here). Asked about this on Late Edition , Ickesdoesn't own up to the statement, but he doesn't deny it either. Mark Shields(PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ) notes that both Giuliani andClinton have negative ratings topping 40 percent; only 8 percent to 9 percentof voters are undecided, an unusually low number with nearly a year untilElection Day. Susan Page ( Late Edition ) says that a new Giuliani TV adquestioning Hillary's devotion to Israel is smart, because the Jews are one ofthe few swing votes left.            Several programs cite Friday's Time /CNN poll showing John McCain and George W. Bush in a statistical deadheat in New Hampshire--37 percent to 35 percent, respectively, with a 4.5percent margin of error. (Tim Russert [NBC's Meet thePress ], Cokie Roberts [ABC's This Week ], and Wolf Blitzer [ Late Edition ]assert that McCain is ahead in the Granite State; only Bill Kristol [ ThisWeek ] points out that McCain's two-point lead is statisticallymeaningless.) George F. Will ( This Week ) notes that even if McCainwins New Hampshire, Bush still leads by over 40 points in South Carolina. ButKristol points out that when Gary Hart beat Walter Mondale in New Hampshire in1984, Hart's polls suddenly rose by 20 points nationally (left unspoken: Hartlost the nomination anyway). Tucker Carlson ( Late Edition ) argues thatSteve Forbes' poor showing in the Time poll (8 percent), despite hismillions of dollars, should give pause to advocates of campaign-finance reform.George Stephanopoulos ( This Week ) says that Forbes could still hurtBush in Iowa, which would add to McCain's momentum should he win New Hampshire.But Steve Roberts ( Late Edition ) says that Bush's New Hampshirenumbers will improve once he spends some time there, and Matthew Rees( NewsHour ) thinks that McCain's New Hampshire numbers have peaked.                           And You Thought Buchanan and Fulani Made an Odd Couple...                        On Late Edition , Reform Party hopeful Donald Trump ticks offmembers of his ideal presidential Cabinet:            Vice President: Oprah WinfreyHUD: Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.State: Gen. Colin Powell (Ret.)Defense: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.Treasury: Jack Welch, outgoing General Electric CEO                           Last Word                                       I think that it would be a very, very bad thing to have Bill Bradley aspresident. He's almost Marxist in his leanings.               [Hillary] stays in Trump Tower when she's in New York. ... At least she hasgreat taste.               I do shake hands, [but] I think it's a terrible custom. ... It's almostbarbaric in a certain way.               I don't take drugs--I've never had drugs in my life--I've never had a glassof alcohol, I've never had a cup of coffee, I've never had a cigarette. I dolove women. But I'm single, [so] I'm allowed to do that, I guess. But I respectwomen, I admire women, and if that's supposed to be bad, then I'm guilty.                     --Donald Trump ( Late Edition )
