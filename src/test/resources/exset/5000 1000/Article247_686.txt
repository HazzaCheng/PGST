                                 Starr Gazing            Everybody leads with the expected near-simultaneous release today to theCongress and the American people of the Starr report. You can't tell from theUSAToday and Los Angeles Times headlines what the report says Clintondid. And indeed, the LAT lead never says. For that you have to turn tothe Washington Post and New York Timesheadlines, which make it plain: lied (both papers), obstructed justice (thePost ) and abused power (the NYT ).            The LAT lead emphasizes the struggle yesterday between get-it-out-nowHouse Republicans and pro-delay Democrats over the timing of the report'srelease, a battle, say the papers, the Republicans have won. The LATcites one argument Democrats wielded, but to no avail: when the House Ethicscommittee reprimanded Newt Gingrich last year, he was given an advance copy ofthe report. Only the WP notices that in describing the Starr report asone-sided, White House lawyer David Kendall was analyzing a report he hadn'tread.                           USAT also tells of the pre-release battle and repeats its account ofthe report's charges from yesterday's edition: that Clinton obstructed justicein trying to find Monica Lewinsky a job and lied twice under oath about hisrelationship with her. These charges are expounded at much greater length inthe NYT and WP . Oddly, USAT buries until thethird-from-the-bottom paragraph the news that a source says Starr concludesClinton committed eleven offenses that could warrant impeachment, a detail theWP rightly puts in its lead's first sentence.                           USAT says the report includes "graphic details about sexualencounters" between Clinton and Lewinsky but leaves it at that. The LATgoes a little farther with such titillating non-titillation, quoting a sourcetelling the reporter, "I don't know how a newspaper like yours will be able tohandle some of this material." But the NYT and especially the WP wade into the details, and even though BillClinton told Senate Democrats yesterday at a White House meeting that Starr'sreport would contain "no surprises," some of the details are new: Lewinskytestified that on two occasions she engaged in a sex act with Clinton while hetalked on the phone with members of Congress (say both papers) and theWP prints the Dutch Master-bator tale of Drudge Report fame thataccording to her, the two once used a cigar as a prop in a sex act.            All the papers have comments from Cabinet members and Democratic senatorswho met yesterday with Clinton behind closed doors. Most describe a repentantBill Clinton. (In a sort of Atonement Watch, the NYT runs a chronology with excerpts ofthe six Clinton apologies to date.) But the WP reports that at theCabinet meeting, when HHS Secretary Donna Shalala asked Clinton if he didn'tthink he had an obligation to provide moral leadership, Clinton "let her have it," saying that if her logic hadprevailed in 1960, Richard Nixon would have been elected instead of JohnKennedy. After that exchange, says the Post 's source, no other Cabinetmember had anything critical to say.            The off-lead at the LAT , the WP and NYT , whichUSAT plays on the front below the fold, is Boris Yeltsin's decision toname Yevgeny Primakov, his current foreign minister, as his new primeminister. The papers all note that the choice met with the communists' approvaland hence is likely to be approved by the parliament, possibly resolving thecountry's leadership crisis. Also widely noted is that Primakov, an experienceddiplomat, has no expertise in the area of the country's burning problem,economics. The WP seems particularly down on the move though--aneditorial describes him as a "KGB veteran and friend ofdictators everywhere."            Inside pieces at both the WP and the NYT report that theSenate yesterday killed an attempt at campaign finance reform, probably tablingsuch efforts for the rest of the year. The arguments of the corruptions ofmoney vs. the freedom to contribute and raise it were the same-old same-old,but this time, notes the Times , there was also the deepening distractionof possible impeachment proceedings. Similarly, the Wall Street Journal "Washington Wire" says the Starr reportmeans the chances of a managed care overhaul coming out of Congress this yearare zero.            The USAT front features a poll that says two-thirds of Americansthink Bill Clinton should stay in office. But Martha Stewart may not be one ofthem. The WP says today's broadcast of "Martha Stewart Living" wassupposed to be a lunch get-together with Bill Clinton the hostess had tapedback in June. But instead, viewers will see a rerun.
