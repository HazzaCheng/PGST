                                                            Fool'sParadise                        In the business world thereused to be deals or, sometimes, partnerships. These days, there are strategicalliances. The term "strategic alliance" is intended to 1) sound glamorous andforward-thinking; and 2) obscure the actual nature of the relationship. It cancover anything from an actual merger to an occasional lunch. (It is anentertaining parlor game to read about some new strategic alliance, especiallyin the high-tech world, and try to guess who--if anyone--is paying whom. Theanswer is often far from obvious.)            Slate, of course, wishes tobe glamorous and forward-thinking. So we are pleased to begin this week astrategic alliance with the Motley Fool. The Fool, as many readers are aware, is one of themost entertaining, illuminating, and successful online financial sites, withoutlets on both America Online and the Web. The Slate/Fool strategic alliancewill consist of lavish expressions of mutual admiration, cross-links betweenour sites at even the least plausible opportunity, and exchanges of T-shirts,baseball caps, and other logo paraphernalia. In addition, the Fool will beproviding, exclusively for Slate, a weekly business column. The column is notabout stock tips or breaking news, but rather is intended to be a discerningbackgrounder on business issues, somewhat in the style of Slate's "The Gist." (And who's payingwhom? Guess.) Slate's first "Fool" is about the corporate fashion for changingnames.            Nextweek, by the way, we will continue to ramp up our business coverage with"Maximum Wage," a monthly column by Graef (Bud) Crystal, America's leadingauthority on CEO compensation. (His article on Mike Ovitz's notorious $90million severance package from Disney appeared in Slate a few months back.) Each columnwill analyze the pay of one or more top executives who are of interest forbeing paid too much or (occasionally) too little. Graef's first column,to be posted next week, will focus on one from each category--both women.                           A Doctorin the House                        A commoncomplaint about Slate--and, indeed, about Webzines in general--is that we don'twrite enough about castration. Like hang gliding and Albanian cuisine, this isa subject most people would rather read about than try for themselves. We aredelighted, therefore, that our new "MedicalExaminer" columnist has chosen castration as the subject of his firstcolumn. Medical Examiner will appear every other week in Slate. We cannotpromise that every column will be about castration. In fact, we can pretty muchpromise that no more columns will be about castration. But they all willdeal with the general subject of health, science, and society. The author isAtul Gawande, M.D., who wrote a fascinating Slate "Diary" acouple of weeks ago about his life as a surgical resident in Boston. Atul alsoworked on health-care reform as a White House aide during the first Clintonterm--an experience about which he has mixed feelings.
