                                 The Justice Department's Blunt Instrument                        It's just an odd coincidence, but there did seem to be something tellingabout the "What's News" section on the front page of today's Wall StreetJournal, which listed as its first item the findings of fact in theMicrosoft antitrust trial and as its second Pfizer's $74 billion hostile bidfor Warner-Lambert. (Pfizer is attempting to muscle out American Home Products,which wants to have a friendly merger with Warner-Lambert.)            The first item describes the results of the U.S. government's relentlesspursuit of a company it argues--and Judge Jackson agrees--is a monopolistengaged in anti-competitive behavior. The second item, by contrast, describesthe results of the U.S. government's general indifference to theanti-competitive implications of the huge wave of mergers that continues tosweep across every sector of the U.S. economy. And the logical question theseitems raises is: What's the difference?            To be sure, it's not entirely fair to say that the Justice Department andthe Federal Trade Commission have been asleep at the wheel when it comes topursuing antitrust cases. They have blocked the Staples-Office Depot merger andthe Lockheed-Northrop Grumman deal, and threw a monkey wrench (ill-advisedly,but still) into Barnes & Noble's proposed acquisition of book distributorIngram. And in other cases, they've forced companies to sell off divisions ormake other changes before mergers would be approved.            On the whole, though, the consolidation of industries ranging from financialservices to telecommunications to aerospace to the drug industry has proceededremarkably fast and with remarkably little interference. And what's perplexingabout this, particularly in light of the Microsoft case, is that mergers oftenhave an immediate anti-competitive impact, in the simplest sense that theyreduce the number of players in a market. If the Justice Department's defaultposition is that competition protects consumers--a sensible enoughposition--then it's hard to see why the merger boom should not be scrutinizedmore carefully than it has been.            Of course, antitrust law is a very blunt instrument, and should be used onlywhen real harm can be discerned. But antitrust law is also much better suitedto preventing the formation of giant megacorporations--it is calledanti- trust law, after all--than to eradicating monopolies that havearisen by other means.            Remember that monopolies per se are not illegal. In fact, theestablishment of temporary monopolies--of taste, of technology, or ofdistribution--is the only way that companies are able to reap meaningfuleconomic profits, which otherwise would be immediately competed away. Amonopoly becomes illegal only when the company exercising it uses that monopolyto shut out competitors in other markets, either through coercion or bysubsidizing low, competition-killing prices in that market. (Again, manyacademic economists question whether this last tactic is really feasible, butantitrust law depends on the assumption that it is.) And this, of course, isexactly what Judge Jackson's findings of fact say Microsoft did.            Oddly, though, when the Justice Department's Joel Klein appeared on ABC'sThis Week over the weekend, he seemed to be saying something more thanthat Microsoft had acted in ways that were unacceptable for a monopolist. Heseemed to suggest that being a monopolist was itself unacceptable. "You know,in America you have a choice," he said. "And if IBM or Gateway or Compaq orDell ... had a choice, they could go to Microsoft and negotiate (or) they couldgo to somebody else and negotiate. Here, everybody's got to go to oneplace--that's what's hurting us."            That's an audacious reading--or rather rewriting--of antitrust law, andsuggests that what Klein wants is not just the breaking up of Microsoft intoseparate companies but the breaking up of Microsoft's operating-system divisioninto competing companies (since otherwise there still wouldn't be choice ofdifferent versions of Windows for IBM or Gateway or Dell). Maybe next we canblock any further acquisitions by Pfizer and tell it that it has to set upcompeting companies to distribute different versions of Viagra, too.
