                                 The Middle Kingdom            Topic A on the weekend talkshows was China, with Campaigngate coming in second and the Microsoft tusslewith the Justice Department a distant third.            On China,Morton Kondracke of The McLaughlin Group staked the center ground asusual. We should "engage" the Chinese, he said, but we should also "criticizethem." The weight of pundit opinion may have tilted ever so slightly toward the"criticize" part of this elegant formula. Pat Buchanan appeared on both CNN'sLate Edition and Fox News Sunday to advocate punishing China forits human-rights violations, high trade barriers, and arms sales to roguenations such as Iran. This Week panelist Bill Kristol said the WhiteHouse needs to "stand up for American principles" instead of "kowtowing" to thevisiting Chinese leader. Even George Stephanopoulos dissed his former boss abit. The United States "has gone too far to roll out the carpet." The Chinese"are playing us like a fiddle," he said.            But establishment heavies weighed in strongly enough totilt the overall Sunday balance back toward "engage." Lawrence Eagleburger( Late Edition ) and Henry Kissinger ( Fox News Sunday ) said thatthe United States should stay the successful course. Late Edition 's TonyBlankley declared that the China issue is a debate between "activists" and"experts," making clear he prefers the experts. "Most experts recognize thatthere is a relatively small zone of policy dispute," he said.            The latest Campaigngate anglegot chewed over with the revelation that the White House had leaned onSecretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt to benefit one set of Indians overanother regarding permission to build a(nother) gambling casino. Consensus:This is a big deal, definitely special-prosecutor material. On Fox NewsSunday , Brit Hume predicted that the Democrats' "everybody does it" spinwill be unspun by Bob Dole, who just volunteered to appear before the Thompsoncommittee, challenging Clinton to do the same. On Face the Nation ,Chairman Fred Thompson fended off Bob Schieffer's suggestion that the presidentmight be guilty of obstructing justice. Thompson graciously attributed theadministration's late delivery of subpoenaed documents to the president's"sophisticated litigators," who know how to slow the process down.                           Washington Week in Review devoted the show to Campaigngate, with fivetalking heads bobbing in unison for a half hour on the deplorable state ofaffairs. The "cynicism is reaching a new level," said the dependably earnestBob Woodward. Robert Novak ventured on Meet the Press that a newcampaign-finance law would pass before the end of the year. David Broder andLisa Myers reacted like he was nuts.            Microsoft Executive Vice President SteveBallmer appeared on This Week to explain that everything Microsoft does,it does for consumers. "We need to innovate," he said eight times if he said itonce. On Fox News Sunday , Hume (a part-time computer columnist) andNPR's Mara Liasson concurred with Ballmer, citing the market's right todetermine winners. Juan Williams ( Fox News Sunday ) and Sam Donaldson( This Week ) painted Microsoft as a company that rules with an "ironfist" (Donaldson).            While there was plenty oftime on the weekend shows to palaver about Hillary Clinton's emergingchild-care initiative (and her 50 th birthday), the Asianstock-market crash, and the reform of the IRS, the shows were silent about theMillion Woman March. This was odd, seeing as each show makes it a point to havea female panelist. Maybe the march's organizers should have held theirdemonstration in Washington, where the pundits live, instead of inPhiladelphia.                           Uncomfortable Truth :Both Washington Week 's Ken Bode and Fox News Sunday host TonySnow noted the death of ace White House reporter Ann Devroy of theWashington Post in their wrap-ups, but only Fox News Sundaypanelist Williams was willing to disturb the dead in journalistic fashion,saying Devroy "shouldn't have chain-smoked."                           --JackShafer
