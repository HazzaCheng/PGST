                                 Nothing Like a Dane            The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with the resumption in Washington this week of Israel-Syriapeace talks. Both papers emphasize that prospects for an end to the 51-yearstate of war between the two countries are excellent. The New York Times leads with a U.S.surgeon general's report, to be released today, stating that although in anygiven year one in five Americans experiences a mental disorder and that half ofall Americans do so at least once in the course of their lives, most never seektreatment. USA Today goes with the Census Bureau's release today of aspecial edition of its annual statistical abstract of the U.S. that offers asnapshot of how the country has changed during this century. Some examples: Inthe century's first decade, there were 2 million immigrants from Italy and50,000 from Mexico, and in its last, the numbers were approximately thereverse; America's air is 10 times as polluted today as in 1900; the populationof Buffalo is almost exactly the same as in 1900, while that of L.A. is about35 times larger. A NYT inside story on the abstract notes that two ofthe most popular girls' names in 1900 were Florence and Bertha, while today,neither is in the top 10,000.            The reporting on Israel-Syria makes it clear that the most sensitive issuesto be hashed out are whether Israel will keep an intelligence-gathering post inthe Golan Heights and its access to the Sea of Galilee. The WP accountstates that in the run-up to last week's announcement of the talks, the U.S.engaged in much secret diplomacy, including a dozen phone calls betweenPresident Clinton and Syria's Hafez Assad. Last week, the LAT reportedthat Yasser Arafat was not pleased by the Israel-Syria thaw, but today'sLAT doesn't follow up on this.            The NYT says the surgeon general's report finds that most people with mentaldisorders don't get help because they don't think effective treatments exist,or they fear being stigmatized, or because they lack applicable insurance. Thereport endorses, says the paper, equality between mental health insurancecoverage and that for physical illnesses and claims that such a coverageincrease needn't be costly.            The LAT is alone in fronting the International Olympic Committee'sweekend reaction to the past year's 2002 Winter Games bribery scandal: votingin a reform package designed to restore the IOC's reputation. The package'smost prominent measure is a ban on members' visits to bidding cities. The storyquotes IOC chairman Juan Antonio Samaranch as saying the vote means the problemis solved, but it also notes that the House of Representatives will bequestioning him this week at hearings looking into Olympic corruption. Inaddition, says the LAT , a DOJ investigation continues.            A WP front-page in-depther on Bill Bradley, second in a series, portrays him as drivenand insecure as a young scholar-athlete. The story says that as a Knick, heroutinely held on to an opposing player's shorts and even garners a quote fromthe man 26 years later: "He was one of the dirtiest players I ever playedagainst." (And the story also relates that at Princeton, Bradley dated DianeSawyer, seriously enough that she and her parents visited his house overChristmas one year. Neither Bradley nor Sawyer would comment to the Postabout the romance.) Meanwhile, on the USAT front Barbara Bush mounts adefense of George W.'s gravitas: "People don't know that he is a very smarthistory buff and that's what he reads." (For                   Slate               'stake on another aspect of GWB's persona clickhere.)            Sunday's NYT "Week in Review" confuses with a graphic about "SaturdayNight Specials." The text says they are a favorite among criminals, but thestats go the other way: one box shows that SNSs only account for about 15percent of all guns traced to crimes, and another shows that five of the ninemodels with the shortest time-in-existence-before-use-in-a-crime are notSNSs. In other words, it's clear from all this that "good" guns are more of aproblem.                           We remember when "Gilded Age" was just an expression: TheWall Street Journal front reports a "microtrend" inmen's fashion: weaving gold into suits.                           USAT reports that the U.S. is the third happiest country in theworld. No. 2 is Australia, and No. 1 is Denmark.
