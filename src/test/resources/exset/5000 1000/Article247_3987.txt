                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        Sometimes it's worth remembering that the everyday business of Wall Street,even in these bull-market days, is quite mundane. And I'm not talking justabout the brokers and traders who are still out there trying to hit that bidfor 50,000 shares at $60. I'm also talking about the analysts, like the SalomonSmith Barney analyst who today started coverage of General Motors with a "hold"recommendation. Think of it. Why General Motors right now? And starting it witha hold? It's like a restaurant critic who's forced to specialize in differentgradations of bland. Or a movie reviewer spending his time explaining whyMusic of the Heart got two stars instead of one and a half. Or ... but Iprattle on.            Anyway, the big news of the week was, of course, the Microsoft decision,except that the big news was how little news the decision made on Wall Street,at least in terms of moving the market as a whole or even the company's stock,which now stands only a point or so below where it was when Judge Jacksonhanded down his ruling. Actually, the decision did help Microsoft'scompetitors, including especially the Linux companies. Apparently something cansimultaneously be unimportant to a company and incredibly important to thecompanies it's competing against. It's the inscrutable wisdom of the market.And so, on to Cocktail Chat.            1. "In a truly phenomenal decision , the Delaware Chancery Courtordered three top executives at Computer Associates to                   give back 9.5million shares of stock worth $558 million. And 'I already spent it onPokmon cards' will not be an acceptable defense."            2. "Priceline.com introduced its newest and most baffling innovation .You can now offer bids on the price of groceries. Airlines make seats availableto Priceline because they're perishable commodities--if no one uses them,they're a total loss--and hotels do the same with empty rooms. So what itemsare grocery stores going to make available? Day-old-bread, batteries thatare about to expire, and mystery meat? Well. This is going to be big. Reallybig."            3. "The Sci-Fi Channel announced that it will begin broadcasting aweekday talk show with medium John Edward, who is 'known for his uncannyability to see dead people .' (Just like the kid in The Sixth Sense .)Variety said Sci-Fi was hoping to 'appeal to viewers who are notnecessarily believers of the occult.' Apparently only if the show featuredsomeone who could actually raise the dead would it appeal to believersin the occult."            4. "On its opening day of trading , Cobalt Networks saw its sharesbetter than quintuple, rising from $22 to $128 . In otherwords, Cobalt went from being a micro-cap stock to a mid-cap stock in the spaceof six hours."            5. "In what was touted as a major vote of confidence by investors in the newdirection being taken by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the company raised $721million in a successful stock rights offering that allowed currentshareholders to buy additional shares at a discount. MGM said 99.3 percent ofits shareholders exercised their rights. Of course, 89 percent of MGMis owned by Kirk Kerkorian , who exercised all his rights. So whatreally happened is that Kerkorian gave MGM another $650 million to play with.But I suppose that is a vote of confidence of sorts."            6. "Citing attorney-client privilege, Sunbeam is refusing to turn over tothe SEC a report by Skadden Arps on the company's financial woes, despitethe fact that the SEC has subpoenaed the information . Perhaps by thetime it surfaces, there will be 18 pages missing from it."            7. "Amazon.com's stock rose more than 15 percent after it announcedMonday that it would be holding a press conference Tuesday to disclose majornew initiatives . Then it fell almost the same 15 percent Tuesday afterit actually held the press conference. One wonders what would have happened ifat the press conference it had only announced that it would be holding anotherpress conference the next day."
