                                 Still the One                           USAToday , the Washington Post , and the New York Timeslead with the illegal gifts acquittal of Mike Espy, the first ClintonAdministration Secretary of Agriculture. The story is also the top nationalstory at the Los Angeles Times . Pictures of a happy Espy adorn theNYT and WP tops.            Independent counsel Donald Smaltz had prosecuted Espy--and the papers allhold that the not guilty verdict fuels a growing consensus that the statuteunder which the likes of Smaltz and Kenneth Starr operate must be at the veryleast substantially amended. Referring to Espy's own remarks, all the papersraise the question of the ineffectiveness of the OIC by mentioning that thenon-conviction took four years and cost $17 million. Nobody mentions that Starris on the verge of a similar low-bang-for-the-buck result, but the thought isinescapable. The NYT quotes Espy saying that when Congress holdshearings on the IC statute, "I would like to be the first witness."            Since there is no dispute that Espy received some $35,000 worth of goods andbennies from parties with interests before Agriculture and since some of thoseparties pleaded guilty to making illegal gifts, it's easy for the reader towonder how the clean-sweep verdict was possible. The NYT and LATdo a good job of laying out the legal complications: both explain that the usualrules don't apply if the gift giver has a prior personal relationship with thegiftee, and the NYT also notes that the courts are still struggling withwhether or not the illegal gratuity statute requires a concrete quid pro quo(either past or promised). There could have been another factor, which theLAT gets into far more than the others: race. The top half of thepaper's story explains that Espy is black as were 11 of the jurors and that atone point, Smaltz asked the judge to tell jurors that race could not be takeninto account in deciding the case. Which, the LAT adds, he declined todo. USAT doesn't mention the racial composition of the jury until thethird-to-last paragraph. The WP waits until the second-to-last. TheNYT never mentions it.            And none of the papers mentions the oddity of a Secretary of Agricultureleading a continent-hopping lifestyle that included trips to the U.S. Open, andDallas Cowboy and Chicago Bull home games and a taste for expensive luggage andcrystal.            Word comes today that President Clinton's lawyers intend to appear beforethe House Judiciary Committee to offer a vigorous defense of their client, whowill not appear. The story off-leads at the WP , but in a sure sign ofscandal fatigue, it's below the fold at USAT and the LAT , andruns inside at the NYT .            According to the WP , executives at Mobil and Exxon forgot one thingwhile they were crafting their merger into the world's largest corporation: toregister their new corporate Internet address. And yesterday, the two companiesdiscovered that a Korean entrepreneur with no connections to them had beatenthem to it. Such "cyber-squatting" is legal and can be quite profitable.For instance, notes the Post , earlier this year, Compaq paid $3 millionto secure "Altavista.com" from a squatter.            The Wall Street Journal reports that the chief economist of theConference Board says next year, Europe could overtake the U.S. as the world'sstrongest economy. She thinks that while the U.S. economy will continue to growhealthily, Europe has more unused capacity than the U.S. and its interest ratesare comparable or lower. The only big question is whether the move to the eurocommon currency will create service jobs, the sector where Europe still clearlylags behind the U.S.            If you think the Clinton scandal has dragged on and on, consider this insideWP story: Yesterday, lawyers for Richard Nixon's estate demanded up to$213 million in compensation for the government's Watergate-related seizure ofNixon's tapes and papers. The lawyers compared the value of the tapes to thatof the Gutenberg Bible and the Declaration of Independence.
