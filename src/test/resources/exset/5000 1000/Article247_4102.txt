                                 Nattering Nabob of Solipsism                        Tucker:            Hmmph. And I feared the whole subject of children's books was a littlelowbrow for the Breakfast Table. Maybe better for the Book Club ("Today in                  Slate               , Bob Herbert and Susan Sarandon on whether the feloniousmonkeys in Caps for Sale should be put to death."). One final word onGeorge and Martha, courtesy of my wife: James Marshall, the author of theseries, lived for a while in far West Texas, and he's buried in the tiny townof Marathon. So we're not all bad.            Didja see Safire today? Another one of his sommelier numbers, in which heremoves a candidate's cork and sniffs it in full view of the electorate. Whodied and made him the judge of a pol's worthiness? (For that matter, Tucker,who died and made us judge?) I don't mind his taking Bradley's foreign policyspeech apart: I appreciate his listening to it and analyzing it so I don't haveto (I would have had to find toothpicks to keep my eyes open), but the whole"oracle of wisdom" aspect to his approach is beginning to tick me off. When youread one of his columns these days, or at least when I do, you get the sensethat it's more about him than it is about it or them; the phrase "natteringnabob of solipsism" suddenly springs to mind. There's a great story about hisself-importance circulating down here in Austin. Do you remember a couple ofweeks ago when Safire wrote in two consecutive columns about coming to seeBush? As I understand it, he called Karen Hughes, Bush's communicationsdirector, on, like, a Thursday, and said, "I'm coming Tuesday." Not "Can Icome?" but "I'm coming." Karen supposedly said, "Well, the governor's going tobe out of town," to which Safire responded, "No, you don't understand, I'mcoming Tuesday." P.S., Bush changed his schedule. Can you imagine David Broderpulling that crap? If the story's true, it lends credence to a theory I haveabout Safire. My daughter and I were watching The Wizard of Oz over theholidays (which I'm sure Team Carlson wasn't, since it was on TV), and itoccurred to me that there's a bit of Oz in Safire: He seems all-powerful andscary, someone you have to bow before to curry favor, but when you pull thecurtain back he's just a nebbishy guy who used to write speeches for Nixon. Ifthings had gone differently, he could be the Reform Party frontrunner and PatBuchanan could be doing a twice-weekly column called--what? "HeilEverybody"?            If Safire were Oz, what would he give the various Republican candidatesbefore tonight's debate? A brain for Bush. (Sorry, Karen, couldn't resist.) Aheart for Alan Keyes. A chill pill for McCain, since he obviously doesn't needcourage. And how's about self-awareness for Orrin Hatch, who's at leastpretending that he has a chance in hell of breaking the 1 percent threshold ina state other than Utah? I thought, actually, we might spend some time todaytalking about the debate, which I fear is going to be unnatural andunrevealing. It's not like we're going to learn anything about these guys otherthan who prepped well and who's prone to flop sweat under the klieg lights. Iknow I sound like Nick Lemann, but it's about as accurate a measure of trueintelligence as the SAT; idiots make the Ivy League, so why not the WhiteHouse? In a real crisis--say, a nuclear conflict with Russia--no president willhave spent four days debating a stand-in for Yelstin. Rather than test thecandidates in such a formal setting, we ought to catch them off-guard. Life isoff-guard, right? But then we're getting dangerously close to the realm of thepop quiz, and we all know where that got us last time.            Before I go, I want to revise and extend my remarks about Drudge: Thismorning he has not one but two links to stories about the Clintons' personallives. One says Hillary's going to use her maiden name in her Senate bid, andthe other says Hillary and Bill are going to divorce the minute he's out ofoffice. Drudge teases each by saying they come from a "paper," but when youclick on the link, you learn they come from a supermarket tab Star andNational Enquirer , respectively. Next he'll be linking us to theWeekly World News . The Hartford Courant was right: Drudge istoast.            Regards,Evan
