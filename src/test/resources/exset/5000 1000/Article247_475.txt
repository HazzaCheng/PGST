                                 Freeh at Last            At the Washington Post and USA Today thelead is Janet Reno and Louis Freeh's joint appearance before a congressionalcommittee. The Los Angeles Times leads with the news that California airquality officials are considering imposing stricter smog rules on pick-uptrucks and minivans. And the New York Timesgoes with the South Korean government's call for the U.S. and Japan to quicklypony up some cash that has been promised in the recently concluded bailout onlyas a last resort (yet another case of the Times leading with a financialstory nobody else even puts on the front page). Within hours, Clintonadministration officials rejected any early injection of U.S. funds. There wasno immediate reaction from Japan. There's politics on both sides of the matter,says the Times : Korean politicians want up-front money to soften whatare widely viewed in their country as the bailout's regulatory intrusions,while the Clinton administration has tried to make the U.S. contribution to thedeal--estimated to be potentially $5 billion--more palatable by suggestingthere's a chance it would never actually be needed.                           USAT stresses the "unified front" put on by Reno and Freeh on theHill (as does the LAT in its front pager), while the WPemphasizes Freeh's testimony that he continues to support an independentcounsel taking over Justice's ongoing investigation of Clinton campaignfund-raising. The Post notes that while Reno has spent a lot of time infront of congressional mikes, yesterday's appearance marked Freeh's firstextensive public comments concerning the investigation and his disagreementwith Reno about how to pursue it. He is quoted describing that disagreement as"the biggest open secret in Washington" because of leaks tonews organizations. Probably so, but Freeh had as much motive as anyone to dothe leaking: publicizing the dispute served to demonstrate his politicalindependence from Clinton, something Reno has been pilloried repeatedly for notdemonstrating (see, for instance, today'sMaureen Dowd column).            The context for the LAT lead is that the boom in light trucks and sport utilityvehicles has accelerated pollution because they aren't subject to the sameemission and fuel economy controls as passenger cars. An editorial in theNYT points out that even though these heavier vehicles are only half asnumerous as cars, they already produce as much carbon dioxide, and by 2010 ifthe rules aren't changed, they may produce up to 75 percent of all smog comingfrom personal vehicles.            Although even the United Farm Workers considers the strike against tablegrapes to be "dormant," until last Thursday it was still going strong, reportsthe Wall Street Journal , at Harvard. That's when theresults of a campus-wide referendum were announced: 54% percent pro-grape, 46%anti. There will be grapes on campus tables for brunch this Sunday. Someanti-grape students are planning a no-grape eating table.            The Journal 's "Tax Report" brings word that some rock stars have been tanglingwith the IRS over the deductibility of clothes worn on stage duringperformances. Apparently, Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac told the governmentthat her flowing on-stage get-ups are not suitable for ordinary wear, and thatmuch of it is discarded after shows because it can't be re-used. The columnreports that a tentative settlement between Nicks and the feds is in theworks.            The WP front page reports that Latrell Sprewell held a press conference yesterday. Heapologized, but his main goal was image repair: he was accompanied, says thePost , by his agent, his accountant, his tax man, his teammates, thepresident of the players' union, several other advisors, and....JohnnieCochran. Sprewell took no questions from the assembled press and did notaddress any specifics of the two incidents in which he punched and choked hiscoach. "We're not here today to discuss the facts," Cochran explained. No wordyet on the search for the real chokers.
