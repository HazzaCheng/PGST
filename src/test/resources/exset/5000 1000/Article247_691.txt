                                 Vici, Veni, Video                           USAToday and the Los Angeles Times lead with congressional Republicans' pushto release to the public the video of President Clinton's grand jury testimony.At the Washington Post , where the lead is local primary results,the video is the top national story. At the New York Times ,state and local election returns lead, and the top national story is furtherpolling indicating that although the American people are increasingly dubiousabout Clinton's moral character, most still don't think he should be impeachedor forced to resign.            According to USAT , Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee--whoare in the majority there--will vote either today or Thursday to make the video(and other evidence Ken Starr turned over) public. The paper explains thatalthough grand jury testimony must be kept secret, Congress is not covered bythat restriction. USAT says that release would mean the videotape couldbe airing on TV this weekend. (Last weekend, the book, this weekend, the movie.Next weekend--scratch and sniff?)            The LAT lead stresses the rancor inside the committee the video hascaused, calling Democrats "infuriated." The LAT , WP and afront-page NYT story cite Clinton's behavior on the tape as the reasonfor concern: there are times in his testimony when, says the LAT ,Clinton "reacted angrily," and is "visibly upset." The NYT says thepresident "even erupted at a couple of points" (Note to reader: Insert own jokehere). He is also, says the NYT , shown repeatedly refusing to answersome questions. The Post quotes the assessment of a congressional aidefamiliar with the tape: "devastating."            The WP says that censure is losing ground among Republicanbigfeet--not a serious enough punishment, they say. And the LAT leadreports that at a meeting between Senate Democrats and White House staffers, atleast one lawmaker said Clinton should consider resigning. The WPreports that at that meeting, Sen. Joseph Biden said Democrats might be betteroff if Clinton resigned, but Biden emphasized then and later that he wasn'turging resignation. The NYT has a similar account of Biden's remark. TheLAT says two other Senators besides the one at the meeting privatelytold the paper that Clinton should step down.            A sense of what should be engaging the country more than all of this comeswith a reading of today's WP editorial about the current situation in Serbia .Various diplomats are quoted claiming that Serbian troops under the command ofSlobodan Milosevic have shot many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, and through ascorched-earth policy are fixing to let many more--hundreds ofthousands--starve to death. This disaster cannot be ended, writes thePost , without U.S. resolve to use force, resolve that, the paper notes,has been altogether missing from the Clinton administration. "The longer Mr.Clinton dithers," the editorial concludes, "the greater the costs will be."            The NYT reports that a number of economists say that some of theAsian countries hardest hit by the region's economic crisis are now in adepression, meaning of a much longer duration and with much more unemploymentthan a recession. Cited are Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong andMalaysia. Japan, while not in a depression yet, is, reports the Times ,in its worst recession since WWII.            Reading the various obituaries, it's been hard to know what to finally makeof George Wallace. Was his late-in-life outreach to blacks genuine or a selfishbit of pre-obit cosmetics? Today's NYT op-ed page brings the assessment of Rep. John Lewis, a giant of the civil rightsmovement, who was seriously injured by Wallace's thuggy troops at Selma. Lewissays that "Wallace deserves recognition for seeking redemption for hismistakes, for his willingness to change and to set things right with those heharmed and with his God."            The main Wall Street Journal "Politics and Policy" piece reportsthat the moderate "New Democrat" wing of the party, with its "values agenda" ofsuch issues as V-chips for TVs, more family leave and increased parentalresponsibility, is feeling particularly betrayed by President Clinton. AHarvard theorist of the wing does note however, "The fact of the matter is, theNew Democrats never had an adultery position...."
