                                 Why <i>Who Wants To Be a Millionaire</i> Is a Hit                        The most important thing that's changed about the major TV networks in thelast few years, aside from their steadily shrinking share of the audience, isthat more and more of their programming is "reality-based." On the one hand,you have the continued proliferation of the too-scary-to-be-fictional genre,which was pioneered by Fox and exemplified by When Animals Attack andWorld's Scariest Car Chases . At the same time, more and more of thenetworks' schedules are occupied by news shows--which generally have at least aloose connection to reality--such as Dateline . And although America'sFunniest Home Videos is no longer provoking belly laughs across thecountry, variants thereof air regularly as specials.            The great virtue of reality-based programming is that it's relativelyinexpensive to produce, since very little of the material needs to be paid for.And for people who are supposedly obsessed with celebrities, Americans seemremarkably interested in what other "real" people are doing--as long as whatthey're doing involves either being chased down with 40 vials of crack,fighting a long illness, driving the wrong way on a freeway, or getting upendedoff a ladder by an overly friendly springer spaniel. (Wasn't that a greatsegment?)            Perhaps as a result of its success, though, "reality-based programming" isnow being used as a label to cover shows that are, well, not real, like thehuge hit game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and its recentsuccessful competitor Greed . Millionaire has picked up where itleft off this summer, dominating its time slot and actually casting a slighthalo effect on its ABC peers, while Greed has been one of the only--OK,the only--bright spot in a disappointing fall season. It's their successthat prompted a recent headline in Variety proclaiming "Nets ReapRatings From Reality Shows."            What's odd about this is that game shows--even if they're not fixed likethey were in the '50s--are real only in a very tenuous sense. Thoroughly stagedand stage-managed, they're dramatic, or perhaps melodramatic, precisely becauseof the artificial structure of their formats. We don't, it's true, know how anygiven episode of Millionaire is going to turn out, and even though onemight say the same about a forthcoming episode of ER , the fact that intheory no one knows how the Millionaire episode is going to turnout may make it more real.            But Millionaire and Greed are to Cops and WhenAnimals Attack as the zoo is to the Serengeti Plain, offering a kind ofsemblance of uncertainty (and, therefore, reality) instead of the actual thing,whatever that might be. In part, the actual thing is just the possibility thatsomething genuinely unexpected is going to happen--who knew that deer couldbeat down hunters with their front hooves?--but in part, especially with a showlike Cops , it's the possibility that nothing especially important isgoing to happen. Millionaire , by contrast, is circumscribed in bothdirections. You know it'll be exciting but not too surprising, and you know itwon't be too surprising but also not dull.            Game shows do have many of the same advantages as true reality-basedprogramming--relatively low production cost, endless supply of material--andsome others in addition, including the ability to keep Chuck Woolery off thedole. And the fact that TV viewers would rather spend prime time watching anot-so-great-looking guy answer questions about the Great Lakes than watchinggorgeous twentysomethings pretend to be teen-agers has to count for something.But only in a world as totally hermetic as that of TV production would gameshows count as real . Next we'll probably hear that Felicitycounts as real, too, since the people saying their lines on the show are actualhuman beings who are actually saying the words.            Sounds good to me.
