                                 The <i>L.A. Times</i>' Baffling Economics            Yet another staff petition is circulating at the Los Angeles Timesconcerning publisher Kathryn Downing's idiotic decision to share advertisingrevenue from the special issue of the Times Sunday magazine about LosAngeles' new Staples Center arena with ... the Staples Center. (This novelarrangement was made known a couple of weeks ago by New Times L.A. ) An earlier staff petition protested thearrangement as a violation of journalistic ethics, and last week prompted fromDowning 1) a bizarre apology in which she admitted she didn't know much abouthow newspapers work; and 2) a refusal to resign.            The new petition, dated Nov. 2 and addressed to L.A. Times editorMichael Parks (who has said he didn't know of the financial relationship anddoes not approve of it), urges Parks to publish a lengthy investigation in thepaper of how the Staples fiasco occurred:                                             One of the most important steps the Times can take is to publishin its own pages a thorough examination of the events that led to the Staplesdeal. The Times owes nothing less to its readers and to itsstaff.                              Others have written about the Staples controversy and will continue to doso. We need to do the definitive piece and do it first--not have it dribble outin other places.                        The petition cites as the main precedent for such an investigation DonaldBarlett and James Steele's Philadelphia Inquirer investigation of LauraForeman in the late 1970s. (Foreman was a political writer at theInquirer who had an affair with a local pol while covering localpolitics for the paper.) The Times petition is signed by many importantpeople at the paper, including city editor Bill Boyarsky, Washington bureauchief Doyle McManus, and such prominent L.A. Times writers and reportersas Kenneth Turan, Howard Rosenberg, Bob Drogin, and Sam Fulwood. (Chatterboxsuspects other names have been added to the list since he acquired a copy.)            The petitioners have a good idea, and not just because it might cost Downing(and maybe even Mark "Captain Crunch" Willes, the Times Mirror chief whose talkof more cooperation between the business and news departments of the newspaperprobably led to this fiasco) their jobs. There remain many unanswered questionsabout the Staples deal, of which the "journalism ethics" question is onlyone--and perhaps the least interesting. Why did the L.A. Times think itsStaples deal was smart from a business perspective? According to thesketchy information available (some of it from the L.A. Times ' ownlimited coverage; click here for the best piece), the deal was as follows: The L.A.Times , which for all practical purposes enjoys monopoly status in LosAngeles, is paying the Staples Center, which desperately needs publicity fromthe L.A. Times , somewhere between $2 million and $3 million annually.(The ad revenue from the special issue of the L.A. Times magazine thatthe Times handed over to the Staples Center apparently was a downpayment on these dues.) In exchange, the L.A. Times is getting a bunchof ad signs posted inside and outside the Staples Center; the right to sellcopies of its newspaper inside the arena; and its own "luxury suite" (i.e.,skybox). The right to sell copies of the L.A. Times in the StaplesCenter is surely of negligible value. Chatterbox suspects the same is true ofthe ad signs; but even if there's stupendous value in the TV exposure thatresults, it's hard to see how the ads could be worth more than $500,000. (InPhiladelphia's Veterans Stadium, a 48-foot ad over the center-field seatscurrently costs at most $300,000 per season.) The skybox is probably necessaryto pamper advertisers; but if the Times had simply rented its own likemost corporations, the annual cost would apparently have been at most $300,000a year, according to the L.A. Times ' RoyRivenburg. This suggests that, instead of paying $2 million to $3 millionper year to the Staples Center, Downing should be paying something under $1million.            An irony in all this is that the real way to make money off theStaples Center would have been to pander to advertisers with a special issue ofthe L.A. Times magazine (which the Times did) and notshare the stupendous proceeds--reportedly $2 million--with the Staples Center,but rather, to keep it all. Chatterbox doesn't expect Captain Crunch andhis minions to understand journalism; but don't they understand how to make abuck?
