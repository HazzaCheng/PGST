                                 Taking Stock in America            The top story at USAT, the NYT and the WP is Benjamin Netanyahu's home-frontpolitical battles arising from his just-signed peace deal with Yasser Arafat.This is also played above the fold at the LAT, which leads with the paper's ownstudy revealing that despite being the most populous state, California stands31st in per capita share of federal education spending.            The papers report that as soon as his plane landed in Israel, Netanyahubegan vigorously defending the Wye deal with Arafat. According to the coverage,he portrayed the agreement as his success at getting the very best possible outof the land-for-security Oslo peace process he inherited from his Laborpredecessors. Everybody quotes him saying, "We have closed the holes of theSwiss cheese created by Oslo." The NYT quotes his direct pitch tomilitant Israeli settlers: "You are us and we are you. We love you."Koo-koo-ka-choob.            The NYT and WP say Netanyahu could face a no-confidence votethis week, while the LAT doesn't give a time frame, and USAT saysit's today. In view of the no-confidence threat, the WP notes the oddityof Netanyahu's Labor slam, since it's the doves who may save his government,with conservative settlers expressing great disaffection. All this politicalintrigue, even though, as the papers report, about three-quarters of allIsraelis approve of the accord.            The NYT and LAT include in their lead stories reporting onunrest among the Palestinians as well. The two papers note that violent clashesbroke out in the Palestinian-controlled city of Ramallah, resulting in thedeath of one Fatah member, after Palestinian security forces, pursuant to thenew agreement, raided the Fatah headquarters there, confiscating documents andweapons and making five arrests." The NYT notes that Palestinianlawmaker Hanan Ashrawi was a witness to the death, but the WP quotes heronly on the general political situation and doesn't seem to know aboutthis.            The NYT front continues the sprawling series on adoption it startedyesterday. One of the main points of today's installment is that the demand forwhite American-born infants is so great that even though it is not legal to bidon or buy an adopted child, there has arisen an entire network ofadoption-related intermediaries who sell various kinds of access tochild-bearing women. In effect, the paper states, today there is only thethinnest line between buying adoption services and buying a child.            The story of the upstate New York abortion doctor murdered in his homecontinues to garner a lot of coverage. The LAT runs a front-pageencomium, while the WP reports inside that for quite some time, he hadreceived phone and written threats. The NYT reports on the manhunt forthe sniper and also that the Georgia-based computer programmer who hosts ananti-abortion web site called "The Nuremberg Files," where the doctor's namehad a line drawn through it shortly after he was murdered, denies any advanceinformation about the shooting. The NYT lead editorial has this reactionto the crime: "If an armed police officer has to be stationed outside everyabortion provider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be done."            It's well-known that convicts paper the legal system with suits, briefs andmotions to spring themselves, but a WSJ front-page feature reports on aprisoner who has put the same kind of energy into stockholder suits and makes adecent income from it. Over the past three years, says the Journal , oneconvicted tax cheat has taken in more than $30,000 making (dubious) allegationsof stockholder fraud against various corporations. All this without owning anystock in any of the companies.            In the aftermath of the recent revelation that a celebrated 19-year-oldwriter on "Felicity" is actually thirty-two, the LAT front reports thataccording to a new study from the West Coast branch of the movie and TV writersunion, writers under age thirty--most of them white males--are increasinglydominating TV and movies. Since it is obvious that studios will want toimmediately correct this grievous social injustice, Today's Papers feelscompelled to confess that it is a black woman over fifty.
