                                 Un-Free Willy            Everybody leads with Kenneth Starr's sudden delivery to Congress yesterday afternoon of hisreport claiming there is substantial evidence that President Clinton, inhis behavior relating to his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, committedcrimes that may be impeachable offenses. "The fate of the Clinton presidency,"says the Wall Street Journal , is now in Congress' hands. Theheadlines at the Los Angeles Times , USA Today ,and the New York Timesall include the word "impeachment." The Washington Post front gives itself over most completely tothe development, but its headlines omit the I-word. Perhaps quite by accidentor perhaps with full subversive intent, a headline over another WPfront-page story--about the return of a certain movie killer whale to the highseas--sends an ominous message, though: "A Whale of an Ending for 'Willy'".            The WP and NYT speak somewhat vaguely of the report'sallegations of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power. USATis more concrete, saying that according to a "lawyer with knowledge of thereport," Starr's 445-page effort--shipped over with supporting documents induplicate in 36 sealed boxes--flatly concludes that Clinton perjured himselftwice, once in his Jones case deposition and once in his videotaped grand jurytestimony. In addition, the paper says the report finds that Clinton's effortsto find Lewinsky a job were obstruction of justice. The LAT is alsosomewhat detailed, quoting "one legal source" (hmmm...wonder if he's A LawyerWith Knowledge Of The Report?) as agreeing that perjury is charged, andelaborating that the charge arises from Clinton's denial of sex with Lewinskyand for claiming he could not remember being alone with her except when she wasdelivering papers to him.            The WSJ says the report also alleges that attempts by Vernon Jordanto find Lewinsky a job were aimed at keeping her silent. USAT says theStarr report sees no wrongdoing in Jordan's efforts. The Journal quotes"allies of Mr. Starr" as saying that the report includes many heretoforeunreleased details that will "surprise the public." Everybody notes the reportis sitting in a locked House storage room while the congressional leadershipdecides how to proceed. The NYT and USAT say the report could bemade public Friday. USAT says this might include Internet access.            The WP detects "a rising sense of helplessness" at the White House.The WSJ and LAT report that on the heels of yesterday's apologysession with House leaders, President Clinton will today offer more of the sameto Senate Democrats and his Cabinet. The NYT says Clinton was "sad,somber and choked up" at the Wednesday session. The Journal says thatill feeling towards the president among pols is "pervasive." Everybody reportsanother Clinton apology Wednesday, delivered at a public appearance in Florida.The LAT says he was "husky-voiced and somber" for that one. (It turnsout that sex means always having to say you're sorry.)            There's other news today: The NYT reports that the Communists are threatening Boris Yeltsin with impeachmentif he renominates Viktor Chernomyrdin to be his prime minister (a story firstbroached earlier in the week by the LAT ); the WP and NYTreport that government security guards in Beijing brutally hauled away the wife of a jailed dissident to keepher from delivering a letter of protest to the visiting U.N. commissioner onhuman rights. (She was released several hours later.) The WP reportsthat U.S. investigators have focused in on a rural truck repair facility as the likely staging area forthe Tanzania embassy bombing.            And then there's intrepid WP reporter Libby Ingrid Copeland'stireless 575-word effort to discover things that have the same circumference asMark McGwire's arms. Such as: D.C. parking meters, personal pan pizzas, atwo-year-old's head, a twenty-three-old woman's thigh. Things that fall short:Several male-in-the-street biceps, including those of an unnamed reporter, acoffee cup. All this and a quote from Louis Farrakhan too.
