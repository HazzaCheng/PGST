The Daily RecordTowson Attorney Designs Project to Benefit Legal AidEarl KellyFriday, December 6, 2002Lawyer Eliot M. Wagonheim of Towson has designed a project thatwill benefit two Baltimore County law-related organizations andestablish a fund for helping area firefighters who becomedisabled.Wagonheim said the program not only will benefit the needy, butalso will help improve the public image of lawyers."It not only raises money for charity," he said, "but givespeople something else to think about the next time they hear alawyer joke."Called Take 2, the endeavor will be funded by attorneys whodonate either 2 percent of their earnings or $2 for each billablehour charged on Thursdays in March 2003. As for attorneys whohandle contingency cases or who are salaried, Wagonheim said theycould participate by donating some amount that approximated such adonation.Donors may earmark contributions to go to the Legal Aid Bureaufor use in Baltimore County, to charitable programs run by theBaltimore County Bar Foundation, or to benefit families offirefighters and rescue workers who are killed or injured.Wagonheim said he initially hoped to recruit about 300contributors for Take 2's first year, and projected donations ofupwards of $15,000.After contacting attorneys about Take 2, Wagonheim is beginningto revise his projections."The response has led me to believe its going to be much higherthan that," Wagonheim said. "I can't tell you how excited I am byit."Focal PointWagonheim has experience in creating charitable endeavors. Hewas one of the organizers of the now-famous Chesapeake BluesFestival, an event held each Year since 1998 at Sandy Point StatePark outside Annapolis for the benefit of several charities.But Wagonheim eschewed the publicity."I really hope the focus won't be on me doing charity work butwill be on Take 2," said Wagonheim, who added that Baltimore CountyBar Association President Stephen J. Nolan was instrumental inlaunching the new program.Nolan said of Take 2, "Lawyers individually are doing a lot forthe community, and this is one way we can channel our efforts."Wilhelm H. Joseph Jr., executive director of the Legal AidBureau, which helps fund legal services for the poor in civilmatters, said that Take 2 "is not charity. It's about theprofessional responsibility of each individual lawyer and the BarAssociation."The Take 2 initiative will reach well beyond the legalprofession and serve members of the broader community.Baltimore County firefighters do not have a formal program toprovide a financial boost to firefighters and paramedics who areinjured and unable to work.This shortcoming became evident following terrorist attacks onthe World Trade Center in New York City, where firefighters havesuch a fund that helps members' families in times of need."Let's say a Baltimore County firefighter is from North Countyand they are injured and are in the shock trauma unit in Baltimorebut a family member can't commute from the Pennsylvania line,"Wagonheim said. "Right now, the firefighters will pass the hat andhelp raise money to put the family up, but there is no fund."Firefighter Michael R. Rehfeld, a ladder truck driver and17-year veteran of the force, was working to create such a fund,and Wagonheim heard of his efforts.Rehfeld, reached yesterday between emergency runs caused by theheavy snowfall, said critically injured firefighters and rescueworkers often must hire others, such as plumbers and yard workers,to help maintain their homes during periods of convalescence."We saw what happened up in New York and how much critical needthere was to establish this," Rehfeld said. "Take 2 is the startingpoint, and we hope to establish an endowment."Wagonheim, who teaches the professionalism course for theMaryland State Bar Association, said he is working with the MSBA tocreate a statewide Take 2-type program.Attorneys who want to participate in Take 2 may call theBaltimore County Bar Association at 410-337-9103 or contact theassociation at www.bcba.org or Wagonheim at www.wtlawfirm.com.
