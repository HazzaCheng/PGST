                                 Contenders and Pretenders                        The Iowa straw poll results--and the candidates' on-air reactions tothem--are Issue 1. (Unfortunately, about half the chat shows were taped beforethe vote.) The teaching of evolution in schools is a distant second.            The straw-poll verdict by the pundits is largely unanimous: Elizabeth Doleand Gary Bauer proved they can compete with George W. and Steve Forbes. All theother candidates proved they can't. The candidates seem to agree with thisverdict--even the losers. On NBC's Meet the Press , for example, LamarAlexander all but bows out of the race. Later in the program, Pat Buchananhints at bolting the party. (Tim Russert asks, "Will you pledge today that youwill support George W. Bush if he's the nominee?" Buchanan responds, "No--letme say this--uh, I don't know where I'm going to be in August of the year2000.") The only straw-poll loser determined to stay in is Dan Quayle, theformer vice president, who received fewer votes than Alan Keyes.            The pundits pronounce Dole and Bauer the biggest winners. Since Dole--withlittle money and a weak organization--had the most to lose, her third-placefinish gives her campaign a big boost (Susan Page, of CNN's LateEdition ; and George F. Will and George Stephanopoulos, of ABC's ThisWeek ). Bauer is now the candidate of the Christian right, say FoxNews                Sunday's Mara Liasson and Juan Williams. GeorgeStephanopoulos and Bill Kristol ( This Week ) argue that Bauer still hasto draw social conservatives away from Forbes to be truly competitive.            (On Late Edition , Dole and Bauer appear one after the other, andthe contrast is instructive. Asked about abortion and the George W.-cocainecontroversy, Dole waffles on both--giving nervous, have-it-both-ways responses.Bauer says confidently and directly that W. should answer the cocaine questionand that as president he would pose a litmus test for judges on abortion.)            Many pundits--including Kristol, Will, Page, and Late               Edition's Steve Roberts--predict Pat Buchanan will leave theRepublican party. (Will calls Buchanan "a cocked gun" at the GOP's head.)Everyone agrees Alexander and Quayle are toast, and some--such as Roberts andKristol--point out the irony that the winners in Iowa are relativelyinexperienced, while Alexander and Quayle are political veterans.            The commentariat expresses surprise at the straw poll's growth inimportance. Some--such as Stephanopoulos and Williams--attribute it to thefront-loaded primary season and the GOP's White House hunger. Fox News               Sunday's Bill O'Reilly and Tony Snow say the media attention it hasgenerated makes it important regardless. (In other words, it's importantbecause we say it is.)            A few programs touch on the Kansas school board decision not to require theteaching of evolution in schools. Kristol and Late                Edition'sTucker Carlson think the decision is not that unreasonable, since it doesn'tgive either creationism or evolution exclusivity. Roberts sees it as proof thatthe "purist wing" of the GOP is gaining strength, but Stephanopoulos points outthat, at the straw poll, none of the candidates would go near the topic (saveAlan Keyes).Know Your Rights               Fox News Sunday plugs what it claims to be a scoop on the campaignfinance scandal. In an interview to be aired Tuesday, Johnny Chung tells thenews program The O'Reilly Factor (Fox) that during the HouseGovernmental Reform Committee hearings into campaign finance (the "Burtonhearings"), a Democratic counsel to the committee sent Chung's attorney'sunsolicited documents detailing how to go about taking the FifthAmendment.                           Attorney General Health ReportTalking to Wolf Blitzer in the Late Edition studios, Janet Reno showsthe ravages of her Parkinson's Disease. Her mind is obviously as sharp as ever,but her arms shake uncontrollably throughout the interview and the microphonepicks up her hands spasmodically rustling against her papers on the interviewtable. As they talk about gun control, both she and Blitzer keep stealingglances at her hands' distracting gyrations.                           Bad Boy, Georgie!Asked on Late Edition about George W.'s repeated use of the F-word inhis Talk magazine interview, Gary Bauer quips, "I found that articlesurprising--[although] I'll leave it to Governor Bush to talk with his momabout the language he uses."
