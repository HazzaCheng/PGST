Responsesto Monday's question (No. 138)--"Scaly":                                       This winter the U.S.government is testing a new 1-to-5 rating system in Nebraska and Wyoming.Rating what?                        "Homosexuality.'Individuals rated 1 through 3 will be issued an identity card protecting themfrom violence,' said a spokesman. 'Fours and 5s? Well they're just asking forit.' "-- Beth Sherman                        "Adorableness of plainsstates' Jews."-- Jim O'Grady ( Katha Pollitt and Paul Tullishad similar answers.)            "Suitability as anunmarked grave site for Linda Tripp. Whoops! We mean, um, suitability as, um,landfills."-- Tim Carvell                        "Number of times per hourit would be appropriate to refer to Jack London's 'To Build a Fire.' "-- DougIngram                        "Fondness forunicameralism. Nebraska, of course, gets a '5.' "-- Adam Bonin                        Click for moreresponses.                           Randy'sWrap-Up                        Judging byyour responses, here's what we know about Nebraska and Wyoming--bad sex, badfood, bad teeth, bad weather. No, wait, that's what we knew yesterday aboutEngland, although it's not far off. The big difference seems to be thateveryone in England is gay, and everyone in Nebraska or Wyoming is eager tobeat the stuffing out of them. You would, however, receive an affectionatereception if you were a domestic animal--sorry again, the term preferred byanimal lovers is "date." Is bestiality, that perpetual urban smirk at rurallife, actually prevalent in Nebraska and Wyoming? Or, to put it another way, inthe sense of asking an entirely different question: Is it really a requirementof sophistication that a place provides good bookstores, movies, plays,museums, music, cuisines, and an opportunity for erotic and intellectualfreedom? As it turns out, yes. But be wary of feeling too proud of yourselfsimply for not living in Nebraska. The same boast can be made by anyone inKansas.                           Precipitate Answer                        Winter storms.            Accordingto CNN Headline News (the brisk alternative for those who find CNN's regularnews too prolix), the rating system is analogous to that used for hurricanes,with 1 a "minor inconvenience" and 5 "life threatening." The National WeatherService will evaluate the system in spring.                           LifeUnder Livingston--Augmented Quotations Extra                        (Each final sentence addedby "News Quiz.")            "It's a different driverat the same steering wheel with the same gas in the same car. He's a committedconservative. Any poor folk get in the road, he's gonna run 'emover."-- Rep . David Obey, D-Wis.                        "Livingston is aboutrunning the train on the tracks. Poor folk wander onto those tracks:Boom!"-- Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind.                        "You will still have apro-big business, very much pro-oil industry party, and it is still very much aSouthern party. This place will become much less cannibalistic and much less ofa snake pit. But the snake, though limbless, can drive a car or a train ormaybe a private jet or something right over any damn poor people who get in itsway."-- David Obey                                       FormatChange                        As of today, News Quizconverts to the Top 40 format so popular with the kids.
