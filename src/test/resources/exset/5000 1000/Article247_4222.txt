                                 Body and Soul                        Guys,            One last thing, if you can bear with me: I've been meaning all week to mountthe case for The Sixth Sense , a film audiences loved and critics liked,sortakinda, but seemed to worry about liking too much. In my opinion, TheSixth Sense is every bit as ambitious and provocative, and in some waysmore fully realized, than Three Kings . Let's start with the small giftsof this movie, the little things it attempts that so few American movies everbother with. The urban backdrop: Tak Fujimoto's sublimely subtle, atmosphericcinematography made Philadelphia look ancient, decadent, well-worn; rarely doesan American film setting feel so saturated with the past and teeming with thefootprints left by earlier generations. Then there's the low-key honesty aboutclass--the contrast between Bruce Willis's psychologist, a posterboy gentrifierin a townhouse stuffed with antiques, and the wonderful Toni Colette'sstruggling mom. With just a few quick strokes, writer-director M. N. Shyamalanpaints a totally authentic-feeling picture of yuppiedom--its decent intentions,complacency, and loneliness--and I didn't see a less whitewashed or sensationalportrait of working-class family life this year. (As opposed to the voyeuristicRosetta , where the camera pants after the poor heroine, cornering herlike a pig in a pen and treating her vulnerability as a turn-on--an occasionfor a kind of art-house porn.) As for the famous trick ending, it is not atrick so much as the solution to a problem the film has been posing all along.The film has such a fragmented point of view, it's like a rigorously worked-outcubist canvas, except that unlike a cubist, Shyamalan moves through thefragments to a new level of clarity. I may be jumping to conclusions based onthe fact that Shayamalan is Indian-American, but The Sixth Sense strikesme as philosophically rather complicated, and possibly in dialogue with somenon-Western ideas you don't get to see too often in films, unless they'reuttered in egregiously bad faith by a wisecracking, turban-wearing showboatlike Whoopi Goldberg or Robin Williams. Many critics felt that toward the end,the ghosts became too unthreatening, too adorable--and here I admit they had apoint. On the other hand, I don't think this was just pandering. Death iseverywhere in The Sixth Sense ; the point of the film, unusually wise fora blockbuster, is that death is inevitable, and not an enemy.            I wanted to thank you, David, for passing the piece byDaniel Menaker. It was as excellent as promised--and yet the pace of changethese days is quick. Even since he wrote that piece a few months ago, BeingJohn Malkovich has come out, and Boys Don't Cry , and a few othermovies which taken together suggest that breaking through to the real isno longer such a priority. Compared with these films, The Truman Show ,with its paranoid and simplistic pursuit of innocence, already feels 15 yearsold. In fact, the best films this year no longer placed much stock in realityat all. They leapt into gray areas, where human beings behaved like machines( The Matrix ) and machines demonstrated human potential (I'm thinking ofThe Iron Giant , and his talent for sculpture.) They leapt, suddenly,from one plane of reality to another (the freeze frames on Tracy Flick'sdeformed, mid-motion face in Election , the sudden abstracted shots inThree Kings where a body ceased to be a person and became the pathwayfor a bullet and a haven for microbes and disease.) They explored the problemof two souls, same model body (the duplicate Buzz Lightyear's in Toy Story2 ) and one soul, too many bodies ( Being John Malkovich ). Theyexplored the problem of a soul attempting to will its wishes into being, evenwhen the body can't easily accommodate them ( Boys Don't Cry , TheSixth Sense .) Body and soul: This, it seems to me, is the problem thatinspired the best moments in the best films of 1999. This was fun. I'despecially like to thank you, David--the most generous and stimulating ofhosts.
