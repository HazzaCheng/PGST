Bernard Salick's entrepreneurial ideas may play inCalifornia, but they'll never make it in New York, says Warren Enker: "Not toomany people want ____________ at 4 a.m., so it's not that great agimmick."

Randy'sWrap-Up                        That several jokes aboutCalifornia cuisine mention cilantro is unexceptional (click ). That many jokesabout California's erotic life mention enemas is disconcerting. Are we 5 yearsold? Are we English? Are we meat and potatoes men who never get near freshfruits or vegetables? No, we're not. We're constantly frolicking about in allthat damn cilantro. We Californians apparently do little else. We eat eccentricmeals and enjoy sex and drugs with our film business colleagues, all of whomlook fabulous courtesy of the surgeon's art. And if technically cilantro isneither fruit nor vegetable, that's the least of my classification problems. Isa Gabor sister sex, food, lifestyle, or something more sinister? Is a liberalpresident the one who makes the biggest increase in defense spending in adecade, restricts habeas corpus, guts the protections of immigration law, andsends weapons to the Colombian army? Taxonomy is exhausting. I could use a cupof cilantro coffee.                           OntologicalAnswer                        Radiation.            With cancer likely to pass cardiovascular disease asthe nation's No. 1 one killer, many hospitals are vying for cancer patients,offering treatments still aloof from the financial restraints of managed care.Dr. Bernard Salick's chain of 24 for-profit cancer clinics has done well inCalifornia, making flexible schedules a part of its patient-friendly approach,but Dr. Warren Enker, associate director of New York's Beth Israel Hospital,remains skeptical.            (Editor's note: Noresponse exploited the suffering of anyone afflicted with a dreadful disease;all targeted profit-making medicine, California foolishness and, of course, thesurviving Gabor sisters, should there be any.)
