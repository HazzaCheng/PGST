                                 <i>Green Mile</i>age                        Hi Elvis,            Regarding your ideas about other avenues that The Green Mile couldhave explored: Yes, yours would be a better, braver, picture. The way popculture works, I think, is that the themes of small, cutting-edge pictures getwatered down over years into large, cutting-board pictures, and we can see thatprocess happening here. I have no doubt that the film's portrait of racerelations in Louisiana prisons in the 1930s is a fantasy (although no less afantasy than the sentimentalized view of the Eddie Murphy-Martin Lawrencefriendship in Ted Demme's Life ). Since all pictures are fantasies, somemore than most, I think it is useful to look at The Green Mile in termsof what its viewers will see. Many of them will see not clichs and stereotypesbut an enormously good black man whose fate they mourn. These viewers will beuninformed and unsophisticated in terms of the actual conditions in the Souththat your father described to you, but that is the nature of a society'smemory.            I had an interesting talk a few months ago with Peter Mayer, the formerchairman of Viking/Penguin, who has published just about everyone. I asked himfor the name of the best novelist on his list. Saul Bellow, he said. And thenhe mused that he wouldn't call Stephen King a great writer in the same sensebut would call him a great storyteller in the Dickens tradition (I am not usingquotation marks because I cannot claim to remember verbatim). King is scornedby those who do not read him, he said, but is underrated and sometimes verygood (he suggested I start with the short stories). In India recently, I wentto every bookstore I could find, and even in stores the size of a broom closetin back alleys (where the proprietors surely stocked no book they were notcertain they could sell), Stephen King was the second-most-stocked author. (Themost popular was Wodehouse!) These were book stalls catering to Indians. I sawfew tourists in Calcutta. Why do they read Stephen King in Calcutta? Becausethey want to.            No filmgoer attends a movie to "support" it. They choose a movie in the hopethat for a period of time they will be more entertained or interested orhappier than otherwise. Our job as critics is to encourage them to choose filmsthat we think will be less a waste of their time than those they might chooseon their own. This is a relative and inexact process, but worth doing. If we donot get up to our elbows in the real mix of real movies, real audiences, andreal motives for going to the movies, what function do we serve?            In insular, media-obsessed, buzz-driven markets like New York, I wonderwhether some critics, especially newcomers on the make, don't position theirreviews primarily to position themselves. The real reason Pauline Kael wasrevolutionary was that she wrote for actual moviegoers like herself, and evokedtheir needs and desires. No one who seriously believes Taste of Cherryor Ulysses' Gaze is a great movie believes that being able to enjoy amovie is necessary to make that movie great. Oh, the admirers of those moviesenjoy them, I suppose, but in a way so specialized and evolved that it hasnothing to do with moviegoing as it is generally understood.            Many of the films on our 10-best lists will play only in the larger cities.I get e-mail from moviegoers who complain that Being John Malkovich ,Boys Don't Cry , Princess Mononoke , and American Beautyhave not played in their towns. Topsy-Turvy certainly won't, andprobably not Magnolia . Subtitled films and documentaries may not play intheir states . Dan Talbott of New Yorker Films told me the averagesubtitled film makes 85 percent of its North American gross in ninetheaters .            Movies like The Green Mile are progressive compared with the moviesmost of America sees most weekends. The Green Mile is an important andworthy fact of popular culture--not sophisticated, not as hard-edged oraccurate or courageous as it could be, but more a part of the solution than apart of the problem. Here is an obviously unprovable guess: For 50 percent ofthe people who see it, it will be the best movie they see all year, even fromyour point of view.            Best,Roger
