                                 Iran: Ironic or Irenic?            The Washington Post and New York Timeslead with a call by the president of Iran for a "dialogue" between his countryand the U.S. USA Today leads with a report indicating that homelessnessand hunger are on the rise. The Los AngelesTimes goes with a reporton a rift developing among anti-tobacco forces based on whether or not it'sokay to grant any sort of legal immunity to tobacco companies in return forpublic health gains--just the sort of deal at the heart of the proposednational tobacco settlement before Congress.            The WP Iran lead reports that Iranian President Mohammed Khatemi madethe irenic remarks at a press conference, and described them as the mostconciliatory made by an Iranian leader toward the U.S. since the Islamicrevolution there in 1979. Khatemi said, "I declare my respects to the greatpeople of the United States." True, Khatemi also said that the U.S. mistakenlybelieves it is the sole world power, trying to "impose its will on the wholeworld at any cost," but the paper reports that a senior Clinton officialresponded by saying the administration is ready to sit down and talk to theIranian government if Khatemi's remarks are "authoritative." The NYT lead covers pretty much the same ground except that itmentions that Ali Khameni, not Khatemi, is Iran's supreme ruler. But even theTimes could have elaborated on this to help the reader try to decidewhat Khatemi's statements are worth. The WP piece doesn't even mentionKhameni (although another Post front pager, on Iran's loosening ofdomestic social restrictions, especially on women and intellectuals, does so inthe course of an informative paragraph on the Iranian power structure).            Neither the WP nor the NYT mentions as a possible Khatemimotivation the desire for eliminating obstacles to Caspian-Sea-based oil dealsinvolving U.S. petroleum companies, now hamstrung by anti-Iranian sanctions.( USAT and the LAT also have front-page coverage of Khatemi'sremarks.)            The USAT lead reports on a study just released by the U.S. Conferenceof Mayors, which found that the demand for emergency food and housing increasedin 1997 for the 13th straight year. Cited as factors are: increased substanceabuse and mental illness, the high cost of housing, low-paying jobs andreductions in federal welfare and food stamps. The WP carries this storyon page 17.            The Wall Street Journal runs a front-page feature reportingthat China's leaders are responding to the general Asiandownturn by putting off opening up their financial and currency markets andby overhauling the country's central bank. Plus, interest rates will probablybe cut by year's end.            Harvard government professor Michael Sandel puts some NYT op-ed spaceto good use today with some usefulhomely examples suggesting what's wrong with the emissions credit systemthe U.S. is advocating as a significant element in its greenhouse gas controlapproach. Turning pollution into a commodity to be bought and sold, he argues,removes the moral stigma that is properly associated with it. A fine meanssomething a fee does not. If, Sandel wonders, a busy contractor used thehandicapped parking near his work site and willingly paid the fine as a simplecost of business, isn't he still doing something wrong ?            The WP reports that according to Justice Department statistics,the 74 executions carried out thus far this year in theUnited States represent the highest number in any one year since capitalpunishment was reinstated in 1976 and the most in four decades. Texas has hadthe most dead men walking, Virginia placing a distance second. All the executedwere men convicted of murder: 44 whites, 24 blacks, and two "other." Theprisoners executed in 1996 had been on death row an average of 10 years andfive months. Polling indicates, says the Post , that the percentage ofthose favoring the death penalty has nearly doubled in the past thirty years.(This piece is by George Lardner Jr., whose daughter was murdered a few yearsago.)                           Say it ain't so. The NYT runs this headline: "FraternityMembers Among Heaviest College Drinkers, Study Shows."
