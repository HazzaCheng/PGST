                                 Off the Marx                        Dear Jim,            Daniel Bell spends such an extended amount of time writing about Marx, thatit's hard to discuss this book without making reference to Marxism. Perhaps insome trendy way--much as Nike revived Che Guevara with a swoosh instead of astar on his beret--Marx will be back in vogue sometime in the '00s. Hip-hopinformation workers will discourse on Karl during MTV's Road Rules .We'll have a Marxist analysis of banner-ad "click throughs," and tomes on thefive-year plan for the collectivization of Windows 2001.            I find it difficult to discuss Marx today, because it's so hard to makesense of him in the context of our time. Let's take a look at some of the moresuper-capitalist structures: the use of stock options to "incentivize" workers.As workers, like, err, Microsoft employees for instance, get vested withoptions (convertible to stock), or get to buy stock at a discounted rate(typically 15 percent of that day's market price), it's hard to say where the"capitalist class" ends and the "proletariat" begins. The tension between thehaves and the have-nots is supposed to destabilize the system, leading to--inMarx's view--a revolution of the proletariat. Bell examines this question, butphrases it in terms of "envy," writing, "Democracy is by nature contentiousbecause men constantly covet what other men have ... the result is often--inNietzsche's term--ressentiment or envy, anger, and hatred towards thoseat the top." What then to make of Newsweek's recent cover story, with atag line (paraphrasing) "Everyone is getting rich, except for me!" accompanyinga Roy Lichtenstein-esque caricature of a 1950s businessman with furrowedbrow?            The cover--a reference to the omnipresent Internet/Nasdaq slow-mo capitalistmoney shot that's lasted four years--doesn't hint at any sort of destabilizingclass conflict, but rather phrases it in terms of envy alone. There's alwayssomeone else with a better package. By turning the stock market into America'snational lottery, everyone gets a chance to become a successful capitalist. Ourgonzo day traders, high on Starbucks double lattes and monitor afterburn, aretoday's working class. With 90 percent of them estimated to lose money,extending their margin calls on their Visa bills, they're modern-daysharecroppers of a sort, indebted to the dot-com company store known as anonline brokerage. In this kind of environment, Bell's analysis seems off in thewrong side of the woods. As you point out Jim, Bell is really a reformedold-school lefty. As far as I can tell, the main element of his vision that'scome to pass is his rather abstract statement that "Now reality is primarilythe social world."            He also wrote, "The post-industrial society is essentially a game betweenpersons." (There's a Ted Kaczynski quality to his writing--earnest,structurally obsessive and plodding.)            I take this to mean that our media-matrix--TV, radio, Net, andmagazines--have come to form our reality. And this media world, obsessed withcelebrity, famous "persons," and the game between them, does form the sharedexperience as a society. This aspect of Bell's thinking isn't developed much inhis book. Another aspect of our future that he mentions, but fails to reallyinvestigate, is his criticism of "groups" ("blacks," hippies, women, etc.) andhis sense that a cultural fissure is appearing between young and old. Where hesees these elements as destabilizing and misguided, we've come to understandthem as modern-day tribalism--what marketers like to call "affinity groups."But from Bell's perspective, affirmative action, demands for quotas, andautomatic inclusion of minority groups in democratic decisions through mandatesare his red flags. He imagines a future where the call of every minority forinclusion, by quota, destroys the meritocratic principle of his favoredscientist-citizenry. The problem with revisiting this book is that so many ofBell's bugaboos from 1973 don't exist anymore. Twelve years of Reagan-Bush pluseight of Clinton took care of that, along with the longest peacetime economicexpansion in American history.            So Jim, what's the takeaway from Bell that you're left with? Any gems inthis coal mine?
