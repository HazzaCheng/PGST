                                 More Swiss Cheesiness?            A new game of chicken with Saddam over arms inspections leads at USA Today andthe Washington Post . At the New York Timesand the Los Angeles Times , it's signs that Indonesia is ready toshoulder real economic reforms.            Yesterday, Iraq halted the work of yet another U.N. weapons inspection team.USAT and the WP both report that the official reasons are thatthe team has too many Americans and that the team leader, former Marine ScottRitter, is a spy. USAT reports that on a 1995 Iraq visit, Ritter, aseasoned inspector, discovered smuggled-in missile guidance equipment. ThePost adds the detail that Iraq's latest tantrum followed a day ofaggressive surprise inspections conducted by Ritter's team. The U.S. reactionis to re-emphasize that Saddam must comply and that all diplomatic and militaryoptions are on the table.            Both the NYT and LAT emphasize that Indonesian presidentSuharto has received more international attention, in the form of visits fromU.S. and IMF delegations and calls from numerous foreign leaders, than he hasin years, and that he seems to be responding with a real austerity pledge,including the postponement of several major government investments in thedubious projects of family members. The NYT reports on another publicbuck-up: a group of Indonesian tycoons joined the nation's finance minister fora televised purchase of the local currency.            Although prior press reports have wondered if the 76-year-old Suharto'sfailing health would impair his ability to lead his country out of the currentcrisis, neither of today's Times stories emphasize this.            According to the LAT front, a study coming out today from the SimonWiesenthal Center will charge that thousands of Jewish refugees were confined by the Swiss duringWorld War II in special camps, sometimes behind barbed wire and at gunpoint.Often, says the paper, the Jews were forced to work for little or no pay, andeven forced to pay special taxes to defray the expenses of theirconfinement.            The Wall Street Journal quotes fresh government researchindicating that total U.S. health care expenditures rose but aninflation-adjusted 1.9% in 1996, the slowest growth rate in nearly forty years.The study cites the 90's explosive growth of managed care as a major factor.But, the Journal points out, with spending in the public health caresector (primarily Medicare and Medicaid) coming under firmer budgetary control,the growth of private medical costs may be poised to rise above 5% per year forthe first time since the early 90s.            The NYT front reports a major policy reversal on the part of the nation's leading AIDSservice agency. After years of actively opposing the reporting by New York'sdoctors of HIV-positive people to state health departments, the Gay Men'sHealth Crisis has just endorsed the practice. (But prefers tracking via a codesystem to one using actual names.)            Despite all the budget euphoria swirling about, business writer Allan Sloanuses his WP column to point out a familiar but forgottenfact: There is no surplus if you eschew "fedmath" and instead calculate assetsand liabilities the way a business does, i.e., not letting the government'spension system, Social Security, be used to draw down the deficit. Figured thisway, states Sloan, the 1997 budget deficit was $103.9 billion.            The NYT front reports on an unpredicted consequence of the Asianeconomic crisis: the Asian arms race is cooling off because most of the region'snations are suddenly unable to go through with planned weapons purchases. Justlast week, Indonesia announced that it would put off buying $1 billion inRussian weapons, and Thailand and South Korea are delaying aircraft purchases.Malaysia is unusual in that it is canceling outright a helicopter and jet deal,but most of the other deals will probably only be delayed. Here's an idea: whynot require these countries to swear off such weapons deals as a condition ofreceiving any IMF or U.S. bailout money?            The WP reports that following a year of sensitive negotiations, theGerman government has finally agreed to spend $110 million to compensate 18,000Jewish victims of the Nazis who are living in Eastern Europe and the formerSoviet Union. While information is comparatively fresh and large numbers of thesurvivors are still around, why not institute similar reparations to be paid byRussia to victims of the Gulag? Again, why not make such payments a conditionof U.S. and international aid packages?
