                                 Jung for the First Time            The Washington Post , New York Times ,and LosAngeles Times lead with the victory of long-time dissident Kim Dae Jungin the South Korean presidential election. USA Todayleads with President Clinton's official announcement of the long-rumoreddecision to keep U.S. troops in Bosnia indefinitely.            The WP calls the Korean vote the most remarkable in the country'shistory, pointing out that upon his inauguration, Kim, 73, will take over agovernment that kidnapped and jailed him and repeatedly tried to kill him, onceby planning to toss him off a ship at sea. The LAT observes that in Korea, Kim has often been compared toAndrei Sakharov, Lech Walesa, and Nelson Mandela. The Post notes thatthe victory celebrations were particularly joyous in the city of Kwangju, wherein 1980, the government suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations, killinghundreds, and blamed the episode on Kim, who was sentenced to death (he waseventually given a medical release to the U.S.). And now, points out theNYT , Kim will have the power to pardon the imprisoned Koreanex-president convicted of ordering that massacre.            The NYT stresses more than the other dailies that a big factorin the election outcome was an electorate enraged by the country's financialcrisis and furious at economic mismanagement by the ruling party. TheTimes adds to the picture of Kim as the ultimate outcast by relatinghow, as recently as the mid-80s, the U.S. Embassy viewed him as too radical toinvite to the annual 4th of July party.            The papers all note that upon his victory, Kim pledged to implement theIMF-crafted economic bailout that was already agreed to by the currentgovernment.            The Clinton Bosnia announcement is also front-page news at the NYT ,the WP , and the LAT . The coverage emphasizes President Clinton'sfrank admission that he was wrong to have set a definite timetable for gettingtroops out. Clinton stated that the military mission had enforced a fragilepeace but that it was still fragile and so, in the administration's exitthinking, deadlines are out and "benchmarks" gauging Bosnia's progress are in.The NYT notes that Clinton's off-the-cuff examples ofbenchmarks did not include the return of refugees or the arrest of thoseindicted as war criminals.            The LAT front reports that in 1995, a Clinton national securitystaffer named Sheila Heslin asked the CIA to provide intelligenceon several U.S. citizens despite a presidential order banning the agency fromdoing so. The paper bases its story on CIA documents.            The Wall Street Journal 's lead feature focuses on a group ofsingle mothers in a Maryland housing project who have been thrust by welfarereform into the workplace for the very first time. The piece shows how the women have become rather harsh intheir attitudes towards welfare mothers. "It makes me mad," says one, "Takingmoney out of my check and giving it to those ho's." The story also shows thateven a steady job doesn't automatically translate into financial security: Onewoman in the story has only been able to save $100 after six months ofemployment, but she did spring for some Donna Karan, a four-foot TV/VCR tower,wall-to-wall carpet, and a stocked fish tank.            According to USAT 's "Snapshot," 13.7 percent of all Americans ended1996 with a total household income below the federal poverty level of $16,036for a family of four.            In a rarity for a front-section story, not to mention for the front page,The NYT comes right out and says that Barbara Chase-Riboud, the womanwho accused "Steven Spielberg's studio," Dreamworks, (hey, what do Katzenbergand Geffen have to do to get their names in the paper?) of stealing from herwork in making the movie "Amistad," is herself a plagiarist. The Times says that a novel shewrote in 1986 contains entire passages from a scholarly book that preceded itby 50 years.            Remember "Lucille," B.B. King's guitar? Well, guess who has it now?According to the NYT , the Pope. King handed it over during a papalaudience.                           No Freeh pizza. The WSJ reports that the most common fake namegiven to pizza deliverers in Washington, D.C. is...Janet Reno.
