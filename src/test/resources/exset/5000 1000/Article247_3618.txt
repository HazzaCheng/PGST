                                 Barron's on AOL: All Talk, No News                        America Online's stock price dropped more than six points yesterday. Initself, this is of course hardly stop-the-presses news. In fact, given thevolatility of Internet stocks, it's more like the proverbial dog-bites-manstory. But the drop in AOL's price was noteworthy because it seems to have beenprovoked almost entirely by a negative item on the company that appeared inBarron's over the weekend.            The item was the centerpiece of the weekly column by Alan Abelson, asbearish a commentator on Wall Street as exists today and a man who bears aspecial enmity toward Internet stocks, all of which--as far as I can tell--hethinks are grossly overvalued. In essence, Abelson gave a short-seller with asignificant short position in AOL--meaning that he's betting that the company'sstock price will drop--the opportunity to blast the company and explain whyAOL's future is so bleak.            Now, there's nothing wrong with quoting short-sellers on companies, evenwhen they stand to make a great deal of money if their comments knock thosecompanies' stock prices down. Short sellers are often founts of usefulinformation, and a certain kind of institutionalized skepticism seems to makethem adept at sniffing out fraud and deception, particularly in corporateaccounting. Certainly the financial press is full of more than enough fundmanagers touting the stocks they love for there to be plenty of room forshort-sellers attacking the stocks they hate.            What was striking about the attack on AOL, though, was just how obvious anddevoid of new information it was. We were informed that AOL's subscriber growthwas slowing, that the company was facing increased competition and that theadvent of free Internet services, especially abroad, would hurt it. We werealso told that AOL was already suffering, and would suffer more in the future,from price cuts on the part of its American competitors, and that soon thecompany would have to rescind the price hike it was able to push through lastyear.            The last point is, of course, pure speculation, and it rests on twofundamental misconceptions. The first is the idea that AOL is just like anyother Internet service provider. It's not, because even though it'sconsiderably more integrated with the Internet than ever before, itsproprietary services--including above all its chat rooms--continue to attractand keep consumers. There's no evidence that AOL users are price-sensitive. Thesecond misconception is the idea that Net users are willing to abandon theire-mail addresses to save a few bucks. This is just wrong. E-mail is the killerapp of the Internet, and it is a true source of customer stickiness. It may beeasier to change your e-mail address than your street address, but for a lot ofus, we'd probably have to tell more people about the former than thelatter.            In any case, whether Abelson was right or wrong is not really as interestingas the fact that despite the familiarity of his critique, it was able to drivedown AOL's stock price by almost 7 percent in a single day. No AOL investor whoread that piece could have come away from it thinking, "Damn. I was just wrongabout the business. I need to sell." In other words, there was no newinformation in the story that needed to be incorporated into the stockprice.            Except, of course, that the existence of the story itself was informationabout AOL. It's not that what was in Abelson's column drove the stock down. Thefact of Abelson's column hurt AOL, because investors assumed that the fact ofAbelson's column would hurt AOL.            The real question is whether, in incorporating the reality of Abelson'scolumn so quickly, the stock market was efficient or inefficient.Unfortunately, this is almost a metaphysical question. An efficient market isone that assimilates everything meaningful that can be known about a companyinto that company's stock price. In the long run, Abelson's critique of AOL ismeaning less . But in the financial-news-saturated and twitchy market welive in, in the short run a piece blasting a stock is almost sure to move thatstock, which would seem to make it meaningful. And so the snake ends up eatingits own tail.                           Illustration on Slate's Table of Contents by Mark AlanStamaty.
