Randy'sWrap-Up                        The worst part about the sea, as Ramanathan and theScripps Institution of Oceanography must both lament when it comes time fortheir annual talent show, is that nothing amusing ever takes place beneath it.Which you certainly couldn't say about Errol Flynn. Which is why Nol Cowardset so few of his plays underwater. James Bond, on the other hand, is alwayspoking about in some villain's undersea lair, and his attempts at repartee arejust parody bait. When the diving suits go on, the witty banter stops.Something to do with all those air hoses, like trying to be witty at thedentist. It is impossible to name a single amusing movie that takes placebeneath the waves. Just look at dolphins, the very model of marinesophistication, a creature whose intelligence we're always called upon toadmire like some horrible precocious child. They're frequently found at SeaWorld, performing in shows whose dialogue will not be quoted later at dinner.In some countries, they'd be the dinner. The dolphin, not the precocious child.Although it's a thought.            There are, of course,many elegant and flirtatious scenes set on yachts. Clearly, wit operates beston the surface.                           Vast PollutedAnswer                        Ramanathan announced the discovery of a vast haze,3.8 million square miles, about the size of the United States, hanging over theIndian Ocean. "It appeared as if the whole Indian subcontinent was surroundedby a mountain of pollution," he said.            The problem with this haze, blown over the water bywinter winds from the Himalayas, is that it blocks out sunlight, lowering thetemperature.            The prevailing windsreverse in late spring, blowing the haze north over the land, where itsparticles combine with monsoon rains and fall to the earth, dissipating thecloud. But that's bad too, because the haze-sodden precipitation is just thesort of acid rain that plays havoc with both terrestrial and marine life.
