Lindsay's legacyNonprofits honor the retired attorney and volunteer for hisdedication to social justice.By Mary Carr MayleSAFE Shelter executive director Gail Reese-Wheeler vividlyrecalls her first encounter with Jim Lindsay's indomitablespirit.It was nine years ago and Reese-Wheeler was barely into hersecond week with the shelter when Lindsay, a SAFE Shelter boardmember, invited her to lunch to talk about "some ideas he had forthe shelter.""Jim had so much vision and enthusiasm," Reese-Wheeler says. "Bythe end of that one-hour lunch, he had listed off at least 20projects - not the least of which was a new shelter -- and wassitting there waiting for me to respond."He scared me to death, until I began to realize that JimLindsay was the kind of man who would roll up his shirtsleeves andwork right beside you."On Thursday, Lindsay got his first look at one of his mostfervent hopes come true -- a new home for SAFE Shelter. As his son,Ken, wheels him up the concrete ramp and through the doors,Lindsey's grin says it all."I'm amazed. I had hoped this would happen, but I never dreamedit would be so soon or so grand," he says with difficulty, pickinghis words carefully.Lindsay, who has suffered several strokes and moved with hiswife, Shirley, to an assisted-care community in Jacksonville, Fla.was back in town for "Jim Lindsay Day," which included a tour ofthe shelter and a reception attended by many of the people whoselives he touched as a volunteer with Savannah nonprofits.Lou Barnes first met Lindsay when he served on the board ofParent and Child Development Services, where she was the humanresources manager. Later, they both served on the SAFE Shelterboard."I wouldn't have missed this day for anything," Barnes says."Jim is such a giving person, so committed to helping those lessfortunate. I've seen very few men as dedicated to communityvolunteerism as Jim. Yes, he was retired and had the time, but hecould have just as easily spent that time on the golf course. Jimis one who has always given as generously of his time as he did hismoney."A retired corporate lawyer, Lindsay entered Oberlin College at14, then went on to law school at the University of Michigan.Daughter Pippi Ellison, who flew down from Boston for thecelebration, says her father's passion for social justice "hasalways been there.""From very early on, I learned that there were people incircumstances very different from ours and that ignoring thosepeople was not an option," Ellison says. "My father was alwaysworking for fair- and low-income housing.When the family lived in New York, Ellison says, her father gotthe whole family involved in the New York City Mission Society,passing on the exclusive summer camps to send his children to thesociety's camp for inner-city kids."I was a camper and my older sister and brother were counselors.It was education through immersion," says Ellison, who works as aclinical psychologist near Boston.Meeting Jim Lindsay was an education of a different sort forBill Broker of Georgia Legal Services."This was back when we were on the second floor of the UrbanHealth Center on York Street and I had been managing attorney foronly a year or two," Broker recalls. "In strolls Jim Lindsay,saying he's a retired lawyer now living in Savannah and he wasinterested in doing free legal work for poor people."He really shook up my whole mindset," Broker says. "I was sofocused on bringing in new young lawyers right out of schoolbecause that was what we could afford. It never occurred to me thatthere might be older, experienced attorneys out there willing tohelp."It was Lindsay, Broker says, who first broached the idea ofhaving a senior volunteer attorney program, which is flourishingtoday.Lindsay helped out at Georgia Legal Services by working onbenefits cases, such as Social Security and Medicaid claims. He andBroker later began the Mediation Center in Savannah, with bothserving on the nonprofit's first board.But, perhaps Lindsay's biggest contribution to Georgia LegalServices was the inspiration he provided its young lawyers."Jim sat in on our weekly meetings, listening to people talkabout their cases," Broker says. "He had such a depth ofunderstanding, a maturity of judgment and an uncanny ability tohone in on the real issues."Just to hear him say, 'I believe in what you're doing,' raisedour game and made us want to work harder."I think that's the kind of effect Jim Lindsay has on everyonehe touches."
