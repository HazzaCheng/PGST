                                 Sub-atomic Mass Hysteria            The Supreme Court's refusal to fast-track the legal battle between PresidentClinton and Kenneth Starr leads all the papers. The life sentence without thepossibility of parole handed to Oklahoma bombing figure Terry Nichols drawsfront-page coverage at the New York Times ,Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes , but USA Today puts it on page 3. Nichols was expected to be putaway for keeps unless he spoke to the court in a particularly informative orremorseful way, but he made no statement. The WP and NYT sayNichols, called an "enemy of the Constitution" by the judge, displayed noemotion. But the LAT says that upon entering the courtroom, he broke intotears. As in previous key Oklahoma bombing proceedings, no statements rivaledin power those of survivors and victims' relatives. The NYT reports that one woman who saw many dead babiesat the bombing site testified that whenever "I see these mothers with emptyarms, I wonder, was that your baby I kissed on his way to heaven?"            The Court's decision to return the Lewinsky case issues of attorney-clientand protective privilege back to the regular appeals court process is generallytaken as a rebuff for Starr's contention that these matters pose aconstitutional crisis of the first magnitude. There is more divergence aboutwhat this does to the course of the case. The LAT says that this mightkeep Starr from questioning White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey and Secret Serviceofficers until "well into next year." But USAT says that the SupremeCourt might well end up hearing the case "by month's end."            The LAT "Column One" fascinates today with a story ofbreakthrough genetic research being done in Iceland. It seems that Icelandprovides the best database in the world for trying to isolate genes responsiblefor such scourges as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, adult-onset diabetes andstroke. That's because Iceland has an incredibly homogenous population, further"culled" by a plague and a natural disaster, and keeps excellent medicalrecords (including a tissue sample from every autopsy conducted in the countrysince the 1930s). This research environment has, reports the LAT , lureda geneticist away from the Harvard Medical School and enabled him to getmillions in underwriting from drug giant Hoffman-La Roche. The project is setto sell public stock shares within a year and if the science pays off, couldend up worth billions. Some critics are calling this exploitative "bio-piracy,"but, the paper reports, any effective treatments it creates will be dispensedto Icelanders for free.            The Wall Street Journal "Washington Wire" reports that in thewake of the Indian/Pakistan nukefest, a new buzzword is making the Pentagonrounds: "rogue democracies." And in a WP op-ed, Stephen S. Rosenfeld makes an importantpoint about this new leg of the arms race. Previously, it had generally beenheld that non-proliferation could be secured via providing for the securityneeds of the nuclear have-nots, but, says Rosenfeld, India and Pakistan didn'treally build their bombs to address security concerns. (When was the last timebefore all this that Kashmir made the front page?) No, he writes, they wentovertly nuclear to achieve status . And when poor self-esteem is the rootproblem, conventional medicine doesn't work. It takes large doses of"diplomatic therapy," which will, Rosenfeld writes, "take years."            The NYT , LAT , and WP fronts herald the discovery thatthe sub-atomic particle called a neutrino, which is chargeless and was formerlythought massless too, in fact has mass. The papers assure us this isearth-shaking. "The Universe May Never Be the Same" is slugged overNYT Universe reporter Malcolm Browne's dispatch. The Times saysthe discovery was announced by 120 physicists at a "neutrino conference."Hoo-boy, bet the bartenders and hookers go on vacation during that one.
