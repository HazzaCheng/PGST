                                 Peace Annan?            The ongoing U.S. assessment of the U.N.-brokered Iraq deal leads at USAT andthe WP. The national edition of the NYT goes with a Senate vote that keepsalive a campaign fund-raising reform bill (the metro edition of theTimes goes with a state court decision that gives New York City theright to kick topless joints and sex shops out of Times Square). The LAT leadis El Nino rainstorms that have killed six in California, while the paper'soff-lead is the news that Kenneth Starr will prosecute White House officials ifhe believes they have spread false information about his staff. The stance,says the paper, amounts to an escalation of the confrontation with the Clintonadministration to "frenetic proportions."                           USAT reports that the U.N. Security Council delayed voting on theIraq agreement after pressing Secretary-General Kofi Annan on several points.The big unresolved issues, says the paper: the role of the diplomats who wouldnow accompany weapons inspectors on their rounds, the inspectors' chain ofcommand now, and whether or not the agreement's nod to respecting Iraqisovereignty could interfere with inspections. The WP says the U.S. fearsthe new inspection organization will be more susceptible than its predecessorto outside political pressures. In response, says the Post , Annantelephoned President Clinton yesterday, reassuring him that inspections willremain controlled by technical experts.            The WP also reports that the U.S. wants the U.N. resolution toautomatically declare Iraq in breach of the agreement if it resumes itsobstructive ways. The WP runs the text of the deal signed by Annan andHussein, and the language is surprisingly clear. "Today's Papers" has hadapartment leases that were harder to follow--and longer.            The NYT front runs a nice piece of access journalism detailing howPresident Clinton, and his top national security aides, especially MadeleineAlbright, contributed to the ultimate details of the Annan/Hussein deal. At onepoint, apparently, Al Gore suggested that the administration considerdesignating Saddam a war criminal. According to the paper, Washington was farmore actively involved in planning Annan's approach than has been previouslyacknowledged.            But the biggest NYT story is that President Clinton has decided tohave his closest aides cite executive privilege to keep from testifying to theStarr grand jury about internal White House discussions on the Monica L.matter. The notion could be put to a test before a federal judge as early asthis week.            The WSJ reports that the Justice Department has decided to fight Starr'sefforts to obtain testimony from presidential bodyguards. The decision wasforged, says the Journal , after the Secret Service director, in arguingthat efficient protection requires agent proximity and hence agentconfidentiality, made a presentation at the DOJ that included a slow-motionvideotape of a Secret Service agent taking a bullet intended for Ronald Reaganin 1981.            Some editorial writers weigh in today on the escalating battle betweenClinton and Starr. The WP lead editorial says Starr "absurdly"subpoenaed White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, and assesses the White Housestrategy of "looking for dirt on prosecutors and trying to discreditstraightforward reporting of embarrassing facts" as "sleazy." The NYTlead editorial views Starr's move on Blumenthal as "bone stupid" tactically andan "attack on press freedom and the unrestricted flow of information."            The NYT reports that "robust investment returns coupled with strongdonations to higher education have created a financial boom for Americancolleges and universities, 25 of which now have endowments of $1 billion ormore." The piece goes on to quote various breathless university officials abouthow the money is rolling in, but nowhere is the question raised as to why iffinancial times are so good, tuition has risen at a ferocious rate, oftenoutpacing even health care costs.            The NYT front includes a Gina Kolata piece describing the rapidlyescalating cost of donor eggs for various infertility procedures. One NewJersey clinic has just doubled payments to donors, offering $5,000 for amonth's worth of eggs. The paper notes that sperm donors typically get lessthan $100, but also describes in some detail how much less fun egg donorshave.
