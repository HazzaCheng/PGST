AUtilitarian Burial                        In your"Egghead"column, it is stated that Jeremy Bentham's corpse was preserved according tohis wishes. Unfortunately, as so often happens, his last wishes were notfulfilled in accordance with his will. His wish was to have his clothedskeleton displayed, not a dressed, mummified corpse. I attach herewith the.            -- RobertBjorkland Toronto                           TrueGrits                        In his "Dialogue" on population, Ben Wattenberg refers to something slicingthrough something else "like a laser through grits."            Themetaphor is initially appealing, but on further examination it demandsclarification from Engineer Wattenberg. A laser strikes one as a particularlyinfelicitous tool for grits-slicing. Awkwardness aside (we're not talking laserpen-pointers here; do we take the laser to the breakfast table or the grits tothe laser?), at least two practical difficulties arise: As the slicing begins,some considerable quantity of steam should be produced, shielding the subjectgrits from our slicing instrument. Moreover, sliced grits show a disconcertingtendency toward self-healing. I'm reminded of thousands of Egyptian extrasfollowing Charlton Heston into the (temporarily) parted Red Sea. Will the gritsstay sliced? I think not.            -- JonathanLundell Half Moon Bay, Calif.                           WhyCouldn't He Be Kam Ho? Or Chin Fong?                        From "Today's Papers"on Jan. 23: "Amidst all this, Jack Lord and his hair died. The obits fail toclear up an abiding mystery: Why did Kam Fong play 'Chin Ho'? Why couldn't hejust be 'Kam Fong'?"            Sorry,but this is pretty offensive. Would Shuger ever have said: "Why did IrvingGoldberg play 'Sol Bernstein'? Why couldn't he just be 'Irving Goldberg'?" or"Why did Luigi Santini play 'Giuseppi Romano'? Why couldn't he just be 'LuigiSantini'?" That boy needs an editor. Can't you pay somebody else to stay up allnight to keep a lid on his, er, excesses?            -- Gary Krist                                       GreedGoeth Before a Fall                        Nancy Griffin writes in"Hollywood Strikes Back" that Michael Eisner extended an olivebranch to former friend Mike Ovitz, but Ovitz declined to accept it. She thennotes that Ovitz might be someone whose pride exceeds his greed.            This is anabsurd statement. Ovitz didn't engineer a $90-million severance package becausehe was proud of leaving Disney or his brainchild, Creative Artists Agency. Andnow that he has more money than God (or, at least, Oral Roberts), he doesn'tneed Eisner's friendship. He can open a studio on his own and thumb his nose ateveryone else.            -- Brian Hamburg WestHills, Calif.                           TheTroubles                        In "The Luck of the Irish,"James Surowiecki makes statements that are flat-out false, and omits manyissues that are at the real root of the problems.            The Irish Republican Armyalways notifies ahead of time when a bomb will be set off in a civilianarea. There is an established code just for that. He omitted this fact. WhenSurowiecki calls the Irish Catholics a minority he should point out that theymake up 45 percent of Northern Ireland. But only 5 percent of Irish Catholicshave been accepted into the police force.            Further, there was nomention of the release of Robert "Basher" Bates. Bates, who took part in dozensof murders of Catholics, has spent less time in prison than Joe Doherty, whowas convicted of one killing. (Bates' method was to beat the victims withhammers and then dismember them with butcher knives.)            Finally, the foundingfathers of the United States promised to help free Ireland. On Oct. 4, 1778,Ben Franklin assured the Irish, who made up half of Washington's army, that hewas "charged to assure you that means will be found by the Continental Congressto establish your freedom." On June 17, 1781, Franklin said of Ireland, "Now isthe time for France and the United States to help secure her independence."            HadAmerica kept its word, Surowiecki wouldn't have anything to lie about.            -- M.G.McCormick Glen Oaks, N.Y.                           Addressyour e-mail to the editors to letters@slate.com.
