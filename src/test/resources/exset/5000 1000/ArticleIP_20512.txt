                                 Good Nukes Make Good Neighbors            South Asian papers gaveextensive coverage to the goodwill journey of Indian Prime Minister A.B.Vajpayee, who crossed the Indo-Pakistani border on a bus this weekend to meetwith his counterpart Nawaz Sharif. According to Karachi's Dawn , Pakistan's foreignminister emphasized that nuclearization had given rise to new challenges andopportunities by bringing the two countries to "a defining moment."            The two day summitculminated in the Lahore Declaration, in which the parties resolved tointensify efforts to solve the Kashmir issue through ministerial talks andagreed to a series of "confidence-building measures." These measures includeproviding advance warning of ballistic missile tests and the continuation ofthe nations' respective unilateral moratoriums on nuclear testing. Thecountries plan to ease travel restrictions, and Sharif is expected to take atrip to New Delhi. The Times of India called the visit "a new chapter of amity inIndo-Pakistan relations," while the Independent pointed toward organized protests inLahore as evidence that the "commitment to neighborly amity is still less thantotal."            The papers highlighted the symbolism of the event. Vajpayeeis the first Indian prime minister to visit Pakistan in the last 10 years. Hisvisit marked the opening of the first regular bus route between the quarrellingnations since their foundation over 50 years ago. The Hindu of Madras quotesVajpayee's suggestion that "the running of the bus between the two countriessymbolizes the desire of the people to improve relations." The Guardian of London quotesPakistan's information minister's assertion that "in a situation where peopledon't even make gestures, this is a powerful sign." Nevertheless, the Indianpapers differed in their assessment of the summit's outcome. The Hinducommented that "this modest outcome was on expected lines and while it provideda framework for a new beginning, a lot would depend on the follow-up," whereasthe Times of India wrote that the "bold steps" in the memorandum ofunderstanding "set the tone for a shared vision of peace and stability."            The coverage in Pakistanipapers was tepid. The Lahore-based Nation reported that the visit took place "amidstfeeling of both apprehension and optimism." By contrast, the coverage ofthe visit to Pakistan of China's defense minister in Karachi's Dawn wasglowing.            Headlines throughout the world were also dominated by thestalled Kosovo peace talks. Nine hours after the NATO deadline for a deal onreturning autonomy to the Yugoslavian province had passed, the French foreignminister announced that the deadline had been extended by three days, thusforestalling the airstrikes that NATO had threatened. The Sunday papers placedthe blame for the deadlock on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic'sintransigent refusal to countenance a NATO-led force as peacekeepers, despitethe fact that Kosovo Albanians were holding out for a referendum onindependence once the three year interim period covered by the proposedsettlement expired. Britain's Daily Telegraph called Milosevic "Belgrade's master ofbrinksmanship." The Sunday Times of London commented that the stalemate evincedNATO's weak hand in forcing a settlement.            In a storytitled "US fails to win right to bomb Kosovo," Britain's Independent commentedMonday that the Kosovo Albanians' refusal to unilaterally sign on to thesettlement frustrated U.S. attempts to corner Milosevic with the choice ofaccepting the peace package or facing airstrikes. The paper remarked that theKosovo Albanians' refusal to assent makes it more likely that the talks willend in "a fudged compromise."            The Sunday Times reported that Britishpolice have had some success in sartorial sleuthing. A computerized database offootprints found at crime scenes reveals that Reebok Classics recentlydisplaced Nike Air Max as the favorite footwear of British criminals. In onecase, police used a shoe print to link an unlucky Nike loyalist to 36 othercrimes. The paper said that although the police cannot use sneaker stereotypingto arrest people, officers are told to watch out for suspicious shoes.
