                                 University Admitting Mistakes?            The LosAngeles Times and New York Timeslead with the University of California's disclosure that as a result ofProposition 209's mandate to abandon affirmative action in admissions, the newfreshman classes at its two most selective schools, Berkeley and UCLA, willhave far fewer minority students than in the recent past. The Washington Post goes with the Supreme Court's decisionallowing states to ban the courtroom use of polygraph results. USA Todayleads with news that might be heartening for many users of the now withdrawndiet concoction Redux: a new study suggests that short-term use of the drug isnot associated with an increase in heart valve problems. But the paper goes onto note that the study was sponsored by Redux's manufacturer and does not inany case address the consequences of long-term use.            The University of California admissions situation is relayed mostfrantically at the LAT , which states that "the number of African Americansaccepted by UC Berkeley has plunged 66% and the number admitted to UCLA dropped43%," without stating most of the raw numbers behind the percentages. (A commonjournalistic mistake/trick.) The WP does use the raw numbers whenreporting on Berkeley, but unaccountably goes back to emphasizing percentageswhen discussing UCLA. The NYT also shies away from the actual numbers ofstudents involved, but at least emphasizes the before-and-after-209 minoritypercentages of the total admitted pool, an illuminating datum. Both theLAT and NYT report that the minority drop occurred despite theuniversity's decision to give extra consideration to poor applicants, thusproving that in California at least, class isn't race.            One university official is quoted by the LAT as seeing in the shiftthe message that California's secondary schools must improve, while the paperhas Prop. 209 architect Ward Connerly saying it means some of the burden foradmissions must be put back on black and Latino families and the studentsthemselves. A more striking Connerly quote somehow doesn't make the cut ateither Times , but is in the WP and USAT : "These numberswill finally and conclusively put to rest the lie that we've heard for so longfrom these campuses that race is only one factor in how they choosestudents..It's the decisive factor." (The WP should have, by the way,changed the present tense in that last sentence to the past, which was clearlyConnerly's meaning. USAT gets this right.)            Some questions: Why does the NYT headline only mention the drop inblack admissions and relegate the drop for Hispanics to the subhead? Why don'tany of the stories mention the graduation rates for blacks and Hispanicsat the two schools under the old regime?            The Wall Street Journal spills a lot of ink on tobacco, withpieces about trial lawyers' pursuit of anti-tobacco cases, the attempt by theanti-asbestos lobby to tap into any settlement deal, and the political spin onthe pending Senate bill. The "Capitol Journal" column paints a picture of abill in "deep peril," and of a sharply divided Senate besieged by an "enraged"tobacco industry. In the end, says the paper, it may fall to one man to bringorder out of this chaos--Bill Clinton.            Both the LAT and NYT go front-page with the news that aneleven-year-old girl, Emily Rosa, did research for a science fair two years ago as afourth-grader that is being published today in the prestigious Journal of theAmerican Medical Association. Her project was a refreshingly simple experimentthat showed "therapeutic touch" practitioners don't have a special ability todetect an energy field around human bodies. One question: why does the NYT say she showed that the healers detected a humanhand they couldn't see at a rate "no better than chance" would have predicted,when her results show they scored only 44 percent, which is 6 percentworse?
