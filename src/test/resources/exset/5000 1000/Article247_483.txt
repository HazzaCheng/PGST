                                 Dollar Bill's Diary            The coming Washington tax reform debate leads at USA Today . Atthe New York Times ,it's the decision of major HMOs to trim benefits for Medicare members. TheLosAngeles Times leads with the news that senior Clinton administrationtypes are turning up the pressure on Saddam Hussein and reluctant Europeanallies for inspection access to about 80 Iraqi presidential "palace" sites. Andthe Washington Post goes with a look at the alarmingnumber of unexplained deaths of young people in the District of Columbia. Itseems that in recent years, on average, three people a month between the agesof 15 and 44 have died there under circumstances that have never been clearedup, a rate that appears, the Post says, to be the highest in thecountry. The paper lays much of the blame for this on the inadequacies of theD.C. medical examiner's office.            The USAT lead states that President Clinton, eager to counterRepublican proposals for the flat tax or a national sales tax, is consideringvarious other simplification proposals, including one that would exempt as manyas 19 million taxpayers from having to file at all, by letting the IRScalculate their taxes for them, which would then be withheld by employers.            The companion USAT news section cover storyreports that 95 percent of respondents to the paper's poll on the topic saythey want a change in the system, and yet a majority of them do not supporteither the flat tax or the national sales tax--and want to retain deductionsfor home mortgage interest and charitable contributions.            The NYT notes that for cost containment reasons, managed care companies nationwide are starting to cut some of thegenerous benefits--such as low- or no-cost prescriptions and eyeglasses and nomembership fees--that attracted elderly Americans on Medicare to their plans inthe first place. The changes are due, says the paper, to rising drug costs anda cap set by Congress on payments to HMOs.            These increases are significant because, observes the Times , Congressand the Clinton administration had been counting on managed care to helpcontain Medicare costs. A similar point is made in the Wall Street Journal 's front-page piece about the spiralingmanagement problems at the leading HMOs: namely that HMOs are not proving to bea brake on the system's problems, but rather arenas that readily reproducethem. What we're learning it seems, is that regardless of the setting, themarket will tend to punish coverage of those, like the elderly, with the mosthealth needs. And so the question that the Clinton health care reforms at leastraised--What to add to the marketplace to ensure availability?--remains in needof an answer.            On its front, the LAT continues the comprehensive look it beganSunday into Bill Clinton's involvement during the 1996 presidential campaignwith 237 fund-raising events that brought in $119.2 million. Thestory is illustrated by a shot of the presidential daybook for the week ofJune 17, 1996, during which Clinton raised $5,562,000. Clinton, the piecestates, spent far more time raising money for his re-election than any otherincumbent president in modern history.            The WP runs an AP story inside that brings home the high cost of poorpersonnel policies insides agencies like the DEA. According to authorities, tendays ago a veteran DEA agent fatally shot a colleague. But, says thestory, this was hardly the first sign of trouble. Prior to that, the man hadbeen in and out of counseling--once because he held a gun to his wife'shead--and had undergone alcohol abuse treatment three times. And oh yeah, therewas the time he shot and killed a man during an argument. The shooting wasruled justifiable, but it was also determined that the agent had 11 beers inhim at the time. So what was his posting at the time of this last shooting? TheMiami High Intensity Drug Trafficking Office.            How about this for a good idea? According to another AP story in thePost , South Dakota governor William Janklow started a program that putsprisoners to work building homes for the elderly and disabled in the state'ssmall towns. So far, 161 South Dakotans have bought houses built by theconvicts.            And the 1997 "No-Duh!" Award goes to...the IMF. Today's WP headlinesays it all: "IMF Cuts Asian Growth Forecasts."
