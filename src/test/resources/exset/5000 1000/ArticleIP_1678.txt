                                 Lady or a Tramp?                         The commentariat cleaves theClinton Scandals into three issues this week: 1) the mud-storm surroundingKathleen Willey; 2) Congress' readiness to receive Kenneth Starr's report; and3) Robert Bennett's about-face on publicizing Paula Jones' amorous life.            There arealmost as many opinions on Issue 1 as there are pundits. Jack Germond( Inside Washington ) defines the pro-Willey end of the spectrum. NotingWilley's initial reluctance to testify, Germond dismisses talk of impuremotives as the White House "trying to throw sand in our eyes."Middle-of-the-roaders Evan Thomas ( Inside Washington ) and Al Hunt (CNN'sCapital Gang ) agree that Willey's story remains convincing but see sometruth in anti-Willeyism: There "are no clean test-tubes" in this scandal, saysThomas. At the other extreme, The McLaughlin Group 's two libs (MortonKondracke and Eleanor Clift) make quite a show of pitching tent in theanti-Willey camp. Willey's credibility has been destroyed; the questions abouther motives have been devastating, they maintain.            Most pundits follow Ellen Goodman (CNN's LateEdition ) in excusing the White House's anti-Willey smear campaign as"inevitable" while characterizing it as far from "appealing." George Will(ABC's This Week ) and Charles Krauthammer ( Inside Washington )share outrage over the White House's eagerness to release Willey-relatedcorrespondence while failing to answer scores of Lewinsky-related queries(remember her?). Clift contends that there has been no character assassinationby the White House, only the release of facts. Krauthammer detects class biasin the sympathy for Willey evinced by the same feminists who refused to rallyaround Jones.            Issue 2--the Hill's hungerfor the Starr report--finds all agreeing that the Republicans must avoidlooking cheap or nasty. Henry Hyde, the widely respected head of the JudiciaryCommittee, is the Republicans' "ace in the hole," says Mark Shields (PBS'sNewsHour With Jim Lehrer ). But the committee is filled with GOP "fullmooners," he adds, who will make the Republicans look clownish. Fred Barnes andSusan Page ( Late Edition ) declare that impeachment proceedings occurringafter the November elections are less likely to unseat Clinton, while GeorgeStephanopoulos ( This Week ) insists that a late start will permit theRepublicans to "go full bore" without fear of offending short-memoried voterswith their partisanship. The Clinton camp's threat to invoke executiveprivilege is widely dismissed as a foolish delaying tactic.            Issue 3,Bob Bennett's decision not to detail Paula Jones' love life for the court, isportrayed as the triumph of politics over sound legal strategy (Robert Novak,Capital Gang ; George Will).                           Hollywood Fever: Two weeks ago, InsideWashington ian Evan Thomas disputed Gordon Peterson's claim that the filmPrimary Colors had a pro-Clinton bias, even though neither had actuallyseen the film. Now having viewed it, Thomas reports ( withoutblushing! ) that the film is sympathetic to Clinton. Peterson asksJack Germond, who has not seen the film, to give some expert commentary basedupon Germond's exposure to TV trailers for the film. Some charactersseem well-cast, responds the perplexed Germond. Rounding out the segment,Deborah Mathis says she wouldn't mind seeing Paul Newman win a Best Actor Oscaron Monday. This would be quite a trick, as Newman was not nominated thisyear.                           Will the CommentariatResign First? Charles Krauthammer prefaces his Inside Washingtoncommentary with a sigh: "I had my usual experience. I thought, my God, this isgonna do enormous damage to the president, and sure enough the American peoplethink exactly the opposite." Fred Barnes begins his Fox News Sundaysoliloquy by airing his own self-esteem issues: "There have been so many thingsthat I thought were going to have tremendous political consequences ... theyhaven't happened."                           Milli Vanilli Redux:You heard it here first, folks-- Inside Washington is lip-synced! Therewas a very creepy moment about 20 minutes into this week's installment: Thecamera cut away from Deborah Mathis, who was holding forth on school uniforms,to a presumably contemporaneous shot of the whole cast. Mathis' voice-overcontinued but the visual was of Krauthammer chatting with Peterson as a noddingand still-lipped Mathis looked on.                           --BruceGottlieb
