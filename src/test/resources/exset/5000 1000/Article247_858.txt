                                 Clinton's Back On Drugs            The LAT, NYT and WP lead with President Clinton's quickie trip to Mexico fora meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo that focused mostly on the twocountries' future plans for combating drug trafficking. USAT puts Clinton inMexico on page nine, leading instead with the Army's expected announcementtoday that it will initiate the creation of quick response "strike forces" of3,000 to 5,000 troops to ultimately replace its current World War II-eraorganization based on divisions of between 12,000 and 15,000 soldiers. The newsmaller units will be designed to better meet the exigencies of post-Cold Warthreats and scenarios. One issue not decided yet, says the paper, is whetherthe time-honored names and insignia of current divisions will survive in thenew scheme.            The backdrop to the Clinton trip is the continuing skepticism in Washingtonabout the vigor of Mexico's prosecution of the drug war. The papers takeClinton's remarks yesterday that Mexico should not be penalized for itsperformance in this area to mean that he plans to recommend later this monththat Congress again certify the country as a reliable anti-drug partner.Failure to do so, explain the NYT and LAT , would mean possibletrade sanctions against Mexico and a frosting of relations between the twocountries.            The visit also addressed non-drug matters, the papers report. The twopresidents signed agreements to increase air travel between their countries, tosuppress the spread of tuberculosis, and to improve communications between lawenforcement on both sides of the border to cut down on migrant death andinjury. And according to the two Times , both Clinton and Zedillo, intheir only public appearance of the visit, cited the success of NAFTA. In trueBeltway fashion, the WP spends most of its lead discussing the visit'sdomestic political angle--that for the first time in more than a year, Clintoncan undertake a foreign trip without being dogged by scandal. Indeed, thePost big print relegates "Mexico" to the story's subhead and nevermentions drugs or trade, opting instead for the headline: "Clinton Enters aRenewal Phase."            A WP front-pager looks beneath the veneer of Elizabeth Dole'sself-described accomplishments as head of the Red Cross to discover in hertenure there a more mixed record. Yes, she is a fund-raiser par excellence, andshe did preside over the resolution of the agency's tainted blood problems.But, the paper says a 1996 outside study of the Red Cross found Dole'smanagement style wanting and critics have noted her tendency to add politicalallies to her payroll, including Mari Masing Will, the communications directorfor her husband's 1996 campaign. Then there was the prime-time television RedCross "spectacular" made with $1.3 million of the charity's funds thatprominently featured Ms. Dole and ran eleven days before she stepped down toconsider a presidential run.            The WSJ reports that net income at companies in the Dow Jones Global stockindex rose 3 percent in the 4th quarter, a sharp improvement over the thirdquarter, which the paper takes to signify that the American consumer's appetitecontinues apace.            The NYT and LAT run front-page obits on Watergate figure JohnEhrlichman, while the WP and USAT put theirs inside. TheH-bomb-headed domestic policy maven turned criminal was convicted andimprisoned for his role in the Watergate cover-up and the burglary of theoffice of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. Henry Kissinger is quoted in theLAT epitaph saying of Ehrlichman that "he was a victim of the VietnamWar and a tough-guy atmosphere in the Nixon White House." The NYT effortcredits Ehrlichman with a bit more of a stand-up attitude than that, quotinghim saying in 1977 that he ran into trouble because "I abdicated my moraljudgments."            A reader's letter to the WP notices something telling in a previousPost story about "deadwood" federal employees. The story had mentionedthat in its effort to better understand the problem, the government's Office ofPersonnel Management had "interviewed 200 supervisors who directly managed3,114 employees. Of that total, 429 were supervisors themselves." In otherwords, notes the reader, 629 supervisors in the sample were directing the workof 2,685 nonsupervisory workers, which translates to one manager for every 4.3employees.
