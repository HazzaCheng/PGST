General theme: It's hard to balancebelt tightening and effective health care.                           Newsweek says tabloids such as the National Enquirer and Globeare losing readers. Why? "Mainstream" media have taken over their turf bycovering Princess Di's death, Flytrap, and other tablike stories. Tabloids arenow more prudish than network television, refusing to discuss the specifics ofthe Flytrap sex acts.

TheNew Yorker , Oct. 12                                       (postedTuesday, Oct. 6, 1998)                        Morecelebrity writers praise President Clinton and bash Kenneth Starr. E.L.Doctorow compares Starr to Joseph McCarthy: "Starr has shown us how aconscienceless, ideologically vindictive use of the investigative privilege canundercut the legitimacy of any duly elected American government." Bobbie AnnMason claims, "[W]e eviscerated the American government because a middle-agedman dallied with a young, willing woman and then tried to hush it up." WilliamStyron argues that "a complicity between the public and the media has generatedan ignoble voyeurism so pervasive that we have never permitted a candidate likeBill Clinton to proclaim with fury that his sex life, past and present, isnobody's business but his own." ... A story describes the breakthroughperiod of Muhammad Ali. Ali (then Cassius Clay) created his persona knowinglyand from nothing, and his defeat of Sonny Liston marked a turnaround in ourculture.

Among proposals: close banks for oneday to allow them to reorganize; institute emergency tax cuts; sack the IMF'sfailed leadership; and place emergency controls on capital flows. A relatedarticle says that all nations can't emulate the United States, soit was a given that capitalism as a single global paradigm would fail.
