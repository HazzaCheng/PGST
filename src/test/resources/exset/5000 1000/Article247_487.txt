                                 Greenback Green Cards                           USAToday leads with the scores of injuries and one death on board a UnitedAirlines jumbo jet enroute to Hawaii from Japan. The Washington Post leads with exposure of a little-knownprogram giving visas to immigrant investors. The New York Timesgoes with the revelation of a major Clinton administration domestic goal forthis year: sign up millions of children eligible for Medicaid health insurancebut not currently enrolled. The Los AngelesTimes leads with a striking drop in the Los Angeles murder rate.            The WP lead details how a U.S. immigration program enacted in 1990 reserves up to10,000 green cards a year for rich investors and their immediate families. Theprogram has led to the growth of consulting firms handling the details--theleading one boasts George Bush's brother on its board. More than 80 percent ofthese visas are going to Asians.            The Clinton push on Medicaid coverage for poor children, which will be featured in theupcoming State of the Union message, apparently came, says the Times ,after the president was dismayed to discover that most states had made littleprogress on this since he first started talking about it early last year. Thepiece is by the NYT 's long-time social policy reporter, Robert Pear, butit will be interesting to see how the Times handles any subsequentcoverage of this by its other main poor people reporter, Jason DeParle, whosewife is the administration's Medicaid expansion point person.            The LAT says that fewerpeople have been killed in 1997 in the City of Angels than in any singleyear since 1977, which, the paper reminds readers with head injuries, was whenJimmy Carter was president. The paper cites a number of factors that mightexplain the drop: a stronger economy, stabilization of the drug-trade, strictersentencing laws, improved police tactics, periodic gang truces, and a decreasein the young-adult demographic. But shouldn't the Brady Bill, with its waitingperiod and background check for any handgun purchase, also get a mention?            The LAT , USAT , the Wall Street Journal , and the NYT all run front-pageitems about Hong Kong's decision to combat that new strain of chicken flu bykilling all 1 million of its chickens. The Post runs it on p. 11. (Whatkind of soup will folks there drink when they get the flu?)            Both the WSJ and the NYT run columns wondering if the Asianeconomic downturn is good for the U.S. economy or the beginning of a recessionhere. Both pieces run through the arguments, with the Journal comingdown on the side of optimism and the Times piece, while avoiding a flatprediction of impending doom, says that with the "myth of Asian invincibility"gone, "we have lost a foundation stone." (Did you ever believe that myth?)Taken together, the two columns prove nothing so much as that the world economyis a duck-rabbit.            Today's installment in the series about women in the military that theWP started yesterday focuses on a little-noticed obstacle confrontingwomen officers trying to rise to top command jobs: a key route for getting themis serving as an aide-de-camp to those in them now, and the top brass hardlyever pick women.            Yesterday's NYT "Week in Review" contains selections from the Senate hearings on the Titanic disaster, which convenedfour days after the sinkings and hence are shot through with searing details.The lowlights include testimony that there were no binoculars on the ship andthat J. Bruce Ismay, the president of the Titanic 's parent company, wason board and, despite the inadequate number of lifeboats and thewoman-and-children-first policy, managed to get himself into one of them.            "Today's Papers" heard from many readers countering last week'sanimadversion about the WP 's use of the phrase "innocent verdict." Themain point they expressed was that, while not legally precise, "innocent" waspreferable because it doesn't run the risk of libel that "not guilty" does ifthe "not" is inadvertently dropped. Indeed, the AP style book takes this pointof view. So perhaps this column erred in calling this a "rookie mistake." It isapparently a very experienced mistake. But it should be noted that, especiallyin the case of public figures like Terry Nichols, it takes far more than adropped bit of type to constitute even a prima facie case of libel. Moreover,if this were a coherent policy, then newspapers should ban the use of "not"altogether, since dropping it always carries this same risk.
