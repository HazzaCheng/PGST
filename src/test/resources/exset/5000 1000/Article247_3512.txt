                                 Intimations of the Triple Nothing Burger                        Issue 1 is Janet Reno's admission of the use of government pyrotechnics atWaco. A distant second is abortion and the GOP.            Despite Reno's assertion that the pyrotechnics almost certainly did notcause the Waco fire, the commentariat thinks her admission hurts thegovernment's credibility and demonstrates that Reno is honest but clueless,bordering on incompetent (Steve Roberts and Susan Page, of CNN's LateEdition ; Mark Shields and Margaret Carlson, of CNN's CapitolGang ; and Fox News                Sunday's Brit Hume). Capitol               Gang's Robert Novak and Kate O'Beirne think Reno's revelation provesthat continued interest in Waco is not just the occupation of lunaticright-wingers. A few dissenters--such as Fox's Juan Williams--arguethat Waco's importance is overblown.            Several shows react to the recent abortion fudges by John McCain and GeorgeW. Bush--in which both candidates assert their pro-life bona fides whiledownplaying the importance of the issue. Tucker Carlson ( Late Edition )and O'Beirne think McCain's and Bush's balancing acts show that the pro-lifemovement is still to be reckoned with. Others, like Novak and Margaret Carlson,think that GOP elites have shifted abortion rhetoric away from the hard-linestances taken by past Republican leaders and still followed by grassrootsChristians.            ABC's This Week spends most of its round-table discussing a focusgroup it conducted of conservative New Hampshire Republicans. Among thefindings: The voters approve of George W.'s equivocations on the cocainequestion--largely because they resent the perceived arrogance of the media;they cannot agree what the correct GOP stance on abortion and gun controlshould be; and they now hate Newt Gingrich and love Bush the Elder, whom theyregret abandoning in '92. All the pundits on This Week agree that thefocus group's warm fuzzies for both Bushes underscore the GOP's shift away fromthe fiery, Reagan-invoking rhetoric of the 1995 House. Ideological purity amongthe GOP is now "as antique as the free coinage of silver," says George F.Will.                           A Carlson ChronicleSeveral weeks ago, Tucker Carlson told his fellow Late Editionpanelists that the Kansas Board of Education's decision to not mandate theteaching of evolution was sensible because it allowed for a "diversity ofviews" in the classroom. Fair enough. This week, Wolf Blitzer asks Carlson whathe makes of Al Gore's refusal to come out in favor of the mandatory teaching ofevolution. You'd think Carlson would applaud Gore's hesitancy to impose his ownviews on others. Instead, Carlson answers: "So [Gore]'s sort of a cool,rational techie on one side and kind of a snake-handling fundie on the other? Imean, this is politics. I mean, this is what I guess Gore feels like he has todo. I mean, it's another sign of the fact that his campaign is thrashing abouta bit."The Second Coming of John McLaughlin John McLaughlin isboth celebrated and notorious for ignoring the week's Top Washington Issues andinstead discussing his own idiosyncratic topics. He devoted this week's showentirely to the social, political, and economic direction of the newmillennium. (He even assembled a panel of three academic "experts" onmillennial issues.) This is a fine subject to discuss, but it renders his"Predicting the Future in 10 Words or Less" format a bit ridiculous. Typicalqueries from this week's show: "Over the upcoming millennium, will science andreligion converge, or will they annihilate one another--and if so, which onewill survive? Jerome?"; "Will the next millennium improve life for mankind--asthe current millennium has done--or will it end progress and impose restraints?Richard?"                           John McLaughlin on Post- Fin de SicleAlienationIf McLaughlin's maverick tendencies occasionally produce madness, they can alsoproduce genius (at least as far as chat TV goes). Take this piece oforatory--from a McLaughlin voice-over--delivered in his trademark stentorianslur: "When Jan. 1 rolls around, revelers will find that their lives, theirloves, are no different--after all this expense--than they were the day before.In fact, some people will see all those zeroes behind the 2 in 2000 as aTriple Nothing Burger . So, beware the post-partum millennialblues."
