                                 Landscape by Hieronymus Bosch            Not much news as Christmas week begins. Just kidding. Bill Clinton wasimpeached, Bob Livingston said he wouldn't become House speaker after all, andthe most ambitious U.S. military action in seven years came to an end. No greatmental challenges at the NewYork Times , the Washington Post , and the Los AngelesTimes about what to put on page one.            Everybody leads with Clinton's impeachment, the second of a U.S. presidentin history. The House voted to impeach the president for perjury before a grandjury (228-206) and obstruction of justice (221-212) largely along party lines.Two other impeachment votes failed: for perjury in a civil suit (defeated229-205) and for abuse of power (defeated 285-148). Just before the impeachmentvotes, a Democratic motion to bring a censure proposal to the floor also failed(defeated 230-204), winning support from only two Republicans: Maryland'sConnie Morella and New York's Peter King.            All three papers note that the Senate is unlikely to convict, which requiresa two-thirds vote. But R.W. Apple of the New York Times , remindingreaders of earlier predictions this year that impeachment would never pass theHouse on a partisan vote and that the Democrats would suffer losses in themidterm elections, warns: "In the toxic politics of century's end inWashington, the inconceivable has become the commonplace." The paper reportsthe surreal detail that while the House debated Clinton's impeachment, WhiteHouse strategists were holding a two-hour meeting to plan Clinton's State ofthe Union speech next month.            Livingston's decision not to assume the speakership (and to quit Congressnext year) is attributed mainly to pleading from his wife, but also to the furyof a small band of conservative Republican members who threatened not tosupport him in the January vote to choose a new speaker. The WashingtonPost 's David Broder, in an op-ed piece, praises Livingston's "leadership byexample" and urges President Clinton to resign. A Post editorial titled"A Challenge by Example" also praises Livingston and notes that the paper earlyon called for Clinton's resignation, but says that for Clinton to do so nowafter an irresponsible impeachment vote "would itself set a harmful precedent."The New York Times reports that many Republicans fear that whitesupremacist David Duke will run for Livingston's Louisiana seat.            The papers pronounce J. Dennis "Denny" Hastert, the little-known deputywhip, to be the likely next speaker, having quickly won the support of whip TomDeLay and majority leader Dick Armey, both of whom seem to have concluded theythemselves lacked sufficient support to win the job. The Post emphasizesthat DeLay's support is truly decisive, and that Hastert's elevation wouldfurther expand DeLay's already-impressive power base. Hastert, a well-likedmoderate from the Chicago suburbs, is known as "the coach" because he is aformer high school teacher and coach. Not much more is said about him.            The halt to air strikes in Iraq is reported to leave Saddam Hussein inpower, U.N. weapons inspectors less likely than ever before to return, and theU.S. mapping a new strategy of "containment" against Iraq, with military forcesremaining in the region indefinitely. No U.S. or British casualties are knownto have occurred during the four days of attack. Defense secretary WilliamCohen is quoted in the New York Times saying Saddam's ballistic missileprogram has been set back "by at least a year." In a New York Timesop-ed, Ronald Steel writes, "the political fallout is likely to be morebeneficial to Saddam Hussein than to the United States." In particular, heargues, economic sanctions against Iraq are less likely to be enforced bymember countries of the U.N. A "Week in Review" article in the Timesdescribes how the Iraq operation came to be named after Nazi general ErwinRommel: Under Pentagon protocol, the military command planning the operationhad to call it Operation Desert [something beginning with "s" or "f"]. Aspokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff is quoted saying, implausibly, that"nobody" recognized the connection between "desert fox" and Rommel. The storyalso says Cohen approved the name.
