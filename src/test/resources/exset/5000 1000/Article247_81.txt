                                 Did I Dis Sid? I Did!            Is Chatterbox crazy to think Sidney Blumenthal didn't get enoughfavorable publicity after he was forced to appear before Kenneth Starr's grandjury to tell prosecutors whether he was saying nasty things about them? Thesubpoena was, after all, just as outrageous as the commentariat said it was.(Does Pepperdine law school really want to give its deanship to someone whodoesn' t know the first thing about the First Amendment?) Yet when Blumenthalfinally testified last Thursday, and then denounced Starr from the courthousesteps, NBC correspondent David "Excitable Boy" Bloom poisoned Blumenthal'ssound bite by characterizing it in advance as a "tirade."... The mostgratuitously anti-Sid coverage was the front-page sneer from John M. Broder inthe New York Times . Broder's story began with this: "After a long careeras a scribbler in the shadows, Sidney Blumenthal got his moment in the suntoday... ." Now, it's true that Blumenthal was obviously loving the exposure,but so are about 80 percent of the people who appear in the New YorkTimes . That doesn't usually get them a first-graph smirk, at least whenthere are important things at stake. Imagine the respectful tone theTimes would have struck if, say, Erskine Bowles had been hauled beforethe grand jury. But the First Amendment issues would have been the same....Broder's third graph was bizarre: "A former journalist and the White House'smost celebrated conspiracy theorist, Mr. Blumenthal faced the cameras at thepeak of the Western Hemisphere's last total solar eclipse of the millennium."Chatterbox at first thought this was an adventurous metaphor for the wayBlumenthal's story had been eclipsed by the news from Iraq, or the lull in theFlytrap scandal, or by Broder's own attitude. But no. Turns out it was anin-joke--Blumenthal is a millennium freak. You can laugh now... When is anin-joke too in to run? Chatterbox's rule of thumb is that if Chatterbox doesn'tget the joke, it doesn't belong in the paper. If Chatterbox gets the joke butthe guy sitting next to Chatterbox doesn't, it's cutting-edge journalism....Why don't reporters like Sid? Not simply because when he was a political writerhe was considered pathetically in-the-tank for Clinton (see Chatterbox for2/23). It's also his standard demeanor, which features a permanentI-know-a-secret-that-I'm-not-telling-you grin.... Contacted by telephone, theTimes ' Broder denies any "personal animosity toward Sid."... Yes, that'sright, Chatterbox actually picked up the phone and called somebody for areaction. Journalism! Don't expect it to happen again...                           CORPORATISM WATCH: "There is a significant difference between askinga White House official for his sources and asking the owner of a Web page onthe Internet for his sources," Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Centeron Press and Politics at Harvard, tells the Times . "On the Drudge side,you're in uncharted waters." Meaning what? That Drudge has different [fewer?]First Amendment rights than Blumenthal? That Kalb knows how to get his name inthe papers?... It's true that the Sidney Blumenthal now being pursued by Starris the same Sidney Blumenthal who recently demanded that Matt Drudge revealhis sources. There's some hypocrisy there on Blumenthal's part. Butthere is a difference between the two situations, and it's not the offensiveDrudge-is-a-peon distinction offered by Kalb. Blumenthal was never in charge ofa grand jury criminal proceeding, the way Starr is. He is suing Drudge in civilcourt for libel, the same way any citizen can sue another citizen for libel. IfStarr had similarly sued Blumenthal for libel or slander instead of calling himbefore the grand jury (where, among other things, you're not entitled to have alawyer present during questioning), we'd have a different story on our hands.But of course Starr would never do that because he's a "public figure" andunder existing First Amendment precedents would have the same trouble provinghis case that Blumenthal will have in his suit against Drudge...
