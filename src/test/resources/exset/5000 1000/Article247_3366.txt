                                 Blair Witch's Lessons for Hollywood                        When, in its third week of release, indie sensation The Blair WitchProject took in an incredible $28.5 million at the box office and set arecord for the largest per-screen gross in motion-picture history, the majormovie studios responded by commissioning studies to explain to them why this$50,000 film was crushing all their hundred-million-dollar spectaculars. Let'shope that at the top of their list, the authors of these studies say: "Lesson1: Blair Witch was a really good movie."            I'm exaggerating, of course. Quality alone isn't enough to propel a film togreat box-office heights, as the recent failures of Out of Sight andRushmore demonstrate. But in the hubbub about the marketing of TheBlair Witch Project , which has been tremendous, it's important to keep inmind that there really is no simple formula by which hits happen, and thatattempts to reduce popular success to that kind of formula are bound to leadyou astray. In this, as in so much else, Hollywood is like the French at thebeginning of World War II: ceaselessly preparing to fight the last war, andalways getting blindsided by the next one.            What we can see in the endless analyses of Blair Witch's success ishow malleable the supposed truths of marketing and distribution are. Forinstance, the biggest Hollywood trend in distribution in recent years has beenthe mega-opening, so that films like Austin Powers and Wild, WildWest each opened on more than 3,000 screens. It was the rare multiplex thatdidn't have these movies playing on multiple screens, and these movies weresupported with multimedia marketing campaigns that drilled themselves into yourhead. Oversaturation has its perils, of course, but part of the thinking hereis that the massive opening guarantees an impressive first weekend gross (evenif not necessarily an impressive per-screen performance) and that it allowsfilms with sketchy word of mouth to make a lot of money off the initial buzz.Add to that the idea that a massive opening is a kind of PR event in itself,and you've got an argument for ensuring that consumers won't be able to goanywhere without thinking about Austin Powers .                           Blair Witch , by contrast, had a strictly limited release, playing tosell-out crowds in big cities in its first week, opening at a few more selecttheaters in its second week, and expanding to just 1,100 screens in its third.That release schedule helped build the buzz for the movie, made it seem likethe hot ticket to get (call it the "I'll only go to a club if there are a lotof people who can't get in" principle), and ensured that the distributorsdidn't overreach themselves in terms of their advertising. Now this kind ofslow build-up seems like the smart strategy.            Instinctively, the path Blair Witch trod does seem to make moresense. Though surprisingly few people in marketing will admit this, hits arerarely made. They're almost always genuine bottoms-up phenomena. (Just go backand look at the advance buzz on Titanic to see how the massive successof that film came completely out of left field.) And catering to thatgrassroots mentality by allowing word of mouth to do its work can be anexcellent approach, especially when you combine it with a brilliant use of theInternet, which is the finest tool for word-of-mouth ever created.            And yet it's worth remembering that Austin Powers , which was theanti- Blair Witch in its marketing, was a huge hit. And if Wild, WildWest hadn't opened the way it did, I doubt it would have made $20 million.Giving that film time to build would not have worked.            The banal point is that marketing and distribution campaigns really do needto be specific to the films they're intended to promote. The more complicatedpoint is that studios need to recognize just how much of what happens to theirfilms is out of their control. Which means that instead of building the MaginotLine of marketing, they should worry about the stuff that is in their control:salaries, overhead, and quality. Remember what happens when you build a bettermousetrap?
