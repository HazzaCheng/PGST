                                 Boys on Film                        Dear all,            Roger, I grew up in Chicago, where I read and watched you with admiration,and your remarks yesterday on reviewing etiquette gave both my admiration andsome dormant Chicago chauvinism a shot in the arm. I doubt too many critics inNew York squawk and swap their opinions during or even right after a screening.But I bet that too few them demonstrate the consideration for their readersthat you do, or your habitual fairness.            Elvis, you raised two really important points yesterday. The dearth ofrelationship films this year may just be a cyclical thing, I suspect.Beautifully acted but formulaic films like Walk on the Moon suggest wecould use a fallow period, a year or two to regroup and think up fresh storiesabout attraction and trust. The dearth of decent roles for black actors goesdeeper, and is much more frustrating. I'll try to see The Green Miletonight so I can join in on the debate. But I have to confess I've stayed awayso far on purpose. The preview was a turnoff, and not just because of theinnocent giant in cuffs. For me, the red alert was the sight of Tom Hanksgulping and tearing up. Hanks is a supremely effective actor, I admit, butthere are times these days when I can barely stomach him. Wherever he goes, atreacly, white-guy triumphalism seems to follow. He doesn't even have to be onscreen for this to happen. Did you all see the film he directed a few yearsback, That Thing You Do ? The main character is a teen-age drummer in aband that hits it big in the early '60s. Hanks clearly identifies with the kid,and the weirdly anti-dramatic thing is this: Nothing bad happens to himin the film. Everything he touches turns into diamonds; he gets to steal hisbest friend's girlfriend but retain the moral upper hand; everyone, evenstrangers, watches out for his happiness. As long as I live, I won't forget theending, where a black bellhop with flashing eyes and a big smile and aninappropriately loud, excitable voice takes it upon himself to fix up thiskid's love life. Jeepers, what a cringer. The film is set in '63, I guess,before the civil-rights movement kicked into really high gear, and underneaththe liberal veneer of many a Hanks film I sense some creepy nostalgia for thissimpler time.            Hanks is a bugaboo for me--sorry if I got off track. Anyway, the point I'dlike to make to Roger is that objecting to objectified characters is not amatter of p.c, of holding things up to a rigid ideological test. This is amoral problem, and an aesthetic problem, and as I said above, at times for meit is a visceral problem of not wanting to sit still for more of the oldfalse-humility routine. In this regard, I appreciate your praise of ThreeKings , Elvis. Yet I actually wanted much more screen time for Ice Cube.Even by the abstract and deconstructive standards of the film he feltunderdeveloped to me, undermotivated; complicated though he was, he remained asidekick, his decisions less closely examined and symbolically freighted andintensely presented than those of Clooney or Wahlberg.            One last, semi-related thought. Again, please don't take this in the spiritof reductive p.c.--I don't mean it that way. But don't believe the hype aboutmen being on the ropes, culturally speaking. I couldn't help noticing theunabashedly male viewpoint of many of the year's most interesting films. Withthe exception of Run Lola Run , Election , with its coolly neutral,dissecting point of view, and Boys Don't Cry , which had the fascinatingpoint of view of some androgyne god, I noticed a whole lot of guyness in thisyear's movies. I found it a little disappointing that something as humane andinnovative as The Iron Giant couldn't put a tiny bit more meat, or sass,or something, into Jennifer Aniston's part. The fearless Cameron Diaz turnedthe role of Lottie in Being John Malkovich into a miracle, but itsconception, and that of Catherine Keener the emasculator, was based on atried-and-true and rather juvenile male fantasy (or so my sources tell me).Toy Story 2 : Woody. Need I say more? There are so many more examples(highlight: Sean Penn finding peaceful, rewarding love with a deafmute ), but I'll leave you to chew it over.            This is fun.            Till soon,Sarah
