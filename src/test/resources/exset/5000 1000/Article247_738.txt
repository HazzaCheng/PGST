                                 Watch This Space            It's almost a clean sweep of the papers for John Glenn--his last Tang goleads at USAToday , the New York Times ,and the Washington Post . USAT 's front page is All Glenn Allthe Time and includes a huge spectacular blast-off photo. The Los AngelesTimes gives almost half of its front page to Glenn, but leads with thedeath of L.A. County Sheriff Sherman Block (the nation's highest paid electedofficial) from a brain hemorrhage in the midst of a re-election campaign wherethe main issue was whether he was in good health. Only time will tell if theLAT 's reporting was insufficiently aggressive when, earlier in the weekafter Block underwent emergency brain surgery, it ran a headline saying thatBlock's "survival is expected."            The papers see the Glenn launch, viewed by hundreds of thousands ofspectators and carried live on just about every television station, as a magicunifying moment for the whole country. "Captivated Nation Cheers" is how aUSAT headline puts it. The Wall Street Journal reports that 71 percent of voters holda favorable view of Glenn. And both the WP and the NYT note thatthe euphoria all but smothered criticisms that Glenn's presence was merely apublicity stunt. True, in a separate story, the Post does note that themission has marketing tie-ins (for which Glenn refused compensation)with Kodak and with Mattel's "John Glenn Action Pack"--toy figures of theastronaut cum senator cum astronaut. And the NYT follows up yesterday'scurmudgeonly editorial describing the mission as "a testament more to pasteminence than present value" with today's "Editorial Observer" saying that even Glenn's original blast-offwasn't that important. But otherwise, the NYT is pretty much in step,running no fewer than six Glenn stories inside. Remarkably, even whendiscussing the potentially dangerous loss during the launch of a protectivemetal panel, there is no mention in any of the Glenn leads of the spaceprogram's last "special" astronaut, Christa McAuliffe.            The NYT off-lead reveals that as part of the case federal prosecutorsare building against terrorists associated with Osama bin Laden, they havefiled still-secret charges against an Egyptian-born former U.S. Army Green Beret. The ex-soldieris alleged to have switched from being a U.S. anti-terrorist specialist tobeing an anti-U.S. terrorist. The article all but comes out and says the manwas a CIA asset, in that it cites his odd military record--he apparently joinedthe U.S. Army as a non-citizen while in his mid-thirties--and puts him inAfghanistan during the CIA-managed anti-Soviet insurgency there.            The LAT and NYT fronts report that yesterday, an Israelisoldier died using his jeep to take an explosion a Palestinian suicide bomberintended for a bus full of Israeli school children. (The story is carriedinside at the WP and USAT .) The papers say that the event is thefirst real test of Yasser Arafat's determination to honor his recent commitmentto increased West Bank security. He seems to have passed, by immediatelycondemning the bombing and placing the spiritual head of Hamas, the terroristgroup implicated in the attack, under house arrest. He has also rounded upother Hamas members.            The political story of the week--those Republican Lewinsky-drivenanti-Clinton ads--continues to develop on the front pages. The WPelaborates on a point first made by yesterday's NYT --that Newt Gingrichhad a hands-on role in the ad campaign. But leave it to the WSJ toobserve that for all the press hoopla, very few voters have actually seen theads, because so far, they have only aired in ten states.            Tom Shales, in his WP review of the Glenn launch television coverage,probably speaks for many when he sees the event as a magic opportunity toescape a relentless political scandal. Perhaps the LAT is wryly doingthe same when it quotes an Angeleno's description of Glenn as a hero who hasmanaged to be in the American imagination for almost 40 years "without astain."
