                                 Softwar            The two antitrust lawsuits filed against Microsoft by the Justice Departmentand twenty states lead at the New York Times ,LosAngeles Times , and Washington Post . The suits are also flagged at the top ofthe Wall Street Journal front-page news box. They arethe off-lead at USA Today (and also covered in that paper's front-page"cover story"), which leads instead with the news that in working out the $200billion highway bill, congressional negotiators dropped the provision thatwould have set a tough national drunk-driving standard.            The papers all have the same basic lawsuit details: The government and statelawyers argue that after an abortive attempt at an "illegal conspiracy" dealwith browser rival Netscape, Microsoft violated antitrust laws by using itsvirtual lock with Windows to dominate the Internet browser market. AlthoughMicrosoft has already begun shipping Windows 98, the plaintiffs have asked ajudge to issue a quick preliminary injunction requiring the company to eithertake its own browser out of that program or also include Netscape's browser.And preventing Microsoft from enforcing contracts with online service providersthat would restrict the providers from also offering their customersalternative browsers. (An area, says the NYT , that MS was apparently flexible about beforenegotiations broke down over the weekend.) The state suit additionally asks forMicrosoft to be forced to change the way it sells its "Office" software tocomputer manufacturers so that they would be freer to license competitors'software.            Bill Gates is quoted in the WP saying that these government demandsfor inclusion of competitors is like "requiring Coca-Cola to include three cans of Pepsi in everysix-pack." The NYT lead editorial says the analogy is bad because Cokeisn't a monopoly.            The government's papers include Microsoft internal e-mails and memos as wellas interviews and depositions of Microsoft executives, which, USAT says,the government attorneys consider smoking-gun evidence. The WP cites forinstance a memo that says it would "be very hard to increase browser share onthe merits" of the company's product, and hence that the company should"leverage Windows to make people use" it. But none of the dailies explain howthese internal documents came to be possessed by the government nor wonderabout the propriety of that. Also, although the WP and NYT listthe states suing, there is no explanation anywhere about what point there isfor the states to file their own suit, or why the other thirty states arestaying on the sidelines.            Most of the coverage is steeped in the particulars of the memos, etc. TheLAT however, takes a somewhat broader view. It calls themove against Microsoft, "one of the sharpest legal attacks on big business inthis century," and accompanies its lead with an interesting graphic depictingthe relative market shares enjoyed by American history's other celebratedanti-trust targets, IBM, AT&T, and Standard Oil. IBM's is listed at 65percent, but the other two are the same as Microsoft: 90 percent. TheLAT says that although fewer than half of Americans own a home personalcomputer and fewer still surf the Internet, the suit could throw the computerindustry and the economy into turmoil.            The LAT off-lead reports that three Mexican banks and 107 people wereindicted yesterday in Los Angeles by the U.S. on charges of laundering millionsfor Latin American drug cartels. The story is also on the WP front,while the NYT runs it inside.            The WSJ and the WP report that Kodak is set to announce a deal with AOL designed help thefilm manufacturer counteract inroads on its business being made by computerizedphotography: You bring your film into a Kodak authorized developer and thesnaps are returned digitally to your AOL account. The program will be called"You've Got Pictures."            The NYT profile of San Francisco Examiner executive editorPhil Bronstein quotes his wife Sharon Stone thusly: "He'sbig enough for me...for my intense personality, my stature in the world."
