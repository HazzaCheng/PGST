                                  R-E-S-P-E-C-T            Several months ago, whenHouse Republicans launched the case for President Clinton's impeachment, theyargued that he had committed high crimes worthy of removal from office. Lastweek, as it became increasingly obvious that this argument wouldn't persuade 67senators to expel Clinton--and might not even persuade 51 senators to letwitnesses be called--the House Republicans changed their tune. They began toargue that the Senate should call witnesses and complete the trial notnecessarily because Clinton deserved to be removed but because the Senate owedthe House a full hearing. This marks a new phase in the trial's disintegration.The prosecutors' case is no longer about us. It's about them.            Sunday on Meet thePress , the chief House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., dismissed thepublic's unshaken approval of President Clinton as "something for an abnormalpsychologist to do a dissertation on." Lauding his "13 intrepid colleagues whohave marched into the jaws of death," Hyde declared, "The Senate owes us atrial." Several Republican senators agreed that "fairness" required the Senateto let the House managers "make their case" by calling witnesses. On ThisWeek , conservative pundit Bill Kristol protested that by "saying that thistrial should be dismissed or saying that the House managers don't get a chanceto present their case" through witnesses, Senate Republicans would "discredit"the House's impeachment vote and make it appear "illegitimate."            Continuing this line of argument before the Senate Monday,Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pleaded, "We haven't had a chance to present ourcase, really." Hyde followed with a blunt rebuke to senators who were proposingto dismiss the case: "I looked at this motion to dismiss, and I was astounded,really. If the Senate had sent something similar to the House, it wouldcertainly have received such treatment as comports with comity. ... I looked inthe thesaurus about 'dismiss' and I came up with 'disregard,' 'ignore,' 'brushoff.' ... We represent the House, the other body, kind of blue-collar people,and we're over here trying to survive with our impeachment articles. ... Let usfinish our job."            By all accounts, theHouse managers' plea for respect has rallied Senate Republicans to their side.For public consumption, the senators have dressed up the respect argument intwo guises. One is precedent: "Never in the history of impeachment in theUnited States Senate has a trial been dismissed." The other is equality: "Ifthe president's lawyers needed witnesses, we would surely oblige them. Weshould do no less for the House managers."            But most Americans don't care about arcane precedents. Theydon't see why Clinton's lawyers and prosecutors can't be equally silent ratherthan equally thorough. They're not interested in what the House is "owed." Theydon't care whether House Republicans feel "ignored," "brushed off," or"discredited." In most households, the suggestion that members of Congress are"blue-collar people" fighting to "survive" in "the jaws of death" is morelikely to elicit contempt and derision than sympathy.            Sensing their isolation, the House prosecutors haveturned inward. They have narrowed their appeals first to the Senate, and then,in desperation, to Senate Republicans. Unable to convince even these fellow GOPlawmakers that numerous witnesses must be interrogated and that Clinton must befully tried for the sake of the nation, the House managers are framing the casein increasingly personal terms. Look what you're doing to us , they say.We've risked our careers to prosecute a popular president. Don't abandon us.Don't humiliate us. Don't repudiate everything we've stood for.            It's a poignant plea. But it's not the least bitmoral. A prosecution provoked by the self-absorbed neediness of an insecurepresident has degenerated into the self-absorbed neediness of an insecureHouse. How the GOP managed to replace Clinton on the shrink's couch is adissertation topic for students of abnormal psychology to ponder.
