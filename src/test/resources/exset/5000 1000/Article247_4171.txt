                                 The Overblown B2B Hype                        Even by the standards of this hyperactive stock market, Friday's initialpublic offering for FreeMarkets was staggering. The company had originallyplanned to go public at a price of $16 to $18 a share, but by the time it cameto market, the offering price had tripled to $48 a share. That was still toolow (though still impressive). The first trade was at $248 a share, and unlikethe way most IPOs trade, FreeMarkets' shares kept rising during the day,closing at $280 a share. (The shares were down $11 today. I'll take a guess andsay that was profit-taking.)            FreeMarkets' performance came as no surprise to anyone. (When investmentbanks triple the offering price on a stock, it's a good sign that the IPO isn'tgoing to crash and burn.) That's not so much because of the company itself,which essentially runs online business-to-business auctions for corporationslike General Motors. Rather, it's because investor appetite for Internetbusiness-to-business (B2B) stocks has suddenly become voracious. B2B is, we'rebeing told, the true wave of the future on the Web, and so companies rangingfrom professional services firms to infrastructure providers to databasemanagers are now the darlings of the Street. Most--in fact, nearly all--ofthese companies remain unknown to just about everyone in America. But over thepast few months you could have made a huge amount of money in stocks likeAkamai, Ariba, Sapient, and Viant.            There are, as usual, a host of studies by various research groups to justifythe swing in sentiment toward B2B stocks. There have to be, because many ofthese companies are currently so tiny that estimating their present value onthe basis of their internal numbers alone would be futile. (FreeMarkets, forinstance, did $7.8 million in revenue last year but now has a marketcapitalization of $9.1 billion.) In any case, these studies all show that theB2B market for goods and services on the Web will soon dwarf the B2C(business-to-consumer) market. One recent estimate, cited by FreeMarkets in itsprospectus, has the B2B market growing from $109 billion this year to $1.3trillion in 2003. If you can get even a tiny slice of $1.3 trillion, thenyou're in great shape.            The idea, then, is that within five years, B2C e-commerce--that is, what allthe investors piling into Amazon.com and eToys are hoping to capitalizeon--will be only a small part of the overall e-commerce market, perhaps assmall as 10 percent. This doesn't necessarily mean that e-tailers like Amazonare doomed (as stocks, that is). But it does suggest that you'd be better offlooking at B2B stocks for the next true Internet titan.            But there is one problem with this whole theory, which is that the companiesthat are going to be doing all of the B2B buying on the Web have to make themoney with which they pay for all their purchases somewhere. And it can't justbe from selling to other businesses. In other words, at the end of the B2Bdaisy chain there have to be consumers. On CNBC last week, one analyst hypedB2B by saying (I paraphrase): "Think of all the parts that GM has to buy everyday just to keep its business going, and multiply that by all the giantcompanies out there that have to buy parts." But let's remember this: GM spendsless on parts in a year than consumers spend on GM cars. That's by definition.Otherwise, GM would go out of business. In fact, if you add up all the money GMand its suppliers spend on parts and databases and infrastructure, it's lessthan consumers spend on GM cars, again by definition.            In other words, the hype surrounding B2B has depended on the idea thatbusinesses that sell to other businesses are going to migrate to the Web whilebusinesses that sell to consumers are going to stay offline. But while B2Bbusinesses will probably migrate more quickly, and while obviously there's alot of business that will always be offline (unless we figure out a way to geta virtual haircut), it's illogical that B2B on the Web will explode while B2Cwill remain stagnant. Especially when the former ultimately depends on thelatter. The real message of the whole B2B craze, in fact, may be that we shouldtake another look at companies like General Motors. How much longer can it bebefore cars are actually being sold online (instead of through the archaicdealer structure)? And when that happens, imagine how much better GM's businesswill be.
