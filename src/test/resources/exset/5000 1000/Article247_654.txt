                                 Blast Rites            The African embassy bombings lead all papers and dominate all fronts. (Forthe second day in a row, Monica goes down in the papers--completely offeverybody's fronts.) The respective lead headlines focus on various strands ofthe story ( USA Today : "U.S. Vows Bombers Will Pay," Los AngelesTimes : "U.S. Teams Arrive in Nairobi: Blast Victims Mourned," New York Times :"Experts Starting Search for Clues in Kenya Bombing") but for the most parteverybody gets around to everything. One exception is the Washington Post lead, which exclusively brings thesedetails: the likely Nairobi bomb vehicle was turned away from the front gate ofthe embassy and sent around to the rear, where a grenade attack killed someguards before the bomb went off. The WP and NYT both report thatthe Tanzania bomb appears to have been on an embassy-owned water truck.            The papers mention that a security camera at the Tanzania embassy might havebeen pointing right at the bomb site by the building's front gate, but all butUSAT also mention that it is not known if the camera was recording tovideo or just monitoring.                           USAT runs an excellent news section "cover story" on the beginnings of thebombing investigation. Many papers have been reporting that one focus sofar is Afghan-based Saudi Arabian financier Osama bin Laden, but thisUSAT story adds that a team of FBI and CIA officials went to Pakistanearlier this year to investigate arresting him.            Everybody notes that the twelfth American victim identified was the consulgeneral at the Nairobi Embassy, Julian Bartley, whose 20-year-old son alsoperished. Three of the four papers that run photos feature the same top-frontshot of thousands of Kenyans mourning and praying. The fourth, the NYT ,stacks a photo of a woman and her young son next to the Israeli soldier whorescued them over a shot of a woman's body being loaded into a vehicle, alifeless arm hanging out from under her shroud. The coverage reports thatbesides the 200 deaths in Kenya and the 10 in Tanzania, nearly 5,000 peoplewere injured in the two explosions, the majority of them in Kenya.            The Israeli dog-assisted victim extraction team working in Kenya continuesto get much coverage. The LAT front says that at a time when much of theworld is blaming Israel for the collapse of the Middle East peace talks, therescuers' efforts are boosting Israel's prestige and earning it goodwill.            A WP front-pager by media reporter Howard Kurtzsuggests that the story of the woman who died shortly after being told that herinsurance company would only cover a bone marrow transplant if she had it inChicago and not in Hawaii where she was--a managed-care horror story that hasbeen referred to by both Bill and Hillary Clinton in recent weeks and has alsobeen quoted by major media from ABC to Time--is of a piece with Ronald Reagan'sCadillac-driving "welfare queen." That is, writes Kurtz, there's more to thestory than appears in the Clintonic version: namely, Garvey ignored a doctor'sadvice to come in for blood tests and instead went on vacation in Hawaii, wherethe local hospital did not perform bone marrow transplants. And the health plansent a nurse to accompany Garvey back to a suitable hospital.            The Wall Street Journal reports that according to the latestLabor Dept. figures, the economy last month suffered the biggest loss offactory jobs in 16 years, a clear sign, says the paper, that the manufacturingsector is sputtering. The main cause is apparently the Asian financial crisis,which has left countries in the region unable to afford American goods.            The Journal also runs a front-page feature about a hot topic in dry-as-dust San Antonio, Texas: who usesinordinate amounts of water on their lawns. Seems that in Alamo-town, one ofthe local papers has taken to running the names, addresses, house descriptionsand water usage amounts of the top ten lawn waterers. The listees are generallyrich--they have included over the years basketball star David Robinson andcountry singer George Strait--and don't much like the cat-calling andfist-shaking (and hate mail) listing exposes them to. A recent honoree soakedup 173, 559 gallons of water in one month, more than ten times the cityaverage. No wonder four of those on the latest list persuaded the city waterdepartment to withhold their names.
