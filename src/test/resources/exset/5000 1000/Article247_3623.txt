                                 The Uses of Adversity                        Ah, Witold,            You are a gentleman, and have generously let me getaway with a couple of whoppers, which I must address before we get started onthis next round. In my zeal to defend our Andrew Ross, I've given myself thenecessity of defending Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins--from myself. Oneof the only luxuries of traditional long-form prose is the chance to read overin the morning what one thought brilliant at 3 a.m. and chuck it. But now wehave the Send key, that great enabler of the slipshod thought, and verily Ihave not mastered the button, because as soon as the coffee kicked in thismorning, I cringed at what I saw. For anyone misled by my first garbled posting(quickly corrected), Frantz and Collins did interview Eisner and Stern, and iftheir conversation did not widen to encompass the far corners of the solarsystem then that is no affront to their book, which is subtitled, after all,"Living in Disney's Brave New Town," and not "Theorizing About Creation in ItsEnormity!"            But my notes also remind me that Frantz and Collinshave themselves leapt the White Vinyl Fence when they felt the urge, and have,for instance, documented elegantly the plight of Disney workers unable toafford Celebration, who must rely on impact fees to help with their mortgages.Mea dammit culpa. It is said it is the luxury of the Internet that what theSend key giveth, the Send key can taketh away, but I still regret the error,especially in a missive declaring the requirement to respect the literaryendeavor.            The chapters on the schools in both these booksfascinated me, especially insofar as the schools, though technically under theaegis of Osceola County, Fla., were such centerpieces of Disney's design andDisney's pitch. In fact, Disney considered Celebration a campus before itconsidered it a town, at one point planning to situate the Disney Institutethere. Also, Disney may be a hard-core, bottom-line business with a wealth ofreal estate and construction experience, but because the company has been anentertainment medium for so many generations of children, and been that beforeall else, I believe the Disney fathers would locate the company's heart closerto education than town building. The school should conceivably have been thetown's one ironclad asset.            And in a curious way, it has turned out to be justthat. The question that in a real way motivates both Celebration, U.S.A. and The CelebrationChronicles is this: How does an idealized place built by a dream factoryand marketed as a utopia become real? The Celebration Company planners wantedtheir artificial creation to rise up off the gurney, but didn't know what kindof lightning bolt might galvanize their Frankenstein. Frantz and Collinsrecount Celebration's efforts to create "new traditions" throughDisney-sponsored sock hops, pumpkin carvings, parades, and crafts fairs. But inthe long run, what has worked best is what the company could not at allprovide, except inadvertently: conflict and difficulty. You ask if theCelebration's first committed crime was a setback or a victory, and your pointis well taken. Were I deputized by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office to lookinto the matter, my primary suspect would be some Disney "cast member" in acompany-supplied burglar's mask, so deftly did the crime advance the town'snecessary maturation. The school kerfuffle did the same. Ross reports,"Celebrationites encountered obstacles to happiness that compelled them toforge community bonds ... The strong community its creators had hoped for wouldcome into being as much in response to adversity as to the conveniences andadvantages built in the town's design."            It's an encouraging irony that a creation asposter-pretty and perfectly controlled as Celebration would be sparked intoreal vitality by the inevitability of a little discord, and that error wouldfavor it so. (Would that the errors of reviewers shone so well to theircredit.)            --Russ
