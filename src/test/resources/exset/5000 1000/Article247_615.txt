                                 Federal Head Case            Everybody has their own idea about the lead. USA Todaygoes with May's single-month record level of sales of new single-family homes.The New York Timesleads with a major new Serbian military assault on Albanian rebels in Kosovo, astory not on anybody else's early edition front. The Times off-lead isPresident Clinton's arrival in Shanghai and his anticipated contact withordinary citizens there. The Los Angeles Times leads with the Californialegislature's passage of a bill protecting employees over age 40 from beingreplaced by younger and hence lower-paid workers purely on grounds of age. TheWashington Post goes with the decision byWashington, D.C. and Baltimore to make a joint bid for hosting the 2012Olympics. But both papers give prime above-the-fold space to President Clintonin China.            If the pace of new home sales persists, says USAT , 1998's totals willbe a 35-year high. Low mortgage rates, dipping below 7 percent for 30-yearfixed-rates, are cited as a key factor. The Times Bosnia dispatch, byblue-chip foreign correspondent Chris Hedges, describes an increasingly serioussituation: Thousands of Serbian police and troops backed by artillery and tankspressing into the Albanian forces surrounding a Serbian pocket. The area isdescribed, says Hedges, by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke as "the most dangerousplace in Europe." Angry heavily armed Serbian civilians, many of whom say theyhad been pushed out of their homes recently by the Albanian rebels, appear tobe gathering to reenter their town on the heels of the military assault. Oneelderly woman clutching a small bag of her belongings gives this situationreport: "We have become Bosnia."            The you-are-there feel of the story is upset only slightly by thedisorienting avalanche of Seussian place-names in such passages as: "The policeclosed the main road from Pristina to Pec soon after dawn. Policemen on theroad to Belacevac near Obilic, northwest of Pristina, were..." The solution isto move the map that the Times runs inside to before the jump, where the firstgeographical descriptions are encountered.            The WP describes Clinton's trip to China, continuing today with acommunity leaders' roundtable in Shanghai and an appearance on a radio call-inshow(wonder how long the delay is), as an "experiment in diplomacy as personalperformance," referring to the familiar campaign stump style Clinton used intwo talks on Chinese national television. The Post story refers to Clinton'sappeals in these appearances for the expansion of individual liberties and hispolite but unambiguous condemnation of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, butthen says he's spent far more time flattering Chinese audiences thanchallenging them. The paper also points out that his many last minute speechrewrites meant that translators couldn't adequately prepare, with the upshotthat Clinton's television audiences "missed large sections of his remarks." TheLAT 's lefty columnist Robert Scheer embraces Clinton's talks, callingthem "a diplomatic feat of extraordinary proportions" of which "Nixon wouldhave been proud." But the Post 's Richard Cohen takes exception toClinton's repeated references to the Chinese-American friendship, because"China and the United States are not friends."            The NYT , USAT , and LAT fronts run reports of Monday'sarguments in federal court between Kenneth Starr and White House lawyer NeilEggleston over whether or not Clinton's discussions with government lawyersshould be shielded from Starr's grand jury. One of the reasons Eggleston citedwas that Clinton's discussions were part of a defense against possibleimpeachment proceedings. Meanwhile, as these stories and the WP mention,Linda Tripp will testify before the grand jury today. Tripp tells the Post thatshe is eager to dispel claims that she manipulated an unwitting MonicaLewinsky, or that she made the tapes to get a book deal. "I did not cultivateMonica," she tells the paper, "she cultivated me." Maybe that's why inpreparation for her grand jury appearance, says the WP 's "The ReliableSource" column, Tripp had her hair cut and colored by a stylist who used to doMonica's do.            The Wall Street Journal "Work Week" column tells how federalworker unions continue to battle for pay matching the private sector, and citesa current gap between the two calculated to be 23 percent. Surely there must besomething wrong in the figuring here: How many private sector employees do youknow who can still make $88,000 a year when they suddenly don't leave the housefor months, like Linda Tripp can?
