                                 You Don't Know Jackboots!            Chatterbox yields to no content-provider when it comes to condemning specialprosecutor Kenneth Starr's excesses--in particular, Starr's attempt tocriminalize criticism by calling Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal into the grandjury room. But the reaction to Starr's subpoena of the records of MonicaLewinsky's purchases at a Washington, D.C. bookstore has been mindlesslycritical. Former Democratic Congresswoman Pat Schroeder immediately called thesubpoena "repugnant to the Bill of Rights" and "a scenario that belongs inBaghdad." The ACLU harrumphed about "the right to buy books without governmentscrutiny," while the director of the Americans for Democratic Action drew acomparison to "some of the worst abuses under a totalitarian regime." NicholsonBaker, whose phone-sex novel Vox Monica allegedly bought, went for acute, somewhat forced sound bite by saying that "Starr should get down on hiskneepads and beg the country's pardon for undermining the Constitution in thisway." Monica's lawyer William Ginsburg charged ... well, you can imagine whatWilliam Ginsburg charged.            Everyone should calm down. Can't books be evidence? If someone bludgeonsChatterbox to death with a copy of David Halberstam's The Children ,Chatterbox hopes prosecutors will be able to check whether any of its enemiespreviously purchased that worthy tome. If someone blows up the United Nations,it's worth knowing if the prime suspect bought The Anarchist's Cookbookor Michael Reagan's book on the "New World Order." And, to pick anotherhypothetical example, if Monica Lewinsky has told Linda Tripp's tape recorderthat she, Monica, had phone sex with the president on December 3 after buying acopy of Vox , isn't Starr permitted to try to support the accuracy ofthose taped recollections by finding out if Lewinsky actually bought the bookaround that date? Were Starr trying to punish Lewinsky for her thoughts ortastes or reading habits or speech--the way he was threatening to punishBlumenthal--all the Nazis-are-coming hysteria might be justified. But there'sno evidence that's what Starr's up to, nor is it a likely scenario. ...                           STUPID CLINTON DEFENSE #2: Meanwhile, the self-humiliation of NewYork Times columnist Anthony Lewis in the service of the presidentcontinues apace. Lewis has been a reliable First Amendment defender, but hislast column suggested that judges should hold journalists in contempt (and eventhrow them in jail)if they keep publishing "stories without attribution basedon gossip, speculation and innuendo." Here is an idea that really is "repugnantto the Bill of Rights." ... Lewis proposes his censorship in order to preventsheep-like juries and judges from being swayed by publicity. The jury he'sthinking about is the Paula Jones civil suit jury. His opening example ofirresponsible press activity is the "overwhelming television and printcoverage" of Kathleen Willey's allegations. Lewis can't really be proposing tosuppress the "60 Minutes" Willey interview--which was, in truth, not a storybased on "gossip" or "innuendo" but first-person testimony about the behaviorof the president in the Oval Office, about which the voters are surely entitledto form an opinion--in order to protect a puny civil suit for money damages? Bythe end of Lewis' column you realize that yes, that's exactly what he means.... By sacrificing the ideal of informed political debate in the name of the"administration of justice," Lewis is at least hewing to his prior reputationas a pathetic court-worshipper. But a few weeks ago Lewis more or less arguedit didn't matter if Clinton lied under oath in a court case. Chatterbox wonderswhat this "don't-worry-about-perjury" principle would do for the"administration of justice." ...                           Paranoid's Corner: If Clinton really wanted to escape Flytrap forgood, here's what he'd do: Have a fresh, previously unknown woman come forwardalleging unwanted sexual advances along Jones/Willey lines. Let her story getbig play in the press. Let her have a packed, nationally-televised newsconference. Then have her confess that it was all a lie, that she was in fact atool of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy! ... Her example would not onlyretrospectively discredit Jones and Willey, it would protect Clinton byprospectively discrediting any women who might come forward in the future. Butthe Clintonites would never try this. ... Wait. ... Excuse Chatterbox for asecond ... What's that on the Drudge Report? ... Some woman named Zercher...
