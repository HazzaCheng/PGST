                                 Tapes' Last Crap            The big stories are about the promise of good things, foreign and domestic.The WP, LAT, and NYT lead with a Mideast peace deal apparently almost in sight.USAT fronts that but leads with hints from top Federal Reserve officials thatthe Fed is likely to cut interest rates again next month. The paper quotes theFed's vice-chairman and three other Federales to the effect that the centralbank is intent on keeping credit loose enough to prevent a slowdown in the U.S.economy. The WSJ flags the Fed scenario in its front-page news box.            The WP , NYT and LAT report that starting yesterdayafternoon, Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat entered into intense one-on-onebargaining. Everybody writes that the U.S.-backed land-for-peace deal has beenbasically accepted. The papers also say the two parties have arrived atcompromises regarding the Palestinian National Covenant (which currently callsfor the destruction of Israel), the arrest of suspects wanted in Israel and therelease of Palestinians from Israeli jails, but that the issue of whether ornot Arafat might declare the territory he administers an independent statestill remained a sore point. The papers report that the discussions are beingconducted under the rule that no agreed-to provisions would be final until anoverall agreement is reached.            The NYT and LAT have the most physical details about what wenton behind closed doors, right down to seating arrangements. The two papersreport that last night, President Clinton, who had been at the summit all day(accompanied, notes the LAT , by Buddy) invited King Hussein of Jordan tojoin the talks and that once there, the king delivered an impassioned speechcalling on Netanyahu and Arafat to press for peace. The papers report that thedeal being worked out involves a finishing-touches meeting a few months fromnow, probably in the Palestinian-governed Gaza Strip, with Clinton inattendance. This has not been confirmed by the White House.            Meanwhile, reports the LAT , on the West Bank, dozens of Israelisettlers blocked roads and held prayer rituals to drive home their demands thatno more land be returned to Palestinian control. And, adds the paper,Palestinians pressing for the repatriation of their relatives in Israeli jailstook to Gaza streets. And three Jewish parents who lost children to terroristattacks began a hunger strike outside Netanyahu's office.            The LAT 's "Column One" notes a trend among those arrested forInternet porn: they have a disproportionate tendency to kill themselves. Of the34 Americans arrested in a September 3rd 14-nation child porn raid, reports thepaper, four have since offed themselves. The suicides tend to be respectableswho've never previously been in any kind of trouble and are desperate to escapethe impending humiliation, like the former Air Force pilot in Maine whoasphyxiated himself, the University of Connecticut microbiologist who slashedhis wrists, or the Colorado computer consultant who shot himself in thehead.            Both the NYT and WP report that, according to a study releasedyesterday, 1.4 million black men--13 percent of all black men--are ineligibleto vote in the election next month because of a felony conviction. ThePost says this is seven times the national average. The study found thatthe proportion of black males in prison has increased ten times faster than forwhite men over the past decade.            The WSJ "Washington Wire" reports that Ken Starr's investigators arelooking into whether or not Linda Tripp's tapes were doctored. A NYTop-ed by former Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste makes the observationthat Starr's ardor about the tapes apparently has its limits: he never forinstance, called Lucianne Goldberg before his grand jury. The reason,Ben-Veniste suggests, is that her testimony might reveal that Starr knew aboutthe tapes before he swears he first heard of them--which could suggest aworking relationship with Paula Jones' legal team.            Tucked into a WP "Style" section story by Michael Powell on the SouthCarolina governor's race is this sentence: "He's angered the Bubba vote, theblack vote, the gambling vote and the anti-gambling vote and all that in justin the past few months." Notice that you can't defend the usage here byobserving that many people actually use the B-word, because a lot of thosefolks also use the N-word, which the Post would never run. No, this is aperfect illustration of the truism that there's still one group in this countrythat "respectable" people, even (especially?) sophisticated newspaper people,can slander--Southern white males. Hey, Posties , time to rework thatstyle-sheet.
