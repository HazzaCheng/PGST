                                 Dot-Com Minimalism                        By now, we're all familiar with the avalanche of dot-com advertising thatburied us last year, boosting the revenues of both Madison Avenue and the TVnetworks while bringing more than a few Internet companies to the verge ofnonexistence (since they burned huge amounts of cash in just a few months). Andsome of us, at least, are still looking forward to the myriad dot-com ads thatwill be unveiled at this year's Super Bowl. But while the story of these ads ismainly one of a desperate grab for market share and brand identity via thefamiliar techniques of jittery cameras, hyperbolic humor, and some measure ofassociation with that ineffable quality we now call "extreme-ness," the mostinteresting new Internet ad campaign offers none of these.            That campaign, which debuted a couple of weeks ago and has yet to attractmuch notice, is advertising Internet discount retailer buy.com. And that ispretty much all the campaign advertises. In contrast to the frenetic style ofmost dot-com ads (which have produced some true gems, including most obviouslyOutpost.com's pack of ravenous wolves and flying gerbils, and the E*Trade andAmeritrade campaigns), the buy.com TV ad features the company's name in small,white lower-case letters on a black background. That's it. No music, novoice-over, no sound. Just 30 seconds of a name and silence. The company isalso doing print and outdoor ads following the same motif, but no radio ads.(It seems hard to believe a radio station would accept an ad that consisted ofjust saying "buy.com," followed by 30 seconds of silence.)            The new campaign is an attempt to cut through all of the noise--visual andsonic--around dot-com advertising, and its visual distinctiveness willundoubtedly make people notice it. The buy.com marketing people also suggestthat the simplicity of the ads convey an implicit message that buy.com offers"convenience, simplicity, and freedom from higher prices." It's certainlypretty to think so, but the one-to-one connection there seems a bit overdrawn,unless we're meant to assume that products at buy.com must be cheap since thecompany isn't making enough profit to pay for real advertising. If anything,what really conveys those values of convenience and frugality is the company'sname, and in that sense the ads take advantage of one of buy.com's realstrengths ("strength" here being entirely a relative term).            For all this, though, you have to stop short of calling the new campaignbrilliant, mainly because it's hard to see what kind of legs it will have, atleast on television. Watching the ad the first two or even three times wasfascinating, in part because even after having seen it once, I kept expectingsomething, anything , to happen at the end of the ad. (In fact, theletters just fade out.) And there's also something compelling about the way thead makes you aware of how long 30 seconds can be. The problem is that you canonly be made aware of that so many times before you get bored. The next time Isee this ad, I'm sure I'll change the channel.            In some sense, the buy.com campaign reminds me of a stunt pulled by theshoe-gazer band My Bloody Valentine during its last U.S. tour. At some pointduring most (perhaps all) of the shows on that tour, the band would, in themiddle of a song, begin playing two notes and just continue playing them overand over for close to 20 minutes, with the sound gradually getting louder,until, as a friend of mine put it then, it sounded like you were in an airplanehangar. It may have been longer than 20 minutes, or it may have been shorter.While it was happening, it seemed like an eternity. Listening to this wasn'tenjoyable in any conventional sense, or in any sense for that matter. But therewas something incredibly interesting about being in the middle of it, and aboutthe way your reactions to what was happening changed the longer the noisecontinued. And the way the stunt exposed the conventions of the typical rockshow was adept.            This wasn't anything you needed to listen to more than once (though I knewpeople who did). Once you got the idea, re-experiencing it seemed beside thepoint, and in the same way, watching the buy.com ads again now seems beside thepoint. But perhaps this is one campaign that doesn't depend on repetition, ondriving a jingle so deep into your skull that you can't forget it. Perhaps theidea of the ad is enough to make you remember buy.com. Of course, if it workswe're going to have a flood of these campaigns, in which case you won't be ableto remember any of them. Here's one place where the first-mover advantage isactually real.
