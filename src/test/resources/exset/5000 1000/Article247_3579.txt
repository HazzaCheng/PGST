                                 Sega Dreamcast Ads We'll Never See                        Unless you're a hardcore gamer, you may not know that today saw the debut ofSega's Dreamcast video-game console, the first 128-bit system ever (that meansit's really fast) and the last hope for a corporation that has gone from havingone of the strongest brands in the world to having the words "laggard" and"also-ran" permanently affixed to its name. But even if you haven't noticedDreamcast before today, it's a safe bet that over the next few months theproduct is going to become inescapable, since Sega is in the process ofspending tens of millions of dollars on an elaborate marketing campaign thatincludes, among other things, sponsoring tonight's MTV Video Music Awards.            Dreamcast is, incidentally, quite dazzling, and the NFL 2000 game from Segain particular is the most amazing sports video game ever created. But what witheven more high-powered game systems arriving next year from Sony and Nintendo,Sega can't rely on technology alone, although word of mouth should help sell alot of the consoles. And so we're getting a sophisticated, pseudo-grassroots adcampaign, with edgy graphics and oblique slogans. It's a good campaign, butit's not exactly revolutionary.            That's not surprising, since at this point in the history of marketing, itseems impossible that you might actually come across something new. The irony,though, is that the TV ads for Dreamcast that Sega has run in Japan--where thesystem was launched last November--really are like nothing you've ever seenbefore. They're self-flagellating, bitter ads that acknowledge not only Sega'spast blunders--in the early 1990s, Sega was the dominant video game maker, butit was crushed by both Sony and Nintendo when the Playstation and N64systems--but also the quixotic nature of the Dreamcast launch.            The ads star an actual senior managing director of the company, a man namedYukawa Hidekazu, who looks much like what you imagine Japanese salarymen looklike. In the first, Yukawa eavesdrops on two kids saying, "Sega video gamessuck. Playstation is much better." Melancholy, Yukawa heads to a bar, getsdrunk, and on his way home scuffles with some thugs, who beat him up. Thecommercial ends with him collapsed in the doorway of his house, as an offscreenvoice exhorts, "Come on, Mr. Yukawa, get up!"            In the second ad, Yukawa is on a remote mountaintop, dressed in a businesssuit, talking to a group of seemingly friendly children who tell him that Segahas changed for the better. "Really?" he asks, at which point the children'seyes turn black and they scream, "No, it's a joke! We don't need Sega--we wantPlaystation!" The earth then opens beneath Yukawa and swallows him, just beforehe wakes up on the floor of his office to realize that his secretary has caughthim daydreaming. The ad ends with him reflecting on his nightmare.            The later ads are slightly more hopeful, but the overriding tone, which oneSega exec calls "this sort of wacky hara-kiri approach," stays similar. Thattone has made Yukawa a cult hero. He's recorded a hit single, a love song tothe Dreamcast, and Sega printed up a limited edition of six phone cards withhis image on them. At a games conference in October, people lined up for hoursto have their pictures taken with him. Most improbable of all, the Dreamcastbox in Japan features a photo of Yukawa-san looking somehow anxious and yetcharming.            Although the Yukawa ads are startling, they make sense in the context of theJapanese veneration of what scholar Ivan Morris famously called "the nobilityof failure," as well as what Moore calls "their emphasis on culpability andaccountability." As such, they throw into sharp relief the differences betweenthe Japanese market and the U.S. market, and point up a basic problem faced bya company like Sega of America: This is an American subsidiary of a Japanesecompany, trying to target a market different from the one in which its parentsare rooted. In other words, no Yukawa ads for us.
