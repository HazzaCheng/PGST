                                 The <i>Times</i>' Simplistic Market Alarmism                        The business section of Sunday's New York Times had a quiet, butdefinitive, feel of "Apocalypse Soon," featuring as it did three differentcolumns arguing that the stock market was patently overvalued, that thisovervaluation would eventually be corrected--perhaps in the form of acrash--and that that crash would have dramatic ripple effects on the rest ofthe economy as a whole even if, as seems certain it would, the Federal Reservewere to step up and cut interest rates to keep liquidity in the system.            On a day when the Nasdaq rose 127 points to yet another record high, puttingit up 77 percent on the year, this scenario may seem more plausible than ever.But what's interesting is that even if you set the question of overvaluationaside--and it is a much more complicated question than anyone at theTimes ever seems to acknowledge--and accept that some form of marketcorrection is in the offing, it's really not clear that a major correctionwould have such a dramatic impact on the economy as a whole.            It's not clear because the evidence for a causal relationship between abooming stock market and a booming economy remains surprisingly scanty. For themost part, it's accepted that there is such a thing as a "wealth effect,"whereby some percentage of every dollar people make in the stock market isturned into consumption. But the magnitude of that wealth effect has, at leastin the past, been shown (insofar as something like this can be shown) to berelatively small, on the order of three to five cents in additional spendingper dollar. Over the past few years, as the economy has grown at a much fasterthan anticipated rate and the stock market has also risen sharply, the mediaand Wall Street seem to have assumed that the size of the wealth effect hasalso increased, and that more of every dollar in market gain is being turnedinto consumption (which in turn drives the economy). But that remains very muchan assumption that has not been proven.            Gretchen Morgenson, for instance, cites as proof of the stock market'seffect on spending a study of the past couple of years showing that retailspending and the stock market have risen quite briskly and seemingly in tandem.But contiguity is not causality. There probably is a virtuous circle at work inwhich the strength of the economy as a whole pushes up stock prices, the gainsfrom which are then put back to work in the economy. But drawing a strictone-to-one relationship between the market and consumer spending requires morework than just citing a couple of monthly numbers.            It's become easy to accept this argument, of course, because the stockmarket has taken on such tremendous cultural prominence in the 1990s, and hasbecome, in fact, the key symbol of this decade's economic boom. But it is justa symbol. Consider, for instance, that just 21 percent of Americans have moneyin the stock market outside of their retirement funds (and just 48 percent havemoney in the stock market at all). Given what we know about the way people usemental accounting in order to manage their money--putting different kinds ofmoney into different kinds of accounts, rather than thinking about their moneyas part of a single account--it's hard to believe that people are out therespending lavishly because their 401Ks, which they know they won't be touchingfor decades, are flush. And most Americans still don't have 401Ks at all.            This isn't to say that if the market were to swoon significantly theAmerican economy would not suffer, particularly since the cost of capital foryoung companies would rise and the use of stock options as compensation (whichhas helped keep down wage pressure) would be limited. But it is to say that theU.S. economy is so big and diverse, and still so driven by the consumption ofpeople with very little or nothing at all invested in the stock market, thatGDP remains a better indicator of the economy's health than the Dow does. Ifthere is an apocalypse soon, something other than the stock market will have tocreate it.
