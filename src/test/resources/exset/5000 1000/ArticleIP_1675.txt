                                 Sid Vicious and the Sex Pistol                         Pundit-turned-presidential-spinner Sidney Blumenthal, who testified beforeKenneth Starr's grand jury, is Issue 1. Calling the Blumenthal subpoenaprosecutorial overkill, the commentariat diagnoses Starr as having a chroniccase of political "tin ear," and gives the week to President Clinton.            PaulGigot (PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ) says that the Blumenthal subpoenaachieved the near impossible by making "Sid Vicious" a sympathetic character,adding, "you can't investigate the press" and hope to come out on top."Absolutely stupid," agrees Robert Novak (CNN's Capital Gang ). Starr"played right into the White House strategy" by calling Blumenthal, saysMichael Duffy (PBS's Washington Week in Review ), making the independentcounsel the issue instead of the Sex Pistol in Chief.            On Fox News Sunday , Juan Williams and Fred Barnesaccuse Clinton of subverting the Starr investigation, but their pro-prosecutorflyer plummets when fellow guest Rush Limbaugh agrees with them. (PunditCentral to Limbaugh: Read your McLuhan. TV is cooler than radio. Tone it down atad, or at least bring a froth cup when you appear before cameras.) FormerAttorney General Dick Thornburgh (CNN's Late Edition ) defends Starr'stin ear for politics as precisely what you want in a prosecutor. Yet evenThornburgh acknowledges that Starr is "overmatched" in his duel. He doesn'tunderstand the game, and the law prohibits him from fighting back inpublic.            PatBuchanan ( The McLaughlin Group ) takes the long view of theinvestigation. Starr has placed the president in "a very serious box," Buchanansays, where he is vulnerable to charges of perjury, suborning of perjury, andobstruction of justice. Meanwhile, the pundits scoff at the trial balloonreported on the CBS Evening News Friday night and semisourced to theWhite House: Clinton and Lewinsky only played kissy face.            Michael Gordon ( Washington Week inReview ) calls Kofi Annan's deal with Saddam Hussein--Issue 2--more a "trucethan a final settlement." Most of the pundits (notably Susan Page of LateEdition and George Stephanopoulos of ABC's This Week ) fall in linebehind Gordon, expressing relief that there is no war and applauding theagreement in principle, but predicting that the whole conflict will berevisited in a couple of months. The conservatives strafe the deal, because theU.N. secretary-general did the legwork. "This is what happens when yousubcontract American foreign policy," says Kate O'Beirne ( Capital Gang ).The United States is now "hostage to the secretary-general," says George Will( This Week ). Fringe artist John McLaughlin complains on his show thatthe United States is still "frozen into a military response" to the crisis,when the proper response should be more diplomacy.            Issue 3,Rep. Bill Paxon's announcement that he's leaving politics when his term ends,so shocks the pundits that some of them (O'Beirne, Al Hunt on CapitalGang ) accept his advertised reason--the standard Washington lie that hewants to spend more time with his family. O'Beirne and Hunt should be disbarredfor their simple-mindedness.                           Washington-Go-Round: Michael Duffy onWashington Week in Review : "Ken Starr was investigating the White Housefor investigating Ken Starr for investigating the White House."                           AdHominem of the Week: Mark Shields on Capital Gang : "Bob andGeraldine Novak have two lovely children who are adults and are so because, inlarge part, Bob didn't spend time on them when they were babies."                           How to Watch Washington Week inReview : Back to front. The show vainly leads each week with ahigh-minded story designed to appeal to good-government liberals. This week'stop item (yawn): the scuttling of McCain-Feingold. As usual, WashingtonWeek doesn't get around to the week's real thing (Flytrap) until thecloser. Even though Washington Week 's treatment of Flytrap isinordinately polite, it is worth watching--but only if you don't watch the restof the show first.                                             This Week WithADM ? Less than a month ago, ABC abandoned the serviceable name ofThis Week for the overfamiliar This Week                With Sam &Cokie . This week the show switched to This Week With Sam Donaldson &Cokie Roberts . Fending off its diligent and talented copy editors, PunditCentral rejects the new name as too long and too inelegant for even a firstmention. Henceforth, this column will refer to the show as This Weekuntil either Donaldson or Roberts wins top billing.                           --JackShafer
