                                 Butt Heads Butt Heads            The en masse defection of the major tobacco manufacturers from Congress'efforts at a settlement leads everywhere. The industry promises to immediatelylaunch a public relations offensive against a "coercive, Big Brother-typeCongress." The Washington Post says the campaign kicks off today withnewspaper ads reading, "We Agreed To Change The Way We Do Business . . . Not ToGo Out Of Business." Everybody quotes President Clinton's determined reaction:"They can be part of it or they can fight it," although oddly, USA Todayleaves out the most important part of his quote: "We're going to get thisdone."            The tobacco stance became official with a speech against the tough andexpensive Senate bill by the RJR CEO, Steven Goldstone, described by the papersas "aggressive" and "defiant." Goldstone is widely quoted as saying,"Washington has rushed to collect more tobacco revenues while playing thepolitics of punishment." USAT quotes him describing the process as"broken beyond repair." The Los Angeles Times adds that Goldstone raised thespecter of a thriving black market in cigarettes if the Senate bill were tobecome law.            The New York Timesand USAT point out that while Congress can proceed unilaterally in manyareas of the proposed legislation, this is problematic with the provisions thattouch on the curtailment of free speech, such as advertising restrictions.Goldstone is quoted in the Times saying that if Congress imposes theseanyway, the companies "will fight in court." Feelings are running just as highon the other side. The paper quotes the reaction of Sen. Kent Conrad: "Poorbabies." Both the NYT and WP note that Conrad expressed the ideathat all this tobacco manufacturer stridency is a stratagem designed to get thecurrent deal accepted without the addition of any harsher conditions.            The NYT is admirably clear about the context producing suchskepticism: "The tobacco industry has dissembled so often in the past--aboutwhether cigarettes cause diseases, about whether nicotine is addictive, aboutwhether they market their product to children--that people are never sure whatto make of the companies' pronouncements." Now, if only the Times hadsaid "lied" instead of "dissembled"...            The Wall Street Journal seems a little less surprised by allthis, claiming that "the reality is that tobacco companies for weeks have beenclosed out of the legislative process." The Journal also sends alongword that Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, an architect of lastsummer's original tobacco deal, says he understands the industry position andcalls on President Clinton and Congress to convene new negotiations.            And lest we forget what this is all about, the WP reports thata study in today's New England Journal of Medicinesuggests that non-smokers not only live longer, but have less sickness anddependence on others in their last years.            The WSJ and WP each run stories describing a new studypurporting to show that the differences between black and white investors areconsiderable. Among those with incomes above $50,000, only 57 percent of theblacks had money in the stock market, compared to 81 percent of the whites. Andwhile only 13 percent of the whites believed Social Security will provide atleast half their retirement income, 25 percent of blacks thought this.            The NYT front reports that President Clinton has ordered the Departments of Defense, State, andJustice to devise plans for the arrest and trial of Pol Pot, the KhmerRouge leader responsible for the death of perhaps a million Cambodians in the1970s. According to the paper, the opportunity presents itself because theKhmer Rouge, which has Pol Pot under house arrest, is in complete disarray.Hmmm...wonder if the Khmer Rouge subscribes to the Times ...            In a NYT op-ed, Andrew Sullivan assesses the career thus far of themilitary's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Sullivan notes that under thepolicy, discharges of homosexuals have increased 67 percent (80 percent if youfigure in downsizing). Bill Clinton, Sullivan observes, has now fired morehomosexuals than any other employer in America.            The front page of the NYT national edition brings word that, buoyedby the soaring approval ratings of the sex-scandalized Bill Clinton, thesex-scandalized Bob Packwood wants to get back in the game. He's thinking aboutrunning for the Oregon state legislature. "Today's Papers" has just thecampaign slogan for him: "Still Packing Wood."
