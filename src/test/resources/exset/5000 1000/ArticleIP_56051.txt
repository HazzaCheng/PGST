                                  Reduce, Reuse, Re-Quote            With the tabloids once again brimming with news ofcelebs' shrinking waistlines, Keeping Tabs almost skipped right over theStar 's recent declaration that Hollywood's quest for thinness is "reallygetting out of hand." "Just ask ultra-lean Frasier star Jane Leeves,"the Star suggested knowingly. Why ask Leeves? Because according to theStar , she's so "sick of being added to the ever-expanding list of bonyleading ladies that she's forced to eat 'more than I want' in restaurants'because I'm afraid that somebody's watching me.' " But Keeping Tabs didn'tneed to ask Leeves for her thoughts on the Tinseltown thin parade, because shealready had--in an interview with the actress that appeared in USAWeekend just before the Star hit the newsstands. Queried about themedia's criticism of her weight, Leeves said, "I've been thin my whole life. Ido now find myself in a restaurant eating more than I want to because I'mafraid that somebody's watching me, which is ridiculous." (Click here to read the rest of the interview.)            This is not the first time Keeping Tabs has caughtone of the tabs with its hand in the proverbial cookie jar. While their mostcompelling assets are those memorable pieces of journalism that certainly won'tappear anywhere else--such as last week's Globe "Then!" and "Now!"photos of Clint Eastwood's varicose veins--when it comes to filling the rest oftheir pages, the tabs are ruthless recyclers. Of course, mainstreampublications have been known to borrow a quotation or two, but they usuallygive a nod to the original source. The tabs, on the other hand, have managed toturn the brazen, uncredited filch into an art form unto itself.            Last week'sGlobe , for example, trumpeted that it had snagged "five fun facts" aboutactress Jennifer Love Hewitt "that might surprise you." The surprise, however,would only be for those who hadn't first read those same five facts--with thecorresponding identical quotes--in Robert Abele's November                   Maxim cover story about the actress. Andthat Star item about Rosie O'Donnell opening her home totrick-or-treaters seemed awfully familiar, maybe because it had appeared in theNew York Observer two weeks earlier. (Unless, of course, O'Donnellspokeswoman Jennifer Glaisek managed to remember and repeat to theStar --virtually verbatim--everything she told the Observer .)            The Star 's regular "Star Style" feature isfrequently written in a breezily intimate manner that could fool theunsuspecting reader into thinking that the celebs have actually cozied up,pajama-party style, and dished with the Star about their beauty,fashion, and health secrets. But the only person it would appear theStar has cozied up to is its research librarian. In last week's column,for example, featuring Felicity 's Keri Russell, the vast majority ofRussell's musings were cribbed word for word from a May People magazinestory and an August InStyle feature. Credit for those charming quotesabout Russell's fondness for mangoes and Eggo waffles and the fact that sheonce had bangs "three tiers high," for example, should go to People ,while it was InStyle 's Lisa Simpson who reported that Russell, an avidwalker, says she has "big, huge, happy endorphins" flowing through herbody.            This week, the Star runs a two-page "StarStyle Special" cover story ("Shania: I'm not beautiful") that claims to haveall the dirt on country superstar Shania Twain's "secret flaws" and what she'sdoing "to make herself perfect," including using a skin ointment meant forsoftening cows' udders. It didn't take long to trace the sudden interest inTwain's bovine toilette to the Nov. 2 edition of London's DailyTelegraph . The Star 's Carolyn Callahan was apparently so enamored ofthe interview Twain gave to the Telegraph that she tried to replicate itexactly: The first five quotes from Twain in her piece are identical to thosein reporter Judith Woods' original, although Woods and the Telegraph arenever mentioned. Surely Callahan just forgot in the rush of her scoop.            While we're on the subject of editorial djvu , Keeping Tabs has become strangely attached to "Tilton Talk," the partof Charlene Tilton's new Globe gossip column in which the formerDallas star spouts off about whatever strikes her fancy, with ellipsesseparating her insights from one another. Recent entries have begun "What'swith all this millennium hysteria?" and "How about those new Target ads?"Reading Tilton Talk always left Keeping Tabs with an unmistakably familiarfeeling, until it finally came to her: Tilton has clearly been paying homage tothe Larry King- USA Today school of column writing. And why not?Imitation, after all, is the sincerest form of flattery.
