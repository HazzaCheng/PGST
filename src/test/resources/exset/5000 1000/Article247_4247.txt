                                 Hollywood's Opening-Night Neurosis                        If you want to be, oh, a heretic and actually go out to the movies thisFriday night instead of staying at home watching It's a Wonderful Life,good luck finding a new--I mean, brand-spanking new--movie to watch. Therewon't be any. Either there will be movies that have been in the theaters atleast a week (and who wants to watch those on a Friday night?) or movies thatopened today (this list includes Man on the Moon, Any Given Sunday , andSnow Falling on Cedars ). But unlike every other Friday in movie history,there will be no Hollywood films opening on Dec. 24. The four that mighthave-- The Talented Mr. Ripley, Galaxy Quest , Titus , andAngela's Ashes --will instead be opening on Christmas, which in the caseof Ripley and Titus makes for a very odd combination.            The studios have explained that they aren't releasing their movies onChristmas Eve because it is one of the slowest--if not theslowest--moviegoing day of the year, and they'd rather wait and let their filmsdebut with a splash on Christmas. This sounds plausible, until you think aboutwhat the decision to release the films a day late actually means. Since moviesalways end their runs on Thursdays (or occasionally Tuesdays) regardless ofwhen those runs start, it means that these movies will have one fewer day inwhich to make money. That's not a day the studios will be able to get back atsome point. Whenever their runs end, Ripley , et al., will have runs thatare one day shorter than they otherwise would have been.            Now, the cost of showing those films for that extra day is negligible enoughthat even if only a few people show up, you'll make some money. And it isn't asif the theaters are going to be closed on Christmas Eve. They're going to beshowing something . In fact, they'll be showing Any Given Sundayand Man on the Moon , among other movies. So why would the studios make adecision to keep their films out of theaters?            The answer has everything to do with the astonishing importance that films'opening weekends have taken on in the mind of Hollywood. If you open GalaxyQuest on Friday and it turns in numbers that are disappointing relative tothe opening weekends of other comparable films, then you end up looking like aloser, even though you could quite sensibly argue that this particular Fridaythrough Sunday is not like every other Friday through Sunday. And Hollywood nowoperates under the conviction that if your films look like losers to theinsiders after their opening weekends, they will become losers in the mind ofthe public. If you open on Saturday, though, then your per-screen average willlook better, your two-day performance has a good chance of being impressive,and you can't get dragged down by the inevitably weak Friday.            This makes no sense from a business perspective, since it's analogous tosaying that Ford shouldn't sell its cars on days when it knows sales will beslow, since that will hurt month-to-month comparisons. But the openingweekend--which, to be fair, has always been disproportionately important inshaping the way studios handle films--is now of such importance that throwingaway the money that could have been made on Friday in order to make the weekendlook better somehow seems logical.            The interesting part of all this is that there isn't really much evidencethat viewers really do pay attention to those "The No. 1 film in America!"blurbs in the ads (let alone the "No. 1 comedy about androids in America!"blurbs). It's become a clich that all anyone pays attention to anymore arebox-office grosses. But it seems likely that this is a clich that is true ofthe chattering classes but not true at all of the people who actually go tomovies. After last weekend, the studios releasing The Green Mile andToy Story 2 mixed it up because Toy Story 2 claimed the topposition in weekend gross by a slim margin, even though it was The GreenMile 's opening weekend. The people behind The Green Mile essentiallysaid, "They had their turn. They should give us a break," which was odd in twoways. First, it seemed to assume that box-office position was some subjectivejudgment. And second, it assumed that finishing first would really make adifference to The Green Mile 's eventual performance. If only the guys atPixar had said: "OK, you finished first. Do you really feel better now?"
