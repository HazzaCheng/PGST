                                 DiMaggio Streak Ends            The New York Timesand Washington Post lead with the Federal TradeCommission's announcement on Monday that it has settled its antitrust suitagainst Intel Corp., just a day before the trial was to begin. The settlementis also the top non-local story at the Los AngelesTimes . USA Today , which doesn't front Intel, leads with theSupreme Court's rejection of Timothy McVeigh's appeal of his Oklahoma Citybombing conviction, a story that nobody else fronts. The appeal had allegedjury prejudice brought about by news coverage of the case. USAT explainsthat the McVeigh turn-down still leaves room for additional appeals, whichcould delay the imposition of his death sentence for years. What gets a lot oftop front space with pictures everywhere is the death of Joe DiMaggio at age 84a few months after lung surgery.            The papers explain that the central issue in the Intel case was whether it was monopolistic for the companyto require computer manufacturers to share details about their machines as acondition for their getting information about Intel chips. If the company hadgone to trial it ran the risk of being legally judged to be a monopoly, whichthe papers explain, could have many adverse legal consequences across a widerange of issues. The settlement avoids that branding in return for Intel'sagreeing to very specific provisions--not detailed in the papers--governingwhen it can withhold technological information from computer makers. Both theWP and LAT say that many thought the government's case might havebeen hard to win.            Everybody notes that the settlement, in its low-key, no-name-calling style,stands in distinct contrast to Microsoft's approach to its legal tussle withthe government, and everybody says that Intel went this way precisely to avoidthe PR beating it thinks Microsoft has been suffering. (For all the comparisonsto the Microsoft case, none of the papers explain why the one company is beingpursued by the FTC and the other by the DOJ.) The Wall Street Journal adds that Intel's irenic bent reflectsthe change of leadership at the company, from the former CEO who was a"merciless competitor and litigator" to the current one, who personallysuccessfully negotiated a longstanding patent dispute with the concern's chiefcompetitor.            One discrepancy in the LAT account of the settlement: the paper saysthe agreement calls for the company to "mend its strong-arm tactics." This isbad newspapering because the company isn't admitting it practiced strong-armtactics, and besides, the use of the phrase makes it appear as if theLAT is condemning the company, which it shouldn't really be doingwithout first adducing a great deal more evidence about Intel's practices thanit does in this story.            The NYT and WP fronts report that Wen Ho Lee, the Taiwan-bornLos Alamos lab scientist at the center of the China bomb spying controversy,was fired Monday, after being questioned by the FBI. Although not formallycharged with anything, Lee is now officially the prime suspect in the case.            Joe DiMaggio's passing draws tremendous ink volume. Besides the sprawlingfront-page coverage, there are editorials in both Times , as well as astrong op-ed presence, which includes the effort in the NYT in whichPaul Simon, of "Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?" fame, explains that whenthey met, the Yankee Clipper protested that he hadn't gone anywhere--he'd justfinished doing a Mr. Coffee commercial, not to mention being a spokesman forthe Bowery Savings Bank.            Despite the general consensus that DiMaggio was exactly the kind of quiet,workmanlike player that is practically gone from today's courts and fields, asort of anti-Rodman, if you will, it's useful to note, as the WSJ does,that in 1938 DiMaggio held out for more money (he wanted at least $40,000 andthe Yankees were offering $25,000.) And the LAT op-ed page runs thepiece he wrote right afterwards to mend the fences with the fans, in which headvances the same "if movie stars can get it, why can't I" arguments you heartoday. But clearly DiMaggio knew not only on which side his bread was buttered,but also who buttered it: his op-ed was titled "I am Lucky to Be a Ballplayer."Lest the coverage completely disappear into the metaphorical, in his WPcolumn, George Will cites some of Joe D's stunning stats. Yes, there's thefamiliar 56-game hitting streak. But there's this more recherch, one: Thenumber of times DiMaggio was thrown out in his major league career going fromfirst to third? Zero.                           Did we miss something? Today's WP runs a story under theheadline "For Alexander, '96 Loss Sowed Seeds for 2000 Victory."
