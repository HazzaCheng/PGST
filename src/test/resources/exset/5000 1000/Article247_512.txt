                                 The Zero Effect                           USAToday leads with yesterday's U.S. and worldwide stock rally. TheWashington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with the balanced budget proposed yesterday by PresidentClinton--the first such in thirty years. The New York Timesgoes with Madeleine Albright's attempt to line up Saudi support for any U.S.military operation against Iraq.            According to USAT , a 14 percent jump in Hong Kong's stock market onMonday fueled the Dow's 201 point jump. The paper also cites as a factor thespreading belief that President Clinton will survive his sex scandal. The rallyalso drove the S&P 500 above 1000 for the first time ever.            The WP lead emphasizes that the Clinton balanced budget proposal barssubstantial new spending until Social Security is fixed. The paper notes thatin contrast to most past years, this proposed budget is not arriving onCapitol Hill dead on arrival. The coverage also features various negativereactions from the likes of Trent Lott, John Kasich, and Newt Gingrich, who isquoted, "This is a budget only a liberal could love." The biggest criticism isthe budget's use of a proposed tobacco settlement to partially offset newdomestic social spending provisions. But, says the Post , according topolls, these priorities generally conform to what the voters want.            The NYT budget off-lead covers much the same ground but is a bit moresensitive to the political angle, saying the budget presents the president with"another opportunity to portray himself as absorbed in governing, and todeflect accusations that he had an affair.." The LAT also highlightspolitical considerations, saying that the budget was "designed to giveDemocrats an upper hand in November's congressional elections and provide VicePresident Al Gore with an edge as the 2000 presidential electionapproaches."            The main Wall Street Journal "Politics and Policy" piece says thatdespite opening Republican potshots, there is likely to be agreement about theprovisions dealing with child care, transportation, and tobacco taxes. TheJournal sees the big conflicts coming over the expansion of Medicare tothose younger than 65, a minimum wage increase, and national teachertesting.            The NYT lead reports that Madeleine Albright came away from her talkswith Saudi leaders with a statement of support for military action if diplomacyfails. However, the paper says, she wants more: access to Saudi air bases likethe U.S. had in Desert Storm. The Times says the Saudis might agree tolet their bases be used for support aircraft, but not bombers. While seekingsupport, Albright has, says the Times , made it clear the U.S. isprepared to go it alone. The WP discloses that Albright did win aircraftstaging permission from Kuwait and is likely also to get green-lighted byBahrain, which she visits next.            The Times also passes along word that Russian negotiators are tryingto cobble a deal that would allow an ad hoc weapons inspection of eightheretofore-off-limits presidential palace sites. But the U.S. is notenthusiastic. The LAT also puts the Albright mission on the front.            The NYT front reports that there's been a more than forty percent drop in AIDS cases, both in New York City andnationally. The trend also makes the LAT front, and is inside at theWP . The likeliest explanation: the newer drug therapies.            The NYT has today's new Whitefluid development: Monica L. visited theWhite House, not ten times as has been variously reported, but "about three dozen times" after leaving her White House job. Shewas, says the paper, usually cleared by the president's personal secretary. Thepaper's sources are officials who have either seen or been briefed about theWhite House visitation logs. Ms. L.'s Pentagon bosses say her White House tripsweren't for them. A White House spokesman wouldn't confirm the number of visitsfor the Times , although one senior official there said the number"sounds about right."            "TP" had to read yesterday's WP twice before noticing that keymembers of the Post editorial staff are apparently suffering thecerebral ill effects of too much exposure to brightly colored polyester.Witness this lead on Monday's front: "The issue of whether disabled golferCasey Martin should be allowed to use a golf cart in tournament play hascaptured the nation's imagination for weeks."            The LAT front reports that, in an attempt to highlight SouthernCalifornia's virtues as a technology marketplace, today a nickname will bechosen for the region that will figure in an aggressive marketing campaign. Thepaper says it will probably be "Tech Coast." "Today's Papers" is still partialto "Silicone Valley."
