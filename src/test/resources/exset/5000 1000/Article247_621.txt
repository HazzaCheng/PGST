                                 Rocks and Hard Places                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with a federal appeals court rulingthat Secret Service agents are not relieved from testifying before KennethStarr's grand jury by any so-called "protective function" privilege. The storyis also the New YorkTimes 's off-lead. The USAT headline--"Secret Service Staff MustTestify"--couldn't be straighter. The NYT 's adds mention of the Lewinskycase. And the Post 's highlights the political angle--"Starr Wins AnAppeal on Privilege." The Los Angeles Times , in its front-page story on thedecision, high up and succinctly describes the significance: moving Starr "onestep closer to obtaining testimony from perhaps the last impartial and crediblewitnesses in his investigation." The NYT goes with the death, aftersuddenly taking ill while meeting with U.S. envoys, of Nigeria's most prominentpolitical prisoner, Moshood Abiola. The Nigerian government has promised a fulland prompt autopsy. The story is the WP 's off-lead. The LAT leadswith the conviction of a 19-year-old Ukrainian immigrant gangbanger for themurder of Bill Cosby's son. The Cosby story also grabs the "talker" slot on theUSAT top front, and runs above the NYT fold. The WP putsit inside.            The LAT runs the Cosby story big, including a front-page picture ofdefendant Mikail Markhasev looking back at the Cosby family members who were incourt (Bill Cosby wasn't there) as his fate was announced. The story also hasthe most details from the trial evidence, such as running quotes fromMarkhasev's jailhouse letters to another inmate, in which he says that he wentto kill a drug dealer who wasn't home and then came upon Ennis Cosby fixing aflat tire, and details about how the informant who turned Markhasev in to get a$100,000 National Enquirer reward testified that the defendant told himhe'd killed Cosby. The NYT says the informant testified that "Markhasevhad said he shot a black man," while the WP says the testimony was "Ikilled a [racial epithet]." The LAT renders the confession thus: "I shotthe n-----."            The Wall Street Journal reports that the new $217 billionfederal highway program may have a problem: with the construction tradesalready stretched tight, new workers to carry it out may be hard to find.Another problem, noted by USAT in its front-page "cover story," is thatnew highway construction is apt to raise to "epidemic" proportions an alreadyhigh accident rate among rock quarry workers. This could be avoided, the papernotes, by a few hours of training for new hires. But there's a catch: federallaw prohibits enforcing safety training rules at quarries. (This brute fact isreminiscent of the paper's recent story about how you can't sue your HMO.) Theprovision has been kept in place, says the story, by a stone industry thatgives millions to congressional campaigns.            The WSJ flags its Motorola earnings story with "Motorola SurprisesAnalysts, Posting Slim Operating Profit," while the WP goes the otherway with "Motorola Reports Earnings Plunge/2nd-Quarter Operating ProfitNegligible."            "Today's Papers" is sentencing itself to the Dept. of Corrections for tworecent infractions. 1) Yesterday's column asserted that since running a storyabout a Pakistani claiming to have inside knowledge of his country's nuclearwar plans against India, USAT has not revisited the story even thoughboth the NYT and WP have reported that the man is likely a fraud.In fact, the paper has run two stories reporting on the erosion of the man'scredibility. The stories ran inside, but during a visit to the USATnewsroom, "Today's Papers" was assured that if and when the paper issues a fullretraction, it will appear, as per USAT policy, on the front page wherethe original story ran. 2) Last week, TP stated that Bill and Hillary havenever owned a home. Several real estate-oriented readers have pointed out thatthis is not true--for a few years in the early 80s they did.            Yesterday, the NYT editorialized that it was inconceivable that RoyRogers and John Wayne ever appear in the same movie. Today the paper admits itis conceivable, because it's actual: the two starred together in "DarkCommand."
