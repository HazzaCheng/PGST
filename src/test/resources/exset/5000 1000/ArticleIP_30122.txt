                                 Peddling Pedophilia                           Hey, APA: TakeYour Licks                        I can grant the dysfunction of our politicians overthe study published by the American Psychological Association, but David Plotzis being uncharacteristically soft on what is, after all, a marked instance ofusing PR doublespeak to avoid taking responsibility (""). The APA is notfessing up, and it should.            You claim that the target article is indeed adeserving target, but you don't take on the APA's culpability in publishing it.In the first place, it was a peer-reviewed article, so at least threeindependent scholars, in addition to the editor of the journal, felt that thearticle included both legitimate empirical research and a reasonabletheoretical construct. In the second place, if, as you seem to suggest in your"it was a dead letter" argument, the APA publishes articles that are not read,mean nothing, and clearly won't be taken seriously, isn't that a strikingindictment of the APA's publishing pretensions? If it wants the articles itpublishes to be taken seriously, the association should take criticisms ofthose articles seriously, and so should you.            You are not reading the APA's statement on thiswith your normal discernment. You write:"The APA distanced itself from thestudy, noting the association's long record of fighting pedophilia andinsisting that the article does not mitigate the illegality and immorality ofpedophilia." The APA's historical position on sexual abuse is perfectlyirrelevant in assessing the meaning and claims of the target article. Criticsof the article want to talk about what the article actually says, not about theAPA's historical position.            Presumably, the APAwants the articles it publishes to be taken seriously. Presumably, if the APAthinks that reconceptualizing adult-child sexual contact so that some instancesof it are no longer thought of as constituting abuse is simply a mistake, thenthe APA can come right out and say so. That the APA has conspicuously failed todo so is a major factor in motivating ongoing concern about the article.            -- LeslieGraves                        SpringGreen, Wis.                           FreeSuicide!                        I take exception toCyrus Sanai's assertion ("") that Oregonians, as seen by the actions of theirlegislature, are unintentionally "bribing people to go early" in order to saveour precious Federal Medicaid dollars. Sanai fails to mention the methodologythat is employed in determining which medical treatments will be covered.Specifically, it is not mentioned in the piece how preventable ailments receivea lower ranking, regardless of cost. In fact, it seems that Sanai wishes thereader to believe that this list was arbitrarily constructed. Nothing could befurther from the truth.            -- JonChinburg                        Keizer, Ore.                           Cracks in theFaade                        Timothy Noah's image ofthe standard old public building ("") seems to be derived from Mayan orEgyptian pyramids, Greek theaters, the Roman Coliseum, and Notre Damecathedral. A little checking might persuade you that these buildings were by nomeans the norm in the long lost Golden Age of public construction. Bydefinition, you know of them because they survived. A much larger number ofstructures put up 800 or more years ago did not survive. The ruins orthe disappeared outnumber the survivors by several thousand to one. If U.S.cities were abandoned tomorrow, would the survival rate of our public buildingsbe better or worse? I am not as certain as you are.            -- GaryBurtless                        Alexandria, Va.                           Turn Down ThoseStereotypes                        When you asked "IsStar Wars Racist?" (see ""), it caught my attention. I don't see much ofa need to accuse George Lucas of being racist. While I am fully aware of thestereotypes you pointed out and agree with you to a point, I didn't payattention to them until you brought it up. I have always felt that racism wouldeventually disappear if people like you would just drop it instead of making anissue out of it.            -- Joel Curts                        Monrovia, Ind.
