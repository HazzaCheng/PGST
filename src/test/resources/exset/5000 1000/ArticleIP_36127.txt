                                 <P>Is the &quot;Sensation&quot; Art Worth the Fuss?</P>            "What modern man wants," said the French symbolistpoet Paul Valry, "is the grin without the cat, the sensation withoutthe boredom of its conveyance." Francis Bacon was fond of this quote, andDamien Hirst and Marc Quinn are fond of Francis Bacon. Knowing this, New Yorkdealer Jeffrey Deitch suggested the title for the Brooklyn exhibition. Baconcited Valry to mean precisely that modern art, including realist art like hisown, could do without narrative, without literary values. Indeed, art had tostrive to achieve an instantaneity that bypasses laborious storytelling. Thingshave pretty much come full circle if you now think that what makesGeneration-Sensation so groovy is that they "graft" literary themes onto modernart. I can't quite think that you are being serious when you assert that loveand death and nature are themes germane to literature to the exclusionof the visual arts: There's plenty of each big theme, I'd have thought, inTitian, Rembrandt, Rubens, Picasso.            You coyly ask permission to voice the heresy thatformalism is overrated, as if we are writing in 1970 and you have somethingbrave to say. Come on, Deborah. Formalism has been the theory non gratafor quarter of a century. It has been replaced by a conceptual orthodoxy everybit as reductive and exclusionary as Roger Fry and Clement Greenberg neveractually were. The analysis of art profits nothing by a Manichaean oppositionof form and content. It is a symbiosis of form and content that makesfor satisfying aesthetic experience. Anyway, as soon as a generation of artistsor connoisseurs declares for one, the gauntlet is dropped, and the next willplumb for the other.            Incidentally, you do subscribe to oneformalist dogma. The insistence that one must see an exhibition beforehaving anything critical to say about ideas and images within it attributes agreat importance to the visceral experience of objects, an attendance to form.If the art is so much about "real life" as you praise it for being,communicating beyond the precious confines of the art world, dealing withthemes and issues that are bigger than paltry aesthetic experiences, then allcredit, surely, to Citizen Rudy for plunging right in with his criticism?            To me, Mona Hatoum, whose work you admire, is verytypical of a kind of institutionalized avant-gardist whose work sends me tosleep on my feet. Installation--her medium--is a non-starter anyway, at best apoor cousin of window dressing or stage design, simply the wrong instrument forconveying subtle ideas visually (if her ideas are subtle). Hatoum'sgrating nihilism always needs to revert to theories or story lines extraneousto the actual object to have any validity, with lots of special pleading on thefeminist and Third World fronts. It's odd that you started our correspondenceby congratulating the young Brits for their raucous theory-free and politicallyincorrect humor and you should end up with Hatoum, who could have been inventedfor October magazine (and virtually was invented by the arid Marxistjournal Third Text ).            Rachel Whiteread is vastly more interesting, to me,than Hatoum. Even with her, though, the problem remains that too much of theaesthetic decision has been taken before the work begins; that form is imposedrather than achieved. But still, I'd say to anyone earwigging thiscorrespondence that it is worth going to Brooklyn, crossing the pontificalpicket line, and breezing past the offal and Ofilis just for the clear, calm,meditative experience of Whiteread's Ghost . I've long been convincedthat it is Whiteread's masterpiece (better than her short-lived Houseand the West Broadway watertower), but I'm coming round to realizing that it isa masterpiece on any terms. So, I must say I'm grateful to Mr. Saatchi forletting me see it at his gallery, the Royal Academy at theirs, and now theBrooklyn Museum, too. It's a rare case of improvement on repeated viewings.            But let's be honest:Most of the stuff in "Sensation" evaporates even during the first viewing. Assoon as you "get" the joke, say, of Gavin Turk depicting himself in a waxworkas Johnny Rotten, in the pose of Warhol's portrait of Elvis, there is not muchleft for aesthetic uplift. As an ad man, Mr. Saatchi will be aware of theinfamous dictum of a certain master of propaganda (Goebbels) that the lierepeated often enough becomes truth. I think the critic's job is to resist theinevitable process by which junk exhibited often enough (and written aboutenough) becomes important.
