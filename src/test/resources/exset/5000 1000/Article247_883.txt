                                 This Just In: Generalissimo Maslin Is Still Dead!            BRENTWOOD -- In this town, you know you're in trouble when MadeleineAlbright's taking shots at you. A few weeks ago, the Secretary of State'sdissing Titanic -- as she did during a visit with a Chinese filmmakerthis week -- might have seemed terminally unhip. Instead, Madame Secretaryproves to be down with the Zeitgeist, providing the latest evidence of theplummeting public image of the film's writer-director, Jim Cameron.            From the moment Cameron's name was announced as Best Director at the AcademyAwards, his standing out here has been in free fall. Declaring "I'm the King ofthe World! Woo-hooo!" to a billion TV viewers will do that, I guess, especiallywhen you're quoting your own, notably un-nominated screenplay. Just days latercame his ill-advised assault on Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan'ssanctimonious anti- Titanic thumbsucker. Cameron's mad- as-hell diatribe,which called for Turan's "impeachment," got gleefully picked up by everyonefrom the newsweeklies to Doonesbury.            With more than a billion dollars in box office receipts from Titanic ,why Jim Cameron should give a rip what any critic thinks is anyone's guess, butat least he's keeping it out of his movies. The forthcomingGodzilla --from thin-skinned action guys Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin-- apparently features a Mayor Ebert who gets squashed like a bug, and asidekick named...ah, maybe you can guess. Why, fellas? Ten years ago, GeorgeLucas dubbed a two-headed Willow monster the Ebersisk and christened hisvillain General Kael. (The name of a movie bad guy usually bears closeattention. One man was seated next to screenwriter Ed Solomon at the premiereof Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey when the audience was introduced to themovie's antagonist, De Nomolos. "It's my name backwards," whispered Solomon. "Ican't believe they let me keep it in.")                           Yo, Chatterbox!
