                                 Babar's Gay Friends                        Evan:            I think you need to take another look at the relationship between George andMartha. If they're "friends rather than lovers" it's only because Martha'sholding out on George. He wants to seal the deal. Badly. It's obvious. I admitI've never seen the Nathan Lane TV version, but my kids and I just finished theunabridged, 300-plus-page George and Martha collection last night. After a deepreading of the text I can tell you that George is one of the more aggressivelyhetero hippos in American literature.            Take the scene (I believe it's in Volume 1, Book 3) in which George getscaught peeping in Martha's window as she takes a bath. Or the chapter in whichGeorge establishes the Martha Fan Club ("George, president"). George is forevergiving Martha flowers, holding her hand, gazing into her eyes. At one point hehas his missing front tooth replaced with a gold one in tribute to her. Thereis, I concede, a somewhat confusing interlude where George takes up moderndance. But it is only as a means to woo Martha. And as I recall he wears asombrero with his leotard.            In short, George isn't gay (not that there's anything wrong with that). Butif it's gay children's book characters you're searching for, look no furtherthan the Babar series. I, for one, am convinced that there's a good reason theOld Lady is a lifelong spinster. Others (my wife) disagree, so let's not evenargue that point. Instead, I suggest you get to know Bouver and Picardee, theunmarried middle-aged male friends of Babar's who rescue his youngest daughterwhen she becomes lost on a family picnic. The two live together in asuspiciously well-decorated castle on a lake outside Celesteville. They're intoyoga. They wear turtlenecks. One of them may even have a trim mustache.(Unfortunately, the book is in my daughter's room and she's asleep, so I can'tcheck.) They look like elephant versions of the Village People. They're very,very gay.            I suspect they'd be ever gayer in a television version, but I wouldn't knowbecause--here's the bombshell--my kids have never watched TV. Every time Iadmit that (which isn't very often), people give me the "Oh, so you're a BranchDavidian" look, like it's deeply weird to shield your children from television.Maybe it is, but they don't know it yet (our daughters are 5 and 6 months; ourson is almost 3), and we plan to keep the streak going until they do. At somepoint some nasty little kid at school is going to mock them for not knowingwhat Pokmon is and we'll have to crumble and introduce them to cartoons andaction-figure ads and "School House Rock" and all the rest. But I don't wantto. They're so happy with Richard Scarry and crayons. I don't want them to jointhe consumer culture. That will mean they're getting older. And that makes mesad.            Also--and here I'm going to sound like a real crank--I don't want them todevelop the same distorted attitudes about television that everyone else seemsto have. Just one example: Yesterday, the AP ran an obit with the headline"Hazel Frederick Dies at 91." I saw it and thought, Hmmm. Hazel Frederick,Hazel Frederick. The name sounds familiar. Must be some long-forgotten civilrights hero, a friend of Daisy Bates' perhaps. Then I read the story.            As it turns out, Hazel Frederick's obituary had nothing to do Orval Faubusand everything to do with TV. According to the story, one day in 1969, whileshopping in downtown Minneapolis, Frederick accidentally walked into the viewof a camera crew shooting the opening of the Mary Tyler Moore Show andwas captured on film. For years after, she could be seen every week lookingconfused as Mary Tyler Moore tossed her beret into the air.            That was it, the whole reason for the obit. The AP never even mentioned whatHazel Frederick had done with her 91 years, only that for a second and a halfshe was seen in the background of the opening scene of a television show(wearing, the AP noted, "a green coat with fur collar and matching scarf.") Herlife was significant only to the extent it had been televised. "She never got abig head about it," said her daughter. I'm surprised she didn't.            Best,Tucker
