                                 The Bill Gates Kool-Aid Test                        Dear Kara,            Sorry to get such a late start today. I find when I'm starting out on a newstory--as has been the case the last couple of days--I have a hard time evenreading the newspapers, much less absorbing the information contained within.I'm too preoccupied, too panicked. I always feel as though I'm starting way toolate, and I'll never be able to pull it off, and that this will be the storythat finally exposes me for the fraud that I really am. My wife thinks this isan utterly absurd way to go through life, for which I can offer no defense buta helpless shrug. I used to think that I would get over this feeling; now Iknow better.            Anyway ... I did want to pick up on two threads from your message thismorning. First, on the question of Bill Gates, it strikes me as completelyunarguable that his "living icon" status has been a tremendous asset toMicrosoft--or at least it did until the antitrust trial began. First, he's afounder who is much more a businessman than a technologist--he doesn't like tohear that, but it's true--so he gets to command the respect that founderscommand within companies, while also having the set of skills, rarely seen infounders, that are required to manage very big companies. It helps--a lot--thathis employees will follow him over a cliff. The classic example was when hewoke up one day and decided that Microsoft needed to devote all its energies tothe Internet. The entire company had to shift on a dime and promising projects,which people had devoted years to, were scrapped because they didn't relate tothe Internet. At a typical big company, there would have been enormousresistance. But at Microsoft, there wasn't so much as a whisper of complaint.Everybody simply got with the program, because, by God, that's what Billwanted. Competitors like to say that Microsoft employees "take the Kool-Aid,"but they probably all wish they had at least a little of that Kool-Aidthemselves.            During the antitrust trial, though, you could see the problem with that lackof independent thinking. Gates' deposition was a true abomination--he waschurlish and evasive--and precisely because he is so clearly the embodiment ofhis company, he hurt Microsoft's cause a great deal. But no one at Microsoftcould admit that obvious truth. (Instead, they blamed it on the Feds for asking"bad" questions, and the press for writing stories that simply said out loudwhat we were seeing with our own eyes.) And most of the subsequent Microsoftwitnesses brought to the trial the same set of characteristics that were sovividly on display during the Gates deposition: defensiveness, arrogance, anunwillingness to say anything straightforwardly. Fairly or not, they all lookedas though they had something to hide, just as Bill had. It's such an insularculture, ultimately, that Microsoft people have trouble even grasping questionsthat are posed from a non-Microsoft point of view. The great virtue of KenAuletta's New Yorker piece on the trial is that it really illustratedthat point wonderfully. Ken would constantly ask Gates simple, sensiblequestions--and would get an uncomprehending rant from Gates in return.Sigh.            Speaking of abominations, the Waco disclosure certainly ranks as one, on somany levels. Not long after the event, an old Texas friend of mine, Dick J.Reavis, went to work on a book about it. He was convinced that the governmenthad behaved badly--an attitude I foolish wrote off as part of his generallyanti-government bias. Boy, was I ever wrong, and was he ever right. Over theyears, it has become increasingly clear that Waco was a disaster that shouldnever have happened. It gives solace to the "off the grid" crowd. It's scarythat the FBI will tell lies for six years--six years!--before someone withfirsthand knowledge is willing to tell the truth. I can't stand people who playto those who view the government as one giant, secret conspiracy (Oliver Stone,for instance). But at moments like this one, it is hard to argue with them.            Oh, and one other thing: Isn't this just another reminder that Janet Renoranks among the worst attorneys general of all time? Sure seems that way tome.
