                                 Buckley and Quotas at Yale            Nicholas Lemann's absorbing new history of American meritocracy, The Big Test , contains an interesting anecdote aboutWilliam F. Buckley's inadvertent role, while an undergraduate at Yale duringthe late 1940s, in helping that university restrict the number of Jews andCatholics it admitted. Here is how Lemann tells the story (on page 142):                                             One year the Connecticut legislature got the idea of forbiddinguniversities to ask for information about the religion of applicants. [YalePresident A. Whitney] Griswold persuaded the student editor of the YaleDaily News , William F. Buckley, Jr., to go up to Hartford and testifyagainst the bill; Griswold told him such information would be indispensable forthe Yale Archives (though Buckley, an opponent of government regulation, didn'tneed to be persuaded very hard). A few days later, when Buckley told Yale'sCatholic chaplain about his political mission, the chaplain broke the news tohim that Yale maintained a ceiling of 13 percent on Catholics and on Jews andthat was why they needed to ask the question.                                       Lemann got one detail wrong: Griswold didn't become Yale's president until afew months after Buckley graduated, so the president in question would havebeen Griswold's predecessor, Charles Seymour. When Chatterbox asked Buckleyabout this intriguing story--which apparently has never been told before,except in a footnote to Dan A. Oren's 1985 book Joining The Club: A History of Jews andYale --Buckley was a little hazy about the details:                                             I met with Charles Seymour, ex officio as chairman of the YaleNews , once every week. I can't exactly remember whether it was he who askedme to go to Hartford or whether it was [Yale's lawyer, Frederick]Wiggin. I do remember at one point Seymour telling me that it was ridiculousnot to ask an applicant what religion his was, since "colleges are historicalresearch facilities." I exactly remember going to see Yale's counsel, theformidable Mr. Wiggin, who asked why I opposed the law. I gave the libertariananswer and he said, "You're wrong. The legislature can do anything it wants todo provided it isn't unconstitutional." He instructed me, in effect, not tostress my own libertarian line, but simply to say I had no reason to supposethat Yale had quotas.                                       Even granting that Buckley's libertarian opposition to Connecticut's FairEducation Practices bill, which never did pass, would not likely have beenaltered by the discovery that Yale did indeed have quotas, it appears thatBuckley was duped--either by Wiggin or by Seymour or by both men--intorepeating a lie that helped Yale restrict the number of Catholics (of whom hewas one) and Jews who got in. According to Oren's book, Wiggin assured Buckleythat there were no quotas. But there were quotas. Whether these wereformal quotas can't, perhaps, be proved. But against Jews there were,Oren told Chatterbox, "admissions guidelines and understandings, 'informalquotas' that had the same net effect," and these "were not relaxed until theearly '60s." Against Catholics there's less direct evidence of 'informalquotas,' but Oren got some former Yale admissions officers to admit that theircolleagues discriminated against Catholics during this period. And at leastaccording to the testimony of Yale's Catholic chaplain (as recounted byBuckley), "it was a funny 'coincidence' that exactly the same number ofCatholics and Jews were admitted into Yale."            What Chatterbox wants to know is: Why are we learning about this only now?William F. Buckley is not only a journalist, but a journalist who has writtenextensively about his own personal experiences; moreover, the first bookBuckley ever published, God and Man at Yale , was, in part, an argument thatYale should uphold its antique tradition of inculcating Christian values andbeliefs. In taking this position, Buckley ought to have noted the inconvenientfact that historically, running a Christian college (which to Yale really meanta Protestant college) meant excluding, to some extent, Catholics and Jews--andthat, a mere two or three years before publishing this book, he himself hadencountered some evidence that systematic exclusion might still going on.
