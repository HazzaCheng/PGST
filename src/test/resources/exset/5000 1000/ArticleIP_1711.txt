                                             Even the newspapers of theFrench and German intellectual establishments--Le Monde and Frankfurter Allgemeine--faced up Friday to the fact thatPresident Clinton could be in real trouble, and allowed the Monica Lewinskyscandal onto their austere, photograph-free front pages. Under the headline"Clinton in Need," printed in small Gothic script, the German paper said in aneditorial that the scandal had the makings of an American nightmare that coulddo as much damage as Watergate.            In LeMonde columnist Pierre Georges said, with Gallic hauteur, that it was"extraordinary" that the greatest democracy in the world should permit itselfthe luxury (via Paula Jones) of "a universal media course on the president'sanatomy." He added: "One can't altogether rule out that these young women maybe showing off or lying. For women, too, can sometimes lie."            An editorial in the liberal Paris newspaper Libration said that, "asusual, lots of French people will guffaw over all this fuss about a fewindiscretions." But it said the French should understand that the scandal wasnot about sex, but about truth. "We can trust American freedom ofexpression--and the First Amendment which supports it--to ensure that we arenot spared any detail, whether spicy or not, of the relations between Bill andMonica," it added. "Let's laugh, if we want to, or let's wax indignant; but letus not forget to understand."            In afront-page comment in Milan's Corriere della Sera, columnist EnnioCaretto spoke up for Clinton's presidential record, saying he had correctedthe capitalist excesses of Reaganism and that, although he stood accused ofbetraying the liberal traditions of the Democrats, he had at least--by movingto the center--kept the Right in Congress at bay. "His suspected relationshipwith Monica Lewinsky may generate sarcasm and evoke comparisons with thatbetween Lolita and Humbert, but nothing can take away from his success,"Caretto added.            In London, the conservative Daily Telegraph , whichis normally hostile to Clinton, said in an editorial that the president shouldnot step down until his guilt of either obstructing justice or suborningperjury "has been demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt." "As was illustratedby Watergate, the republic can certainly survive such traumas," theTelegraph said, "but at a tremendous cost, especially to America'sforeign relations. (South Vietnam fell largely as a result of the paralysis ofthe presidency.) The stakes are scarcely lower today, with foes such as SaddamHussein continuing to menace the international order."            TheTimes of Londonurged Clinton to follow the examples of Nixon and Reagan, who had tried torestore their reputations during the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals bythrowing themselves into foreign affairs. "Mr. Clinton has to prove toAmericans and to the world that there is a purpose to his presidency. Foreignpolicy is the proper forum for him to do so," it added. Whatever the impact onhis reputation of the present scandal, "Mr. Clinton should seek to mitigate itwith international accomplishments. As Harry Truman argued, a president is whathe has achieved, not what others think of him."            The FinancialTimes said that "what the US needs above all, and what it is probably notgoing to get, is a rapid resolution to this unhappy affair." It said that apresident under siege couldn't give the world the leadership it needed. "Thewhole build-up to next Tuesday's State of the Union speech has already beenthrown off course, and this may be just the beginning," the FT said."The media frenzy in Washington has been extraordinary to behold: there can beno rational discussion about the great policy issues so long as thislasts."            The liberal Guardian said the talk of impeachment was premature. "Impeachment is adeadly serious matter, best reserved for deadly serious offences," it said."That 'droit de seigneur' White House tradition of serial infidelity, asestablished by John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, may be as gross as it isfoolish. But it is not yet the stuff of impeachment."
