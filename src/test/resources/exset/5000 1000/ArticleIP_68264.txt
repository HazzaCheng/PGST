                                 Of Muck and Morons                           Please send your questions for publication to prudence@slate.com.                                                         DearPrudence,                                                      I need to ask you aquestion about my sister. I don't want to unload on her if her behavior isnormal, but I have my doubts. Whenever we're in a public restroom, she willwash her hands (afterward) and then take a paper towel or toilet paper to turnoff the faucets, then use it to open the door to leave. She does this so shedoesn't have to touch anything with her bare hands. How crazy is that?                                       --Sally                        Dear Sal,            You have perhaps come tothe wrong person. It has occurred to Prudie that maybe she's the secret lovechild of Howard Hughes because of her own slight phobia about germs.Actually, your sister's routine with the paper towels is merely one of takingprecautions. What is the point, after all, of washing your hands only to thentouch a surface that a non-hand-washer has touched? Prudie is so concerned forhealth, in fact, that she travels with a physician.            --Prudie, antiseptically                                             Prudie,                                                      I am the mother oftwo beautiful children (4 and 6) who were both adopted from Russia. Both wereamputees and therefore wear artificial limbs. I can't count the number of timespeople have rushed up to me and said, "Poor children, what happened?" Or worse,"What kind of drugs did you take when you were pregnant?" (This, of course, isalways in front of the kids.) My standard response is to stare calmly and ask,"Why do you need to know?" I am writing for two reasons: The first is to remindpeople that this is not a Jerry Springer society, and everyone does not havethe right to ask about a stranger's disability. The second is to ask if youhave any great retorts for these morons?                                       --J.D.                        Dear J.,            Prudie thinks you'rehandling things perfectly. If you want to enlarge your repertoire, however, youmight try saying, "I don't believe I know you," and continue on. They will getthe underlying implicit message. The important thing for you to know is thatthese foolish people who think everything is their business have their owncongenital defect: no brains.            --Prudie, righteously                                             Prudence,                                                      "" wrote askingabout his abnormal fixation on sex. Had he written you about an abnormaldrinking habit, you might have sent him to Alcoholics Anonymous. Do you notknow that there is Sexaholics Anonymous, which is a well-respected organizationdealing with fixations on sex? Send him to www.sa.org.                                       --NO NAME PLEASE                        Dear NO,            Prudie knew of thisorganization, but it didn't come to mind; perhaps an indicator that sexaddiction is less established in our society than alcoholism. Thank you forbeing a Prudie.            --Prudie, appreciatively                                             Pru,                                                      I am having whatyou'd call a philosophical argument with a friend. My position is that withoutrules and civilized, ordered behavior, life would be nasty, brutish, and short(to borrow from Hobbes). My friend believes that anarchy might be preferableand more "honest," with no imposed ordinances. His point is that if rules aredictated rather than instinctive, they are false--therefore not genuine and notworth having. What do you think about this? Maybe a word from you could settlethe matter.                                       --Philosophically Interested                        Dear Phil,            Prudie votes with you... and she's relieved, by the way, that yours was a philosophical question,because upon reading the words "nasty, brutish, and short," she thought yourletter was about her starter husband. In any case, offer your friend a veryordinary, everyday example: Imagine the flow of traffic without lights andsigns. Of course Prudie does not think traffic lights are what Hobbes had inmind (since they didn't exist then), but she has a hunch he would haveappreciated their contribution to civilization. If you need more ammunition,just point out what happened to Czolgosv, the chap who assassinated McKinley.In addition to having a name like that, he was electrocuted.            --Prudie, procedurally
