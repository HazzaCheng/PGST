Criticspounce on Pikachu and his pals: "God-awful. Bad storytelling. Retrogradeanimation ... dark, ominous and pretentious" (Jeff Giles, Newsweek ) "an unoriginal warming over of a skimpy Japanese production  an innocuous, iflengthy, commercial" (Michael O'Sullivan, the Washington Post )  "itsefforts to preach nonviolence while exploiting it are both patronizing andhypocritical" (Jack Mathews, the Daily News )  "idiotic" (Roger Ebert,the Chicago Sun-Times ). Many reviewers admit that they're powerless toinfluence the target audience and predict (correctly) that the film will be ahuge hit no matter what they say.

Anywhere But Here                (20 th Century Fox Film Corp.). SusanSarandon and Natalie Portman star as an immature mother and her responsibledaughter who reverse roles when the mom decides to move to Beverly Hills andpursue the life she has always wanted. It's a "touching but melancholyvariation on a tune we've heard many times" (Jeff Giles, Newsweek ), andreviewers seem a bit tired of the tune. The film is "simpatico enough to makethe less-than-cutting-edge nature" of the work enjoyable (Jay Carr, theBoston Globe ), but "it's unfortunate that what we are given is sostandardized and generic" (Kenneth Turan, the Los Angeles Times ).

The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc                (Columbia Pictures).Theumpteenth retelling of the Joan of Arc story gets a mere one or two swords, er,stars: "The movie is a mess: a gassy costume epic with nobody at the center"(Roger Ebert, the Chicago Sun Times ). The supporting cast may bedelightful, with John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman catching critics' eyes, butMilla Jovovich--who at the time the film was made was married to its director,Luc ( La Femme Nikita ) Besson--is not quite up to the task of playing anuanced and thoughtful Joan.

Light It Up                (20 th Century Fox Film Corp.).Weak reviewsfor this film about a group of urban high-schoolers who take a security guardhostage after an accidental shooting; they end up becoming heroes when theydemand improvements to their run-down school as conditions of the negotiations.Singer Usher Raymond earns praise as the leader of the group, but the rest ofthe cast goes largely unnoticed. The film achieves "not much more than thelevel of a passable TV movie" (Jay Carr, the Boston Globe ) and "neverquite catches fire" (Robert Koehler, Daily Variety ).

Book                                                          Gore Vidal: A Biography               ,by Fred Kaplan (Doubleday)."At least one writer will be happy with Fred Kaplan's new book: Gore Vidal,"writes William Deresiewicz in the New York Times Book Review . It's acommon note sounded in reviews of this exhaustive authorized biography--namelythat Kaplan simply reports Vidal's version of events without question. Somewonder if this is a result of having a living subject--"Kaplan doesn't push,doesn't ask discomfiting questions" (Richard Dyer, the BostonGlobe )--and note that Vidal "seems to have been able to exert hisconsiderable charm, guile, and authority over his biographer" (Martin Rubin,the Washington Times ). Several also mention that Kaplan has been beatento the punch by Vidal himself, who released his own memoir, Palimpsest ,just three years ago. (Click here to read the first chapter.)
