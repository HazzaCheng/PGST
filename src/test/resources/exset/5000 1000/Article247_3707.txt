                                 The End of Crime and the Last Squeegee Man                        Dear Ester:            You, of course, raise the issue that has split criminal justice andcriminology right down the middle in your last note--why has crime gone down?And you are right on the mark regarding the role that ideology has played inthis debate. Moreover, New York City (media center, etc.) has become the focusof this debate. The arguments against Giuliani (and Bratton and Safir),simplified, are along the lines you suggest: changing drug patterns, changingeconomic conditions, and changing drug-use patterns. Even many who concede thatpolice practices were central argue that the crime reductions came at anunacceptable cost in terms of police brutality.            My own position is considerably different than claims on either side. Again,trying to put forth a complex argument in a short note is difficult, however,let me try. As you know, long before the New York and "crime reduction"stories, I was an advocate of community policing. By that, I did not mean thatpolice should be "nicer" or that they should do, in effect, communityrelations. I argued that to deal with crime, police had to be involved withcitizens, organizations, institutions, etc., and that communities had toreclaim public spaces and control and nurture youth. To use New York City as anexample, that is exactly what happened. Think of the activities of citizengroups, business improvement districts, the transportation authority inremoving graffiti and reclaiming the subway, the restoration of Central andBryant Parks, the creation of the Midtown Community Court, etc., etc. In otherwords, New York City had been reclaiming itself for at least 15 years. And youwere right, Dinkins and Lee Brown (his police commissioner) did substantiallyincrease the number of police. Moreover, by the end of the secondDinkins-Giuliani mayoral race, both candidates were running against "squeegeemen." Also, although Giuliani and Bratton got credit for eliminatingsqueegeeing, it was Ray Kelly, Dinkins' last police commissioner, who broughtme in to lead the problem-solving exercise that figured out how to do it.            The police, however, provided the "tipping point" that accelerated a processthat you properly note: Crime had been slowly dropping for some period of time.The steepness of the drop after Giuliani and Bratton was largely unprecedentedin American history. (A large part of the dramatic nature of the drops has todo with police practices in New York City. As I am certain that you are aware,since the 1970s, NYC police have been so preoccupied with preventing corruptionthat "staying out of trouble by doing nothing" became a unique NYC art forpolice. This Bratton and Giuliani changed.)            The fact that this is a national trend and that the stories are different inmost cities I find both not surprising and comforting. Each city has begun tofind ways to reclaim public spaces and control and nurture its youth on its ownterms--Boston, San Diego, Fort Worth, etc. There is no one story, because ofthe uniqueness of each city.            But, in closing for now, I went to a fascinating discussion put on lastnight by the Manhattan Institute in NYC. It was a discussion by FrancisFukuyama (of George Mason University) and Alan Wolfe (of Boston College) aboutFukuyama's new book, The Great Disruption . The most interesting part ofthe discussion focused on "why the disruption?" For Fukuyama, it was largelythe women's movement and the pill; for Wolfe, it was the addition of "moralfreedom" to economic and political freedom; and, for Norman Podhoretz, whooffered some comments, it was the power of a set of ideas that changed thingsovernight.            And, finally, yes it would have been fun to have met before this"conversation." But, I must be off to my guest teaching. I will write againlater. Have a good breakfast.
