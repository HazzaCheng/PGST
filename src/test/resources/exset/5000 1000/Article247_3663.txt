                                 To NBC: Think Hard Before Getting Hitched                        In the wake of Viacom's acquisition of CBS, which,among other things, paired CBS' television network with Paramount'stelevision-production studio, the reigning conventional wisdom is that NBC, nowthe only network without a studio partner, needs to find one as fast as it can.(Sony and Universal are oft-mentioned candidates.) But the conventional wisdomis wrong. NBC needs a studio much less than the studios need it. Even with theerosion in popularity of broadcast television, NBC remains a real catch. Itdoesn't need to rush into the arms of the first suitor who comes along.            The vogue for vertical integration--in which a networkproduces and distributes its own shows--does reflect an important new reality,which is that since 1995 networks have been able to have a financial interestin their own programming. (From 1970 to 1995, the FCC forbade that, which iswhat made independent producers such as Carsey-Werner and Lorimar billiondollar companies.) And the studio business can be an immensely profitable onebecause of the myriad opportunities for merchandising, licensing, andsyndication. Just look at what Fox did with TheSimpsons and The X-Files . But the studiobusiness is also, by its very nature, erratic and expensive. For everySimpsons , there are three Malcolm and Eddies . It might be nice for NBC to be able to produceand own its own shows (as it already does with Dateline and the Tonight Show ). Butit's not necessary.            Just look at the numbers. NBC, which is owned by GE,brings in somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion in net income everyyear. If you valued NBC the same way the stock market values CBS or TimeWarner, it would be worth $25 billion. While the company was hurt when it lostthe NFL and had to pay through the nose to keep ERand Friends , it remains the most profitablebroadcast network, its cable properties are booming, and even its Internetstrategy appears to be taking off.            Advocates of NBC's allying itself with a studio pointto the $13 million an episode the network had to shell out to keepER and the $6 million an episode it paid for thefinal season of Seinfeld and say, "Look at themoney it could have saved." But even if NBC had a studio, there's no guaranteethat it would have made ER . Disney, for instance,has yet to produce a hit for ABC since the companies merged. More important, ifan NBC studio made ER and gave its sister network aprice break, it would be wrecking its own business.            The great delusion in the way the media write aboutvertical integration is the assumption that merging two companies makes iteconomically sensible for one to sell its products to the other below the pricethat it could charge in the marketplace. But in fact it doesn't. If Paramountstarts charging CBS less for its programs than it could get from ABC, it willbecome less valuable. And conversely, if CBS starts taking programs fromParamount that it would otherwise have rejected, it will become less valuable."A bad program is a bad program, and the only thing that happens if you put abad program on a network is that your ratings drop," says Dennis McAlpine,media analyst at Ryan, Beck. "And if you do good programming, you're going toget picked up. Vertical integration doesn't change that."            The other pro-merger argument being offered is that ifNBC owned a studio, it would have an easier time bargaining with the studiosowned by other networks, because Warner Bros. would know that if it didn't giveNBC a break on the price of ER , NBC would drive ahard bargain when it sold shows to the WB Network. This argument is, of course,crazy. No one takes less money than they can get because they might be rewardedfor their generosity later on.            In the space of 10 years, the networks have gone in andout of favor more often than the Who has mounted comeback tours. But through itall, and even with the continued erosion of viewership, one thing has remainedunchanged: Broadcast television offers unparalleled access to huge numbers ofAmerican viewers. "Fragmentation is a problem, and it will continue to be,"Barry Diller of USA Networks told me a few months ago. "But the ability toaggregate 10, 20, 30, and on a good day 40 percent of all living Americansmakes broadcast an enormously powerful medium." When the studios come calling,NBC should (and it looks right now, with its recent investment in PaxsonCommunications, as if it will) remember that.
