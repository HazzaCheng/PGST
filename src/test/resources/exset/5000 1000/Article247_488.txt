                                 The Chicken Flew                           USAToday leads with the decision by Ted Kaczynski's lawyers to abandon amental defect defense. The New York Timesand the Los Angeles Times lead with the decision by internationalbankers to allow South Korea to delay debt repayments. The Washington Post goes with a guilty plea by the world'slargest poultry company, Tyson Foods, in a political corruption case.            The USAT lead also reports on revelations that the Department ofJustice turned down Kaczynski's offer to plead guilty in return for a sentenceof life in prison, referring only to "published accounts." The paper shouldhave given credit to the NYT , which broke the story yesterday. TheWP does give that credit in its Kaczynski story, carried inside today,but not until the sixth paragraph. C'mon people! Admit it up front: Sometimesother papers get there first.            The Post story quotes a Kaczynski family lawyer asking what purposegoing for the death penalty serves "except to punish [brother] David for therest of his life." The WP also runs an editorial questioning the DOJ stance, as does the NYT . On the other hand, today's Richard Cohen column in thePost quotes badly injured Unabomber victim David Gerlernter saying, "Iwould sentence him to death....If someone handed me a gun or showed me theswitch on the chair,...I would kill him myself."            The WP 's Tyson story reports that the company pleaded guilty togiving former agriculture secretary Mike Espy $12,000 in illegal gratuities andconsented to pay $6 million in fines and costs. The gifts were given to Espywhile his department was considering poultry-related actions that portendedmillions of dollars in extra costs to the company. The NYT runs an APaccount of the matter on p.11.            The Post reports that as part of the deal, company chairman Don Tysonand his son John were granted immunity from prosecution. The Postdoesn't make the point, but this is all too typical: Something abstract calledthe "corporation" is fined while the actual executives (think what that wordmeans: people who get things done) go merrily along.            "Today's Papers" received a number of sage emails from readers pointing outan oops in yesterday's column: California's gun control climate wasn't affectedby the Brady bill because it already had in place a much stricterwaiting-and-checking statute covering handgun purchases. Still, that waitingperiod was increased in recent years to its current 15 days and it would beworthwhile for papers like the LAT to study and report on itsrelationship to the homicide decrease in L.A.            In anticipation of congressional debate on the topic early next year, theWall Street Journal serves up a primer on themarriage tax penalty--when married people end up paying more in taxes than theywould if they each were single. The Journal explains that it's actuallya fairly nuanced topic. For one thing, more married couples enjoy a marriagebonus than suffer a marriage penalty (51 percent to 42 percent). For another,it's hard to make any changes that don't create a huge drop in revenues and/oreven worse inequities: for instance, eliminating the marriage penaltystraight-out would simply lower the tax rates on most wealthier households.            The Journal quotes an academic who says that while not a primaryfactor in deciding to get married, "A $500 increase in taxes decreases theprobability of marriage by 1% or 2%," and quotes one woman who says she's justliving with her boyfriend despite their desire to marry because she doesn'twant to give the IRS an additional $3,700. On the one hand, folks like this arethinking too much--isn't marriage to the right person worth $3,700?--and on theother, they're not thinking enough. The odds are very good that if that womanand her beau got married, they would buy a house together and have at least onekid, thereby putting a huge dent in their tax bill.
