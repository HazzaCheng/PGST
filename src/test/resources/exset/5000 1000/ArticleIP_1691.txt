The death of the tobaccobill and Clinton's upcoming visit to China vie for the Issue 1 berth. SteveBrill is Issue 3. A raft of unfocused speculation about Monica Lewinsky's nextmove is Issue 4.            All the pundits save JohnMcLaughlin ( The McLaughlin Group ) agree Clinton should use his Chinatour to publicly spank the Chinese for human rights abuses. (McLaughlin thinks"Asiatic" leaders ought to be chided behind closed doors.) Eleanor Clift( The McLaughlin Group ) believes Clinton needs to flatter his hosts aswell as confront them--she terms it "a delicate dance."            SteveRoberts (CNN's Late Edition ) worries Clinton will "wimp out." Cliftpoints out that Clinton made critical comments during Jiang Zemin's recentvisit to the United States and predicts he will toe the same line in China. Allthe hot air expended on China disproves the idea that Americans don't careabout foreign policy, notes a grinning John Harris (PBS's Washington Week inReview ).            The anti-tobacco bill is dead because Big Tobacco boughtthe Republican senators, charges Margaret Carlson (CNN's Capital Gang ).True enough, agrees Al Hunt, but let's not forget that the trial lawyers boughtthe Democrats. Paul Gigot (PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ) disagrees,citing a WSJ/NBC poll taken before the industry's ad campaign that indicatespeople viewed the bill primarily as a revenue-raising instrument. Big Tobaccodidn't kill the bill, argues Gigot, the bill killed itself.            Gigot andMark Shields ( NewsHour ) agree that the big loser in the tobacco bill'sdeath is Bill Clinton. It was his chance to put something in the history books,says Shields. It proves that he is feckless, says Gigot.            Will the vote affect midterm elections? It willhurt the Republicans, predict Shields and Mara Liasson ( Washington Week inReview ). It will be "a wash," predicts Gigot, because anti-smoking voterswill be balanced by anti-tax voters. Several pundits suggest the Republicansmay backtrack by passing a slimmed-down bill to cover up their assassination ofthis one. (Jeffrey Birnbaum of Washington Week in Review terms this a"tobacco leaf" bill.)            In hissecond week as press scourge, Steve Brill remains a hot topic. (He appears onthis week's Meet the Press .) Conservatives describe his article as "notan honest piece of work" and "more than sloppiness" and Brill himself as a"slime artist," who "on fire ... will never be doused" (Brit Hume, Fox NewsSunday ; Tony Blankley, Late Edition ; Robert Novak, CapitalGang ; Tucker Carlson, The McLaughlin Group ). The middle way is bestexpressed by Howard Kurtz (NBC's Meet the Press )--he scolds Brill forundisclosed campaign contributions and for overstretching his legal caseagainst Kenneth Starr but applauds him for casting light on the media.Lars-Erik Nelson ( Meet the Press ) pronounces Brill's article "a greatpublic service for the American people."                           What on Earth Are These Two TalkingAbout? John McLaughlin dedicates the final minutes of his show to theproposition that contemporary American culture sneers at fatherhood: Men areregarded as "inseminating instruments, superfluous after that." McLaughlin'stake is accurate in "a general, nonspecific way," says Tucker Carlson. Carlsonpresumably means that anti-father thinking is a widespread belief of whichthere are no instances.                           WouldYou Say That if He Knocked on Your Door? Gigot's advice to Starr: Wheneveryou have the impulse to give an on-the-record interview, you ought to "just sitdown, take a Valium, and get over it."                           Well Said: Shields on the Brill flap:"It's an interesting story, rather than an important story."                           A Message for Kids WhoWant To Be Federal Judges Someday: The Seattle showing of Fox NewsSunday had all the usual suspects as advertisers (grain brokers,telecommunications firms, luxury car companies) as well as one unexpected spotapparently meant to keep 4- to 6-year-olds off drugs. The ad features a purplecockroach being spread on toast, all the while singing, "I'd rather eat a bigold bug, than ever take a stupid drug!"                           --BruceGottlieb
