                                 As the World Interns            The initial phase of the Clinton counter-thrust, which hit the beach on theSunday chat shows, leads everywhere. The main theme is not defend Clinton somuch as attack Starr. The TV appearances of James Carville and Paul Begala arenoted all around, as is the return to the White House of Harold Ickes, MickeyKantor, and Harry Thomasson (filming "A Place Called Hopeless?"). Everybodyalso reports that negotiations between Ken Starr and Monica L.'s lawyercontinue.                           USAToday reports that the strategy includes Clinton issuing a fresh denialat 10 AM (ET) this morning at an event focusing on his child care proposals.The Washington Post says this move was still up fordebate as it went to press.                           USAT and the Wall Street Journal state that ABC News reports thatClinton and Lewinsky were seen "in an intimate encounter" in the White House in1996. The front-page of the Los Angeles Times has this too, but with no mentionof ABC as the source.            The WP lead reveals that Clinton has directed his pollsters to findout how much the scandal has affected his standing with the public. TheNew York Timessays an internal poll has already shown a drop of 15 percentage points.Independent polls mentioned in the dailies also indicate slippage. ThePost paints a backstage picture in which anxious aides fear that thepresident is not widely believed. And, the paper says, several administrationofficials and Democrat operatives privately say they are worried that Clintonmay not be telling the truth. Some Democratic congressional staff members tellthe Post that Clinton's plan to omit all mention of the controversy fromthe State of the Union speech is "totally surreal."            The NYT lead is accompanied by a large picture of Bill and Hillarycoming out of church yesterday morning sharing a big ole laugh with theminister. (They must have really enjoyed the sermon, "The Eight Commandments.")The Times notes that in their public remarks Sunday, the pro-Clintoniteswere careful not to attack Lewinsky. "We don't want to push her into Starr'sarms," is the explanation. The paper also states that Clinton loyalists are"greatly distressed," and mentions that William Cohen recently looked unusuallydepressed and shaken. Cohen is quoted as saying in a private meeting that ifthe accusations are true, "it's all over."            Another case of staff distress is reported by the WSJ , which recountshow, at a public forum in D.C., Clinton health-care adviser Chris Jenningsbroke down in tears in the middle of a speech.            The Journal editorial "Bonfire of the Presidency" counters the suggestion comingfrom some quarters that Monica L. has an overactive imagination with thequestion, "Did a delusional 24-year-old make up the point about perjury notoften being prosecuted in civil cases?" The Journal finds all thepsychopathology in the case elsewhere: ".[T]he roots of this crisis liesomewhere in the psyche shaped by Mr. Clinton's genes, troubled childhood andlife experiences."            The story of the Pope's departure from Cuba after a five-day stay makes everybody'sfront. A big part of the stories is his condemnation of the U.S. embargo of theisland. But the pontiff also criticized Cuban atheism and called for theprotection of all Cubans' rights.            The NYT reports that a new study from the CDC shows a continuing, and in some ways,growing disparity between the health of blacks and whites. Some examples: Thenumber of diabetes cases rose 33 percent among blacks, three times the increaseamong whites. Ditto for infectious diseases. And from 1987 to 1995, the deathrate for black mothers in childbirth jumped 48 percent, compared with anoverall rate of 7.6 percent. And blacks still have two times the infantmortality rare of whites.            In light of the decision by Sonny Bono's widow to run for his congressionalseat, the LAT front page reports that among first-time House candidatesfrom 1916 to 1993, 84 percent of the widows won, while only 14 percent of theother women did.            The NYT runs an op-ed by writer JannaMalamud Smith that states "If we're going to make simplistic rules abouttruth-telling, mine would start here: Ms. Tripp should have told Ms. Lewinskywhy she invited her to lunch.. " Elsewhere on the page, AnthonyLewis makes a point in passing that's been overlooked thus far: Ken Starrfirst got Ms. Tripp to wear a wire and then used its fruits to get permissionto widen his investigation. Shouldn't the permission to widen havepreceded the wire, which was in fact the widening?
