                                 He Could Not Tell a Lie            The Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes lead with new Commerce Department indicators on the economy's1999 performance. The good news: growth remains impressive. The bad news:long-awaited signs of inflation have finally materialized, and the markets knowit. The New York Times tucks the story inside, and leadsinstead with the latest glitches in implementing the Northern Ireland peacedeal.            The papers' stories on the economic reports are virtually identical. TheU.S. economy grew 4% as a whole in 1999, but in the final quarter of the year,wage and benefits costs to US businesses swelled by a higher-than-expected1.1%. With interest rate hikes a foregone conclusion, the Dow dropped 2.6% andthe Nasdaq slid 3.77% on Friday. Analysts are predicting the Fed's 5.5% targetfor overnight interest rates to climb by as much as a half point. Theprognosticators almost sound relieved to finally touch and feel the signs ofinflation they've been expecting for months. "It's as if there's been a murder,and we still don't have the body, but now bits of DNA evidence are starting tocome in," one economist tells the LAT .            The NYT reports that the Irish Republican Army will miss its crucialMonday deadline for beginning to disarm. An impasse on disarmament couldparalyze the two-month-old power-sharing government in Belfast and mayultimately spur the UK to re-impose direct rule. The piece does not speculateon what's holding the IRA back: internal dissent, desire to alter the detailsof the signed agreement, or sheer bad faith.            In a striking contrast to today's reports about American prosperity, aNYT front-pager says that Japan has resorted to borrowing directly fromlocal banks to repay its debts. Countries in debt usually prefer raising bonds,which are cheaper to finance than regular loans, but Japan seems skittish aboutissuing new bonds, which could upset its bond market or provoke scrutiny fromcredit companies.            A WP front-pager lends credence to Bill Bradley's recent assertionsthat Al Gore has lied about his record. According to the story, Bradley hassuccessfully "identified several glaring misstatements or distortions by thevice president." Among other things, Gore contended that Bradley didn't take astand on campaign finance until he ran for president (Actually, Bradleyco-sponsored several campaign finance reform bills during his time in theSenate). This week Gore alleged that he has "always supported a woman's rightto choose." But early in his congressional career, Gore denounced abortion.            A piece on the front page of the LAT bashes President Clinton's Stateof the Union promise to use $4 billion in government funds to bridge theso-called Digital Divide between wired haves and unwired have-nots. The DigitalDivide "is all but gone," argues the story, citing several studies that showBlacks and Latinos flocking to the Internet in droves. "Despite such evidence,Washington politics, a booming economy, and an unskeptical press have combinedto raise the notion of a digital divide from a contentious statistical claim toa cause celebre," it accuses. While the piece dismisses the idea of a racialsplit between Internet users and non-Internet users, it does acknowledge gapsbased on economics and education. If this is so, then why is helping moreAmericans get online a "waste of money"?            The WP and NYT report that for the first time, the federalgovernment is admitting that workers who handled early generations of nuclearweapons were sickened by cancer-causing radiation. "In the past, the role ofgovernment was to take a hike," Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said, "and Ithink that was wrong." The story predicts that the federal government will soonhave to shell out tens of millions of dollars a year in compensation.            Yesterday the NYT reported that as part of their welfare-to-workefforts, New York City agencies have been recruiting former beneficiaries forjobs as telephone psychics. "Clairvoyance is not among the qualificationslisted on the city's recruitment flier. Any public assistance recipient with ahigh school equivalency degree, 'a caring and compassionate personality' andthe 'ability to read, write, and speak English'" could qualify, the storyreported. According to today's Times, the program was killed yesterdayafter the story raised a fit of scorn. Apparently no one was more upset thanthe professional astrologers, who consider the new recruits inadequatelyschooled in, as the president of the New York chapter of AstrologicalFederation of America put it, "astrological studies that have been around forthousands and thousands of years."
