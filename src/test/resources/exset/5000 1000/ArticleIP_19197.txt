Jeers toWendy Shalit who cannot seem to comprehend that equal numbers of women sufferfrom abuse as cause it, and similarly for men.(See the "Dialogue": "")            Particularly offensiveis Shalit's claim that men are uncivilized and must be trained. Shalit is nodoubt aware that male-bashing, although emotionally satisfying (I assume), iscounter-productive. For those of us working to create a world in which thegenders are treated equally in the workplace, take equal responsibility inmatters of sex, and treat each other socially with equal respect and dignity,the only practical approach is to start doing it. But to act as though wrongsonly matter when they happen to women, or to assume that women are never in thewrong when they have conflicts with men, is to retard progress toward a goalthat even Shalit might enjoy.                           --RichardFlint                        Chicago                           MalcolmX'd                        "" debate over JanetMalcolm's new book piqued my interest in reading it. It felt a bit too muchlike a discussion between a skeptical reader and Malcolm's publicist, however.Did Rosen really not find anything in the book that he disagreed with? (Evenpositive book reviews usually have some caveats.) I had to sympathize withFallows when he wrote that he felt he was walking out on a limb criticizingMalcolm, given her prominence and connections in journalism. Although I'm sureRosen means what he says in his remarks, his own professional connections withher made a free-flowing discussion, including criticism, highly unlikely. Rosenis a relatively new writer at The                New Yorker , where Malcolm haslong been a star. Malcolm's husband is a New Yorker editor. Perhaps nexttime, to avoid the sense that professional concerns are not hampering theconversation in The Book Club, it might make sense to choose two discussantswith no ties to the people under discussion.                           --Chris Shea                        Washington                           HistoricalInaccuracy                        Can David Plotz (andeveryone at                   Slate               ) please refrain from speaking on behalf ofHistory? In his Feb. 3 "" from the Clinton trial, he writes, "History and theAmerican people have already rendered their verdict." Sorry to be picky, butwhen precisely did Mr. Plotz speak to History? Is Mr. Plotz accuratelyreporting History's opinions? Perhaps Mr. Plotz has a tape transcript of theinterview. If so, would he make it generally available?                           --DavidMargolies                        Oakland, Calif.                           101Damnations                        I am appalled that your publication wouldever consider publishing "." As a Dalmatian owner, I have found nothing butlove and compassion from my Dalmatian. As the director of the DalmatianBoard at AcmePet.com, Your Guide to Pets on the Internet, I have founda nation of Dalmatian owners who are the happiest people I have evermet.            To quote the author,"Many of them are deaf, and all of them are dumb. They are, in short, lousypets." Excuse me, but have you ever had a Dalmatian as a part of your familyfor more than two weeks? True, Dalmatians are more hyper than most dogs, butwhat human 2-year-old isn't? Would you skin a 2-year-old because he talks babytalk too much and always seem to get into things and is harder than heck topotty train? Dalmatians are the least vocal of any dog. They only bark whenthey need to get their point across. Kind of like me. I am a quiet person untilsomeone jerks my chain a little too hard.            -- JosephSchroeder                        Weston, Ohio
