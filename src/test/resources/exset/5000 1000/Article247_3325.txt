                                 The Gilded and the Unvarnished                        Good morning, Jodi:            What a glorious, air-conditioned day here in Washington.            Even though my Rotisserie baseball team (the Nattering Nabobs) is mired inthe second division, I began my reading rounds by checking the late West Coastbox scores in USA Today . My eyes then darted over to a comment bySeattle Mariners superstar Ken Griffey Jr., in response to press commentsreportedly made by his father (baseball's original Ken Griffey). Said Griffeythe Younger: "My dad's been in baseball how many years? He knows what to sayand what not to say."            Griffey's remark conjured up the famous scene in Bull Durham in whichKevin Costner instructs a young pitcher in the art of answering all pressquestions with innocuous sports cliches. These days, as even toddlers learn howto practice "spin," virtually everyone quoted in the news knows "what to sayand what not to say." That's why I'm going to devote this morning missive tothe handful of brave souls who dared to tell truth in today's papers.            Hats off to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Dominici, who is trying toput the brakes on the Republicans' heedless zeal to pass a tax-cut bill inorder to provoke a presidential veto they can then use in the 2000 campaign. Asthe Washington Post puts it, "Dominici is concerned that the [GOP]leadership may end up with an issue but no legislation." That, of course, isexactly Trent Lott's game plan. The danger lurking just offshore like asurplus-eating shark is that Bill Clinton will ultimately agree to somethinglike a $600-billion tax cut in order to clear the decks for some sort of grandcompromise on Social Security and Medicare.            Buried inside the Post and the Times is the news that AlGore's chief of staff, Ron Klain, has resigned to become a partner withO'Melvany & Myers. It had long been rumored that Klain was about to takethe fall for the snafus that have bedeviled Gore's campaign. Kudos to KatharineSeelye, who didn't pull any punches on the Klain ouster in her short piece inthe Times . She quotes Gore staffers who recounted that in a recentmeeting Klain said he was "like a milk carton, and milk cartons have anexpiration date." But in his on-the- record comments, Klain gave a full BullDurham , claiming that "my heart said stay, but my head told me it was timeto move on."            I was deeply saddened to read of the death of Willie Morris, someone I nevermet but long admired. As a college student in the late 1960s, I remember how Ithrilled to read each issue of Harper's during Morris' tenure as editor.Peter Applebome, who wrote the Times obit, wins truth-telling points fora paragraph that began, "Mr. Morris drank too much bourbon and red wine, smokedtoo many Viceroys, stayed up too late and caroused too much."            Now for some unfinished business. Jodi, I awoke still feeling the stab marksfrom your last entry yesterday. OK, my sentence about day trading beingemblematic of the "glitz-and-greed '90s" was not worthy of being included in mycollected works. But something weird is happening out there, which makes thelate '90s different from the "junk-bond era and the Las Vegas Strip."            The Metro section of today's Washington Post features a sad storyabout the money woes and vituperative divorce proceedings of local CongressmanJames Moran. Court papers filed by attorneys for Mary Moran, the congressman'sestranged wife, allege that the northern Virginia legislator had a history of"wasting the family assets on his stock market gambling." And the WallStreet Journal , returning to the perils of day trading, begins a Page 1leader with the tale of Barbara Harkness, a retired anthropology professor, who"was seduced by the new Gilded Age." Harkness, who used to safeguard her moneyin thrift accounts, claims to have made money in the market. But, theJournal observes, "from cautious saver to citizen speculator in just adecade--that's quite a trek across the spectrum of financial risk."            Anyway, it's time for me to make a trek of my own off to a newsstand inquest of my very own inaugural issue of Talk . Something tells me that itwon't shimmer anything like Willie Morris' Harper's .            Eagerly awaiting your epiphanies from the F train.
