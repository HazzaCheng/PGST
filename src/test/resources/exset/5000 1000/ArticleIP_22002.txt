                                 &quot;Time To Clear out the Eurotrash&quot;            The mass resignation earlyTuesday morning of all 20 members of the European Commission--universallycharacterized as the most serious institutional crisis in the 42-year historyof the European community--dominated European papers Wednesday. TheBrussels-based commission is responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the15-member European Union and enforces EU law. An investigation into charges offraud, corruption, and cronyism found evidence of incompetence, mismanagement,and loss of political control. Although one commissioner, former French PrimeMinister Edith Cresson, was singled out for particularly strong criticism,commission President Jacques Santer said the body chose "by unanimity to resigncollectively."                           Le Soir of Belgium supported thedramatic gesture of unity since "it is too late for half-measures or for soft,evasive answers" and claimed the resignations were needed because thecommission "suffers from a democracy deficit and therefore a lack oflegitimacy. ... To counterbalance this [it] has to be perfect, spotless." Incontrast, the Euro-skeptic Times of London speculated that the collective action might,in fact, represent a further avoidance of individual responsibility, andworried about the possible "renomination" of the entire commission (an ideafloated by Santer Tuesday): "This supposedly cathartic drama could end up as a'Japanese' purge, in which heads roll only to ensure that things continue muchas before, with much the same discredited cast. That would be an outrage."            France's Le Monde                saw a silver lining in the crisis andsaid the institution had to seize this opportunity to"clean up its administrative and financial habits, improve its decision-makingprocess and, most of all, rediscover the inspiration and drive it has lost.This might even mean increasing its funding and staffing levels." TheGuardian ofLondon pointed out that the commission's problems were partly caused bythe expansion of its responsibilities as it "found itself taking on ever moregrandiose tasks, largely on the demand of member states, with progressivelymore limited resources. Yesterday's report shows they did not know how tocope."            Meanwhile, there is noresolution in sight. Germany and Britain want to replace Santer as soon aspossible, while seven other countries would prefer him to remain as a"caretaker" until Dec. 31, 1999--the end of his term. Britain's Independent made itsposition clear in an editorial Wednesday: "It is time to clear out the Eurotrash."            In Ecuador, Monday's reopening of the banks, after a weekof government-ordered closure, put the population in the streets, as depositorsqueued to withdraw their funds and striking taxi drivers and bus operatorsblocked roads to protest a 165 percent increase in the price of gasoline. AsQuito faced its third day of roadblocks Wednesday, Diario Hoy reportedthat the capital was in a state of paralysis with schools closed and provisionsin short supply. ElTelgrafo of Guayaquil blamed the uncertainty gripping the populace on politicians'failure to discuss possible solutions to the crisis. "There has to be anopening and communication on the part of government. If it wants to achieve anational accord, it's logical that it must display an openness toreconciliation."            In Beijing, thestate-run ChinaDaily pooh-poohed U.S. media reports about Chinese nuclear espionage atthe Los Alamos laboratories. In an editorial Wednesday, the paper claimed, "The 'lab-theft' story isbound to follow in the footsteps of the 'political donations' and 'satellitesecret leakage' reports--to be forgotten within a few weeks after the claimscannot be substantiated."            A story in AsahiShimbun of Japan revealed that Aum Shinrikyo, the cult that attackedthe Tokyo subway with Sarin nerve gas in 1995, is enjoying a resurgence basedin part on the financial security provided by a chain of successful computerstores affiliated with the group. The paper claims that the stores' prosperitystems from their cheap prices, which are possible because believers work fornext to nothing. A former member of the group told Asahi Shimbun that"Aum followers work there, and the job is considered part of religioustraining. Their salaries are therefore zero." A "public security investigator"quoted by the paper speculated that Aum will "grow into a stronger and biggerorganization with ironclad solidarity" when Fumihiro Joyu, a senior cultmember, is released from prison in November.
