                                 Diana, You Ignorant Slut            Culturebox's first thought on reading Diana: In Search of Herself , Sally Bedell Smith'sdeliriously mean-spirited (though boringly written) catalog of all the ways thelate fairy-tale princess turns out to have been troubled, trite, andexasperating, is that the British public didn't get its money's worth from thegirl. During her marriage, according to the New York Times , Dianacost her subjects $3,287 a day ($1.2 million a year). Much of that paid forclothing, cosmetics, hair styling, physical and speech training, health care,beauty treatments, fancy vacations, and a private staff--all legitimateexpenses for a state official whose job it is to be a professional celebrity.(Why the British would pay their royals to do such a job is anotherquestion.)            If you go by Smith's account, the rest must have gone to: 1) a surprisinglylarge number of cell-phone calls--up to 20 a day per person--to a surprisinglylarge number of lovers; 2) alternative therapists--astrologists (three),spiritualists (including a clairvoyant who put her in touch with hergrandmother), a tarot card reader, an energy healer, a hypnotherapist, an"anger-release" therapist, colonic irrigationists, osteopaths, chiropractors,reflexologists, aromatherapists, shiatsu and tai chi chuan experts,acupuncturists, and a "mind-body" therapist, the last a former tax accountantwho gave her massages and diet advice; 3) more conventional forms of treatmentfor sleeplessness, eating disorders, paranoia, and self-mutilation, includingan episode in which she slashed her arms and smeared the blood all over thewalls of an airplane; 4) lunch at fancy restaurants to which she secretlyinvited tabloid reporters so she could drop by their tables and leak whatevershe wanted to appear in their publications the next day.            When you think about it, Item 4 probably is in the job descriptionfor an official celebrity, which brings us to Culturebox's second reaction tothis book: that the British got everything they paid for and more. Smith'sDiana was an ill-educated, impulsive woman who spent her adult life reelingfrom what Smith dubiously diagnoses as a borderline personality disorder.(Culturebox knows as little about psychiatry as Smith does, but she knows wildanalysis when she sees it.) Whatever the cause, Diana was depressed, secretive,paranoid, dissembling, self-loathing, desperately needy, and unable to sustainclose relationships.            Yet she was also the century's most popular royal personage, a fact that nowseems not at all unrelated. When you know how unstable Diana was, you graspthat it was her lack of self-control that fueled the media's obsession. She gotour attention because she was cute, but she held it because she gave thepaparazzi so much to work with--all those unchecked expressions of slyness orshyness or vulnerability or boredom, all that Sturm und Drang aboutneeding her privacy. Tabloid editors put her on the cover day in and day outbecause eating disorders and fainting fits made good copy, not out of sympathywith her charities. And since by the ironclad laws of yellow journalism thefamous have to be famous for something, Diana became the universal symbol ofindividual suffering, the victim of unfeeling institutions everywhere. Othersmight have found the attention devastating, but Diana must have been relievedto find in the public eye the unflagging concern, pity, and sense of dramaSmith says the princess demanded, and failed to get, from Charles. Diana onlyever had one loyal suitor--the public--and she quickly figured out how to winits favor, cultivating tabloid reporters while complaining about theirimpertinences, figuring out more often than not what to wear and say and how toupstage the other royals.            It was strangely easy for her to outfox the palace. No rational being, noone concerned about shoring up a marriage or maintaining a position in society,could have predicted what move Diana would make next. She leaked stories thatput her in a questionable light. She collaborated with a tabloid reporter,Andrew Morton, on a royals-bashing biography that made divorce Charles' onlyoption. She defied everyone she knew, including her own press secretary, to goon television for a notorious 1995 interview in which she came off as wildlyself-pitying and un-self-aware. She flaunted her relationship with Dodi, theno-good son of a corrupt and authoritarian father. But Diana never cared muchabout being a princess. She cared about being a celebrity, and her publicresponded to her devotion by canonizing her: Saint Diana of Bathos. You'd haveto be mad to court such a fate, but luckily, she was.
