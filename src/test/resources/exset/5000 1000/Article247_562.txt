                                 Bank Shots            The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with Monday's big merger announcements, and everybody haslots of front-page and inside banking stories. The New York Times ,which led with the mergers yesterday, goes with the looming high costs of themidterm elections. USA Today goes with the mysterious breakdown experienced byAT&T's "frame relay" data network, which is used by hundreds ofmultinational companies to handle such tasks as central database access ande-mail. The main effects the paper mentions are a reservations slowdown atNorthwest Airlines and travel agencies' difficulties getting credit cardauthorizations.            The WP lead reports that the company emerging from theBankAmerica/NationsBank combine will command eight percent of all bank depositsin the U.S., close to the ten percent limit currently mandated by federal law.The Post notes however, that unlike last week's Citicorp/Travelers move,which challenges Depression-era laws barring different types of financialservices from being offered by a single company, this bank merger is within theboundaries of current law, because in 1994, Congress allowed coast-to-coastbanking. But, mentions the Wall Street Journal , Sen. Arlen Specter is contemplatinglegislation that would raise the hurdles to Fed approval of big bankmergers.            The WP reports that many bank stocks soared on the merger news, whilethe LAT identified more with customers and employees than shareholders,going high in its story with concerns that the BankAmerica/NationsBank dealwould lead to higher fees and could eliminate 8,000 jobs. The NYTdoesn't get to that latter bit of unpleasantness until the fifteenth paragraphof its bank story.            The WP breaks out a separate story about what the deal means to customers, dominated by wiggle-claimsquoted from others like "bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to theaccounts of individual customers" and "bigger banks do tend to charge higherfees." But USAT 's news section cover story on bank mergers says itflat-out: "surveys show that big banks charge higher fees," and backs thatassertion up with several data bullets.            A NYT op-ed makes the point that in light of these big bankmergers, the government should reconsider the consequences if one of the newmonsters fails. Current law allows the government to completely protectdepositors and creditors of banks considered too big to let fail. This policyignores the lesson of the S and L crisis in the 1980s and of the current Asianimbroglio: the promise of complete protection contributes to bank failures byencouraging risky bank ventures. So, the piece argues, big account holdersshould have to personally bear some of the loss that comes from a failure. Thatwould encourage them to monitor their banks more closely.            The NYT lead says that the upcoming midterm elections are aptto break spending records because candidates are buying television time farearlier than ever before. The trend is being attributed to Bill Clinton's 1995decision to mount an early and intense television campaign. Another influencethe paper cites is that of Steve Forbes, who became a major force in earlyRepublican primaries by spending tons of his own money on TV ads. It's becomeobvious that politicians fear not having the campaign money far more than theyfear any scandal caused by raising it. The paper notes that Alfred Checchi, acandidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of California, beganbuying television ads just before last Thanksgiving for the primary vote thiscoming June. Checchi's standard, says the Times , promises to lead to themost expensive state election in history.            The WSJ "Work Week" column notes a simple position taken by theNational Association of Manufacturers that could encourage high school studentsto take their classes more seriously: use high-school transcripts more inhiring.            The WP business section reports that a company that until now hassold its language-understanding software to the intelligence community forspy-detection is poised to sell a similar product designed to help thegovernment and brokerage firms monitor the offers and promises made by brokersin communications with (potential) clients. The idea is that the program thatonce could pick out the needle of a phrase like "covert operative" in ahaystack of e-mails has now been trained, says the paper, to do the same for"opportunity of a lifetime" and "so safe even my mother has it." Forgive"Today's Papers" for wondering--but how will this software catch brokers if itcouldn't catch Aldrich Ames?
