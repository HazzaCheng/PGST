                                 Mississippi Learning                           USAToday leads with President Clinton's criticism Tuesday of healthinsurers for making it too difficult for people who switch or lose their jobsto get coverage. The Washington Post leads with oil prices hitting a ten-yearlow. The New York Timesgoes with the Senate Republicans' proposed budget and its rejection ofClinton's domestic spending priorities. The Los AngelesTimes lead is that California thrift institution Home Savings is beingbought by Seattle-based Washington Mutual, creating the nation'sseventh-largest financial institution. But the paper's off-lead is probably thebigger story: The earthquake hazard facing Southern California may only be halfas great as scientists had been saying, and it's very unlikely that the regionwill ever experience that staple of Los Angeles small talk, the 8.0 quake, akaThe Big One.                           USAT reports that Clinton has asked HHS Secretary Donna Shalala tolook into strengthening a 1996 law aimed at helping people between jobs keeptheir health coverage. The main problem, says the paper, is that the lawdoesn't control how much companies can charge for such gap coverage, so theyare tending to make it prohibitive.            Following up on the USAT lead from just over a week ago, theWP lead reports that oil prices have gone down into the $13 a barrelneighborhood, a true boon to the U.S. economy. Adjusted for inflation, this isthe lowest price since the energy crisis in the 1970s. The reasons given arethe same ones offered in the papers last week: a mild winter here and inEurope, a slowdown in Asian demand and the unwillingness by two of OPEC'sbiggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, to cut production. A bit furtherbelow in the story is the reason for that: they are trying to gain market sharevia low prices.            The Senate Budget Committee proposed a Republican fiscal blueprint that,says the NYT , rejects nearly all of President Clinton's calls forincreased spending in such areas as education, child care and health care,choosing instead to put the proceeds of any tobacco settlement into Medicare.But on the other hand, the budget plan provides smaller tax cuts than weresought by many Republicans, and supports the Clinton administration's plan touse budget surpluses to first shore up Social Security. The Times saysthe proposal is likely to be adopted more or less intact.            The Wall Street Journal runs a piece inside reporting that itturns out the Beardstown Ladies, the group of elderly investors whobecame media darlings a few years back, have been overstating the annualizedrate of return they're achieving. Turns out that between 1983 and 1993 it was9.1 percent, not 23.4 percent, the figure on the cover of their best-sellinginvestment guidebook. During the same period, the DJIA was up 12.1 percent.Oops, math error, say the Ladies. (The audit was prompted by earlier stories inChicago magazine and the WSJ .) The oops is also on today'sWP and LAT front pages.            The NYT front reports on the court-ordered release yesterday of morethan 124,000 pages of previously secret files from a Mississippi state agency that used spytactics, intimidation, false imprisonment, jury tampering and other illegalmethods to fight civil rights activities in the state. The files are believedto provide material for lawsuits against the state and also for the reopeningof long-dormant cases of crimes against civil rights workers, along the linesof the long-delayed but finally successful prosecution of the man who murderedMedgar Evers. The Mississippi papers story is also carried inside theWP .            This week's Bill-Bashing from Michael Kelly in his Post columnincludes the following table of organization for the Clinton White House:There's "Robert Bennett, the president's sexual misconduct mouthpiece, which isa distinguished position. It is distinguished from David Kendall, hispersonal-finance corruption mouthpiece; from Lanny Davis, his campaign-financecorruption mouthpiece; from James Kennedy, his White House general scandalmouthpiece; from James Carville, his 'independent' general scandal mouthpiece;and from Michael McCurry, his don't ask, don't tell mouthpiece."
