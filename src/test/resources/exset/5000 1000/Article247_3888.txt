                                 Banana Belches on the Brooklyn Bridge                        Dear Seth,            My quads are doing quite well, thanks. And that's a very good question youraise about whether or not these bars are any better than regular food, becausefrom the outside, they look like treats. The crackly foil wrappers, thetempting names like Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch and Wild Berry. Thisdeceptively yummy packaging makes what you find inside even more disappointing.In general they are extrusions of jaw-tiringly chewy, chemical-smellingwaxiness. Likewise with sports drinks. Their names (Arctic Shatter, Frost)promise limitless refreshment. But when you drink them, your first thought is"Who put too much water in the Kool-Aid?"            So why eat this stuff? Are sports bars and drinks an improvement on abalanced diet and plain old water? Or are they just another piece of gear, likean expensive running watch that looks cool but won't get you to the finish lineany faster. According to a dietician I spoke with, the garden variety athletehas no need for either sports bars or drinks. The bars are, in general"glorified candy bars," and if you read the label, they often listhigh-fructose corn syrup as their first ingredient. A few bars don't. Shesingled out the Clif Bar as having a good balance of protein, carbohydrates,and fats, as well as high fiber. She also said one thing to look for was a40-30-30 ratio of carbs to fats to proteins. Eating nutrients in this ratio issupposed to keep your blood-sugar levels in check--if you load up on sugars andcarbs with no protein and fat, your blood-sugar levels spike and then drop,leaving you feeling tired.            What about the drinks? There are a few reasons why sports drinks aresupposedly better than water: 1) The presence of carbs--about 6 to 8percent--supposedly speeds your absorption of fluids. 2) The carbs will helpyou stay energized while you work out. 3) They taste good so you drink morethan you would plain water. On the first point, if you keep sucking down thewater before and during your workout, the speed of the absorption shouldn'tmatter. The second point may well be valid, but the question is, would it be anoticeable difference? (We'll see after tonight's run.) And on the third point,I say, tastes good? Depends on whom you're talking to. But in general thedrinks do have an edge up on plain water.            One long-distance runner I spoke with said he relied on sports bars forrefueling during long runs, and that the taste and texture become irrelevantwhen you are incredibly hungry and tired. This touches on two important points.First of all, this type of food is not meant for someone who jogs a few milesor goes to an aerobics class a few times a week. The bars are high in calories,with the Experimental and Applied Science Myoplex Plus Deluxe PrecisionNutrition Bar chocolate flavor topping the list at 340 calories and 7 grams offat--not that far from a Snickers bar. A competitive athlete needs this kind offat and calories, but most people get more than enough in the rest of theirdiet. What this boils down to is if you're training for a marathon or workingout twice a day you may benefit from the bars and drinks. But for your averagejogger, they're pointless.            As for the merits of individual bars we tried before our run, they rangedfrom almost good (Powerbar's Harvest was like a bad granola bar, which for asports bar is excellent) to the truly horrible. I completely agree with yourassessment of the Ironman Nutrition Bar in Cookies 'N Crme. Here I quote frommy notes, expletives deleted: "Taste 0. Texture 0 [out of a possible 5].Disgusting. Vile. Powdery. Chalky. Distinct non-chocolate chemical smell. Gagreflex hit." I did not spit it out, though. Which may explain the intensenausea I felt on the first leg of our run last night. Although we ate them asdirected (30 minutes before exercising), they churned in my stomach withdisturbing violence. It wasn't until I released two massive belches (eachsmelling strongly of false banana) that I was able to settle into the run andfeel halfway normal. And I trace that false banana to the Nature's PlusSpiru-tein High Protein Energy Meal Banana Yogurt Coated Bar, which, althoughit ranked decently in terms of taste and texture going down, was no treatduring the run.            Tomorrow, let's get into the specifics of which drinks and bars are the bestand worst.            Yours,Eliza
