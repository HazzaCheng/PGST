                                 No. 140:            By RandyCohen                           Accordingto Houston psychiatrist Dr. David Krueger, "Part of the reason so many womentake these types of drugs is that men tend to have trouble admitting they havea problem." What types of drugs?                        by noon ETThursday to e-mail your answer to newsquiz@slate.com.                           Responsesto Tuesday's question (No. 139)--"Notions":                                       Toys, comic books, nailpolish, and jewelry. What's the connection?

From their offices,anyway."--Steve Bodow ( David Rakoff and Dan Ricci hadsimilar answers.)

Randy'sWrap-Up                        It is, ofcourse, the juxtaposition of childish amusements and adult ornamentation thatmakes this list so pleasingly perverse. Similarly, it is the odd juxtapositionof references that makes "News Quiz" responses so perversely pleasing: (clickfor more, and you really should because there's terrific stuff on Page 2) SusanSontag and Michael Jackson's ass, glue sniffing and the ruble, IPOs and AdamSandler, MacGyver and 1998. It's the kind of high-low juxtaposition--ofreference, of language, of moral importance--that Woody Allen executes sowonderfully, such as in this excerpt from "The Scrolls": "Whosoever shall notfall by the sword or by famine shall fall by pestilence, so why bothershaving?" Now, sadly, his personal life is itself reduced to a comicjuxtaposition. And if you enjoy that sort of thing, here's a littlejuxtaposition game you can play when you spot odd pairings of the bald and thebeautiful; it's a betting game called "Date or Daughter?" Enjoy.                           ParochialAnswer                        As Daniel Radosh and othersknew, students may not bring any of these items to Al Iman School in Queens,one of 24 Islamic schools in New Jersey, Long Island, and New York City.            In New York state, 480,000students--one in five--attend one of 2,400 registered parochial schools, whichare mostly Catholic or Jewish. Nationwide, about one in 10 of the 50 millionschoolchildren attend religious schools, of which more than 200 areIslamic.            On Monday, the U.S. SupremeCourt let stand a ruling permitting taxpayer-financed vouchers to send kids toMilwaukee parochial schools.            The courtalso let stand a ruling giving royalty rights to the Kingsmen for their 1963hit recording of "Louie, Louie." But don't try singing it in the halls of AlIman.
