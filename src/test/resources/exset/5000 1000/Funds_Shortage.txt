Chicago Daily Law BulletinCoping With Funds Shortage is Topic for Legal Aid MeetingDaniel C. VockJuly 25, 2002SPRINGFIELD -- About 225 attorneys and paralegals from acrossIllinois who provide legal services to the poor will gather inChicago early next week for the first time in 13 years to swapideas and offer each other encouragement.But they're also in for some bad news.John N. Erlenborn, president of the Legal Services Corp., theentity that doles out federal money for legal aid, will announce atthe conference that Illinois will suffer "seven-figure fundingcuts" next year because of newly released census figures.Under federal law, money for legal aid is distributed to thestates based on the number of indigent residents.Erlenborn, a former member of the U.S. House of Representativesfrom the Chicago area, did not disclose how big the state's hitwould be but issued a statement Thursday pointing out that onlyfour states would lose more federal money than Illinois in2003.Last year, the LSC gave Illinois nearly $12 million -- or athird of the money going to the state's legal aid programs -- tofund the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago,Prairie State Legal Services and Land of Lincoln Legal AssistanceFoundation. Legal aid providers in the state are already scroungingfor funding as interest rates fall through the floor, because oneof their primary sources of support comes from the interestgenerated on client assets held in trust by lawyers inIllinois.Illinois Supreme Court Justice Thomas L. Kilbride will deliverthe keynote speech to the legal aid providers on Monday and willdiscuss the high court's plan to hike attorney registration fees by$42 to cover the shortfall in the interest income.The high court floated a plan during the spring legislativesession to raise those fees, which would bring in roughly $2.4million and raise the base fee for active attorneys from $180 to$222.That proposal languished, but many observers noted that the highcourt could raise the fees without legislative approval.Organizers of the conference acknowledged that much of thediscussion at the event will center on how to use resources mosteffectively on a shoestring budget.In fact, all of the hotel rooms and conference facilities weredonated to the group after another organization announced at theend of June that it was calling off its convention, leaving thefacilities open, said Linda Zazove, deputy director of Land ofLincoln and a member of the conference's planning committee.A core group of legal aid attorneys hatched the idea of aconference after visiting with representatives of similar programsin other states who regularly hold such meetings, she said.Originally, the organizers hoped for a fall convention but theysprang at the opportunity when the rooms opened up."This is a unique opportunity for people who are in the trenchesdelivering services to get together, meet each other and shareideas," Zazove said.The providers will attend sessions on car-related consumer law,bankruptcy, immigration, welfare, assisting pro se clients,recruiting private attorneys and Internet resources for bothadvocates and clients.Ruth Ann Schmitt, executive director of the Lawyers Trust Fund,which is covering some of the costs of the gathering, acknowledgedthat the legal aid community faces many problems but said themeeting could give attorneys a morale boost."It's not often that the rank and file get together to talkabout their problems.... It's usually the leadership," shesaid.This year's gathering is limited to lawyers and paralegalsworking for legal aid organizations. According to the Lawyers TrustFund, which distributes the interest income, there are about 250Illinois lawyers working full time in the state's 20 programsreceiving LTF funds. Another 100 attorneys work part time for thoseprograms.The organizers hope to expand the event in the future to includejudges and private attorneys and cover more topics in an Access toJustice Conference, Zazove said.
