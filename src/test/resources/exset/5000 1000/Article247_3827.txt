                                 Sleeping Your Way to the White House            Dear Ted:            Looks like it's time to clear the dishes from this old breakfast table. I'llendure the scurrying roaches long enough to say It's been a lot of fun(although I don't usually have elephant dung with my oatmeal).            I should have known I'd get myself in trouble by calling names of myfavorite editorial illustrators. I left out Burt Silverman, Joe Ciardiello,Alan Cober, and Julian Allen (the last two, alas, having passed last year). AndRalph Steadman, the King of Swing.            About drawing ability, don't sweat it, Ted. Your work is so much betterdrawn than Lurie's that the subject shouldn't even be on the table. Youhave what all great artists of all disciplines need: self-knowledge. It is theunderstanding of our own artistic personalities, temperaments, and, yes,limitations that enables us to shape an effective statement on the page. Whilea burnt-out hack like Lurie sweats bullets trying to be Levine (and failingevery single solitary day of his long and lucrative life), excellentcartoonists figure out how to draw in a way that perfectly supports thestatement they're making. You mention Thurber. How sublime he is! Thosedrawings bring you right in. Somehow (and I don't know how) they cause you tostop flipping and really look , and then, of course, you're reading thestory. The Tom Tomorrow thing is interesting. He'd be out on his keisterwithout a Xerox machine. But who cares? The image matches the voicewonderfully. And the voice is saying important things. Your work understandshow fast we're flipping through the newspaper. It brings us immediately to theidea. Your understanding of blacks is very keen; those lines hold the image andgrab our attention. So your cranky left-of-irony point of view comes in loudand clear. For God's sake, don't learn to draw.            For years I resisted The                Simpsons . I hated the drawings. Itseemed a cheap approach to animation. Plus it was on the Fox Network, so, Ithought, how could this be worth the trouble to sit and watch it (TV is a bigeffort for me). Turns out, of course, it's, perhaps TV's greatest moment. Allthe crappy drawing and "family situation comedy" is a ruse. It gets the massesin the tent and then Groening lets them have it. It's powerful, experimental,strangely committed. On top of that, there's very real and touching characterdevelopment. It is a work of unalloyed genius. More than the work of myfavorite graphic artists, this program will be the thing our cultural era willbe remembered for because he wrapped his message in such strategic clevernessas to make it a Saturn rocket that blasts into every home in the USA. And theguy can't draw to save himself.            I'll finish with Phil Harris (I know you've been waiting). Phil Harris wasJack Benny's orchestra leader on radio. He was also married to Alice Faye, thegorgeous star of many 20 th Century Fox musicals. Benny, in aninterview, said that the writers always wrote Harris' radio character as ifhe'd just got out of bed having had great sex. Harris, on radio, is laid-back,flippant, casual, with a little buzz on. You could just see the cigarette.Everyone knows a guy like this; someone so comfortable with himself that hejust doesn't give a f**k. And this, it occurs to me, is why Al Gore is a loser.George W. Bush, you just know has great sex. He said to me last year, "MaybeI'll see you in national politics; maybe I won't I have a cool life." BillBradley? C'mon, great sex. He's a jock, could get all the girls he wanted. He'straveled everywhere, knows about life. Every movement is easy. He's comfortablewith himself. Al Gore looks like a guy who broke his toe because the vibratorfell out of the medicine cabinet when he opened it looking for a band-aidbecause he cut his finger trying to undo his wife's bra. People don't thinkthese things, of course. But I think they perceive them subconsciously. If aman is comfortable with himself, he'll be comfortable in the job. It's too bad,though. Stevenson might have made an inspired president. Or Mondale. OrDukakis. Or Gore.            But I don't think we'll get to find out.            Au revoir,Steve
