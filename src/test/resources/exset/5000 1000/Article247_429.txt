                                 Pulp Fictions            The Washington Post leads with another Iranian challenge toU.S. economic sanctions--negotiations on a $2.5 billion deal with theBritish-Dutch conglomerate Shell hard on the heels of its recently consummated$2 billion offshore gas deal with a French company. The New York Timesgoes with an apparently surprising crime statistic. And the Los AngelesTimes leads with President Clinton's call for Hollywood to avoid makingdrugs look cool.            The NYT reports that, according to FBI data, property crime hasfallen sharply in this country since 1980. Indeed, burglary rates are down byalmost half. New York, the paper reports, now has a lower burglary rate thanLondon. San Diego is, fortunately for Times roving crime reporter FoxButterfield, a city with one of the most precipitous drops in burglary,larceny, and auto theft, so he could rove there instead of Duluth to find outwhat's going on. Theories bandied about by the various experts he quotesinclude: improved police tactics, a decline in the teen-age population, longerprison sentences and greater community involvement with law enforcement.Perhaps the most plausible explanation offered is this: American criminalsincreasingly tend to commit violent crimes rather than non-violent ones. Forexample, London and New York have nearly the same population, with Londonhaving 66 percent more thefts and 57 percent more burglaries but only one-fifthas many robberies and only one-tenth as many murders. In other words, maybe theheadline to this article shouldn't have been "Property Crimes Steadily Decline,Led by Burglary," but rather, "American Criminals Becoming More Violent." Andthen the question is, "Why does a newspaper pick the one over the other?"            In his Saturday radio address, says the LAT in its lead, PresidentClinton urged the entertainment industry to "do its part" by avoiding thedepiction of "warped images" that promote drug use. Addressing the movie andmusic video industry, Clinton is quoted as saying, "Never glorify drugs, butmore importantly, tell our children the truth. Show them that drug use isreally a death sentence." The "Industry" will no doubt raise all the usualFirst Amendment points in response, but more to the point, is Clinton'schallenge really relevant to current movies, as opposed to those made 25 yearsago? In most films nowadays, drug use is practically a convention for showingthat a character is seedy or at least going to seed. Things aren't looking upfor Henry Hill in "Goodfellas" when he starts using coke and we know it. Andwhat was attractive about Uma Thurman's habit in "Pulp Fiction"? It'sinteresting that the president, who knows movies quite well, doesn't give anyactual examples of what he's decrying.            Both the NYT and WP have run stories recently about theimpugning of a collection of alleged JFK private papers that were being usedfor an ABC documentary and a Seymour Hersh book. Today's NYT developsthe story further, breaking the news that about 140 investors, had, before thecontroversy arose, bought dozens of these documents, forking over a total ofperhaps as much as $5 million. The Times says the investors includesports figures and a network news anchor (could that be Peter Jennings,would-be host of the now-in-doubt ABC documentary?), and says that althoughsome experts have discredited the papers, others continue to insist on theirauthenticity--despite the discovery of such anachronisms as mention of a ZIPcode and evidence of lift-off correcting tape.            The WP today starts an occasional series about genetics with a finefirst installment on the controversies surrounding cosmetic gene therapy.According to the piece, many sorts of this type of therapy--for say, gettingtaller, thinner, stronger, tanner or unbald--could be practicable within just afew years, yet no regulations govern them, and the NIH and FDA only recentlydiscussed them for the first time. The piece raises doubts about the basicdistinction of "cosmetic" vs. "medical" here: Why isn't a genetically-inducedpermanent tan just a form of melanoma protection?
