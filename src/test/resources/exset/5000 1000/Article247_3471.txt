                                 Two Cheers for Cond Nast's Acquisition                        Normally, when one of three big players in an industry buys one of its twocompetitors, you hear rumblings about possible antitrust violations and thedeleterious effects of lack of competition. But we've yet to hear any suchrumblings--except perhaps from advertisers--about Cond Nast's $650 millionacquisition of Fairchild Publications, even though Cond Nast will now ownevery key fashion magazine in America, with the exceptions of Harper'sBazaar and Elle . And that's as it should be. If anything, increasingCond Nast's hold on the fashion press may have beneficial spillover effectsthat no one is really anticipating.            To begin with, even though after the deal closes, Cond Nast will ownWd and Women's Wear Daily , in addition to Vogue andGlamour and assorted other fashion-y magazines, it won't have a monopolyposition. And as the example of the auto industry suggests, having two or threemajor players in an industry is qualitatively different from having just one.As long as Harper's Bazaar and Elle remain outside the fold,Cond Nast will be limited in its ability to do whatever bad things monopolistsgenerally do.            Actually, that's the other thing. It's hard to figure out what the badthings Cond Nast might do are, and it's just as hard to figure out who is hurtby this deal (hard to figure out who's being hurt that we don't want to behurt, that is). The pricing of magazines is difficult to decipher (it often, infact, seems irrational), but it's unlikely that W's cover price is goingto rise just because it's owned by the same company that owns Vogue . Andthis is despite magazine consumers' tendency to be somewhat price-insensitive,which accounts for the fact that so many magazines are sold at the newsstand,even though the price of one copy there is often equal to the price of four orfive copies bought by subscription. So, consumers won't be hurt in thepocketbook.            As for editorial, it's possible that the Cond Nast mentality--whatever thatis--will come to rule the Fairchild magazines, but if a year from now you'reable to tell the difference between the pre- and post-Cond Nast W's,God bless you. That doesn't mean, of course, that it won't be a new experiencefor the editors of W and Jane to work with James Truman and SiNewhouse, but editors don't count as a valid constituency to protest antitrustviolations.            The one group that probably will be hurt by the deal is the advertisers, butthis is a good thing. In a business sense, the deal may make all these CondNast magazines less beholden to any single advertiser, which in turn will allowthe company to drive harder bargains. The flip side of this is that it willmake advertisers think harder about why they advertise and where theyadvertise. In other words, the acquisition may have the unforeseen effect ofmaking the whole industry more businesslike.            More important, this deal may make it easier for magazines--of all sorts--totake more critical looks at the companies and personalities in the fashionindustry. It's an open secret in magazine publishing that there are somestories that just can't be done, because running them would result inadvertising's being pulled that magazines can't afford to be pulled. But nowCond Nast will be in the position of saying to displeased subjects of toughpieces: "You want to pull your advertising? Fine. If you think you can make itwithout W , Women's Wear Daily , Vogue , Glamour ,etc., etc., more power to you." Shifting the balance of power away fromadvertisers is, in that sense, entirely a good thing. So, to take a purelyhypothetical example, perhaps we might actually see a serious piece on what RonPerelman, head of Revlon, has done to many of the companies (MarvelEntertainment, Coleman, Consolidated Cigar, Revlon itself) he's been in chargeof. OK, probably not. But isn't it pretty to think so?
