                                 Airstrike Hits Northwest            Local stories lead at the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times , but the papers' top internationalstories are about Russia. The New YorkTimes also leads with Russia--more analysis of President Clinton'supcoming trip to Moscow. Expectations for the Clinton-Yeltsin summit are nothigh, given the weakened status of both presidents. In paragraph two, theNYT draws a portentous parallel between the teetering Clinton andRichard Nixon, who met with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in 1974 in Moscow.Five weeks after returning to Washington, Nixon resigned.            The LAT top international story reports that Russian acting primeminister Viktor Chernomyrdin's voiced assurances on Saturday that Russia willpursue market reforms and democracy. The NYT and WP coverChernomyrdin's remarks inside; the WP adds that his statement, "therewill be no return to the past," may have been intended to mollify theInternational Monetary Fund, which is scheduled to give Russia a $4.3 billionloan installment in September. However, a WP front-page articleheadlined "Russia in Reverse" effectively belies Chernomyrdin's assertions,saying, "Perhaps more than at any time [since] the Soviet collapse, theconcepts of liberal market reform and democracy are in retreat."            Also in the front-page Russia roundup: a LAT article profiles adecidedly "undemocratic" figure in Russian politics, billionaire BorisBerezovsky, who is believed to have been instrumental in Chernomyrdin'sreappointment. The NYT runs a colorful piece on Russians' survivalstrategies during the currency crisis.            The papers continue coverage of the pilots' strike at Northwest Airlines,which began at midnight Friday night. All Northwest flights are grounded atleast until midweek. President Clinton has decided not to intervene for themoment.            A WP front-page article says that criticism of Secretary of StateMadeleine Albright is mounting. The reason: her tough talk has produced fewresults, especially in a time of multiple international crises. However, thearticle also quotes analysts who say that President Clinton, scandal-dogged andan inchworm on foreign affairs, may muffle Albright's activism.            The WP "Outlook" lands a double-strike against the U.S. cruisemissile attacks. One article decries "vigilante justice," and says that theUnited States erred by declaring itself in effect "free to make its own rules"against an amorphous terrorist network. Another piece questions the wisdom ofthe U.S. military strategy. It argues that while cruise missile strikes may becheap in terms of American lives (and thus are politically safe), the waragainst terrorism requires a "long-term and unwavering commitment." This meansa concentrated campaign using ground troops and special forces as well ascruise missiles. The NYT "Week In Review," meanwhile, shudders at theworldwide malaise of weak leadership.            Good news for the art world: An inside NYT article cheers thecountry-music-loving leader of National Endowment for the Arts, who has managedto twang on Congressional artstrings though he has only been in the job twomonths. In his optimistic view, "the federal role in the arts should be equalto our role in the Department of Defense."            A lengthy but transfixing WP "Style" article peers into the chambersof the Church of Satan, a San Francisco-based group whose roster of twistedrituals includes "satanic baptisms" and the use of nude women as altars. Thechurch's charismatic and controversial founder recently died (presumably, wentto hell), which may catalyze the institution's demise. But devoted followers(who can occasionally be found jamming at the Lucifer's Hammer death-rockscene) vow to carry the satanic torch high.            A NYT front-page piece reports that surfing the Internet causesincreased depression. A two-year study found that one Internet hour per weekmade participants one percent more depressed. In addition, their circle offriends shrank by an average of 2.7 people. Yikes! Working 35+ hours a week, TPis on course to wind up at least 35 percent more depressed and lose over 94.5friends.
