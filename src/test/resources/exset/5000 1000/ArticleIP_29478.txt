Randy's LargeIntestine Wrap-Up                        Although many of you submitted enema jokes, I rannone--an aesthetic not a political decision, if such a distinction is possible.Some laugh at colonic humor, some don't. I have no doubt that several entrieswere particularly fine examples of rectal comedy. These I have passed along tomy London counterpart, Sophie Rhys-Cohen, who plans to run them in "NaughtyScamp," the English edition of News Quiz, along with many comical pictures ofmen in women's clothing and a terrific photograph of Queen Elizabeth's leftbreast. (At least they said it was hers when Sophie R-C handed over 100,000 ofBill Gates' money.)            Incidentally, NaughtyScamp is still encouraging participants to suggest better things to do withfresh fruits and vegetables than eat them.                           Five Americans, aCanadian, and a Russian Walk Into an Answer                        All are packed in the cargo bay of the SpaceShuttle Columbia for a scheduled Thursday launch.            And if it does take place, that launch will end astring of six consecutive failures. The unmanned six-failure record was brokenTuesday by the Thaad anti-missile system, when the rocket that was to serve asits target, in the words of Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon,"tumbled chaotically out of control." I guess we've all done that. The Thaadproject, incidentally, has already cost more than $3 billion. Neither Congressnor the Defense Department is discouraged by its unbroken record of failure. Icall that plucky.            If the Columbia does get off the ground, itscrew of five Americans, a Canadian, and a Russian will transfer those suppliesto the Russian-American space station, in one of the 160 space walks on 86flights needed to complete the station--and no doubt worth every penny.            Canvas? Can that beright--canvas tool bags in outer space? Shouldn't the tools be stowed insomething spectacularly light and strong and expensive--Kevlar or woven Tang orsomething? But that's what Beth Dickey reports in the New York Times ,and that's good enough for me.                           Chris Kelly'sMedical Extra                        I don't know if thiscounts as an "extra" or anything, but what the hell is going on with GeorgeLucas' neck? I mean, you'd think a guy with all that high-tech know-how coulddo something about that sucker. It's less like a wattle and more like a Siamesetwin. Maybe he could computer-animate some paisleys on it and claim it's ascarf. Am I the only person this unsettles? Am I just jealous?
