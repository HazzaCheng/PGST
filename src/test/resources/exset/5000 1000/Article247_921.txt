                                 Too Good To Check            Bruno Doesseker is the real name of a Swiss author known to the world asBinjamin Wilkomirski, a Latvian Jewish concentration camp survivor andmemoirist who is now accused of having wholly fabricated his harrowing tale oftoddlerhood in the camps. When I read about him earlier this week in theNew York Times , I immediately  sided with the guy--whatever his namewas. I hadn't read the book, but I remembered the reviews. Here was an authorhailed by one shaken critic after another for the literary quality of hishorrific prose. His book (his first) had been instantly promoted to the firstranks of the Holocaust canon. What did factuality have to do with artisticmerit?            Before you write me off as a waffling postmodernist, let me remind you thatpublishing fiction as truth is an enduring tradition in world literature,dating back to the early days of the novel, a genre deemed suspect because itinvolved telling lies. One of the greatest novels in any language, RobinsonCrusoe , was published by an author named Robinson Crusoe--not by DanielDefoe--and passed off as a factual tale. The Spanish picaresque tales thatCervantes harvested in Don Quixote were published as autobiography.Mark Twain parodies this custom in the opening paragraph of Huck Finn ,when he has Huck assure the reader that The Adventures of Tom Sawyerwas true, even though written by this other fellow, Mark Twain: "There wasthings which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth."            Before Wilkomirski a.k.a. Doesseker was exposed--his nemesis was anotherHolocaust memoirist, bitter at his lack of comparable  success--he traveledaround the world giving seminars on the memory-recovering techniques that ledto his "discovery" that he was a Holocaust survivor. That wassnake-oil-salesman-ish of him, but still. All those reviewers couldn't bewrong. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this mischievously category-defyingmasterpiece and savor the higher truths that emanated from its pages.            Alas, read as a novel, Binyamin Wilkomirski's Fragments is maudlinand obvious. The device of the child's point-of-view would have had nocredibility if the author hadn't sworn to having had the memories himself.First he apologizes for the book's fragmentary nature; then he proceeds torecount the most neatly sewn-up Holocaust tale I've ever read. Every step istaken in this three-year-old's progress toward ultimate horror. Every detail isin place, although the childish narrator professes not to understand them.There's the death of his father. The story of hiding in a farmhouse where thefarmer's wife is raped by a soldier. On it goes: How the child was separatedfrom his brothers. The motherly guard who took him to the camps. His life inthe barracks. A visit to his mother. How he survived when everyone else died.How he ended up in Switzerland, alone and wildly misunderstood. As fact, it'simplausible: No child who had gone through what he had gone through by the ageof six would have remembered every key element this specifically. As fiction,it's banal: Steven Spielberg couldn't have written a more helpfully linearscreenplay, or given us the eyes of a more heartbreaking innocent to view itthrough..            This raises the question of why so many critics were so moved by so manyclichs. It's not hard to understand, I suppose. Wilkomirski/Doesseker trafficsin the most appalling subset of the most gruesome atrocities known tohumankind--the brutal degradation and casual annihilation of uncomprehendingchildren. We've been primed to pity by other Holocaust classics, many ofwhich-- The Diary of Anne Frank , The Painted Bird ,Night --also involve children, as if only children could give adequatetestimony to the horror of what took place. It is all but impossibleto retain critical equanimity in the face of such things, especially when weknow that what Wilkomirksi/Doesseker tells us, was, in its rougher outlines,true.  Fragments does us the favor of filling in more of thoseoutlines, but with only marginally more artistry than a networknewsmagazine-style "reconstruction." It's too bad. I can't help wishingWilkomirksi/Doesseker had been more subtle in his efforts at deception andproduced the magnificent fraud world literature deserves.                           --Judith Shulevitz
