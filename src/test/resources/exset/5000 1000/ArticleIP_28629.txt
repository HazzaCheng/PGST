                                  Dress To Thrill            Coming to work on the bus the other day, I satacross the aisle from a woman who was probably in her 50s. She was plainlooking and plainly dressed. I guessed her to be a household worker. Her slipwas showing. That is not unusual. What struck me was that the hem of her slipwas lace.            I spontaneously said to myself, "What a pitifulattempt at elegance!" But when I got off the bus and ruminated on it, Irealized that was a condescending and stupid reaction. She was sayingsomething. She was saying; "I'm not just a two-legged vacuum cleaner ordishwasher. I'm a person who deserves to be respected and loved."            That bit of lace made a big difference to her. Itwas the difference between a work uniform and private, personal dress. Wearingthe lace was a decision she had made for herself, beyond the requirements ofher working life. She was expressing her membership in a class of people whohave a life beyond work and who have some bit of "fancy" in their dress to showit.            To whom was she making this statement? To herself,of course. There may have been someone else--a husband or a boyfriend. Butfirst of all she was making it for herself, to make herself feel good.            How do I know this,Watson? I have not interviewed her nor spoken any word to her. But I imaginethat is the way people are. I imagine that people want to think of themselvesas belonging to a group that they admire or respect and dress as they think amember of that group dresses. Their object is not to display theirindividuality, except that they want to choose their group. I don't believethat people in China were happy all wearing the same Mao jackets, because thatdid not express membership in a group that they had chosen. I understand thatunder those Mao jackets there were frequently bits of colorful clothing thatreflected more private choices.            The message of the clothing is first of all to the wearer.I think of those girls in West Side Story singing "I Feel Pretty!" Theydidn't sing "I'm So Pretty." The important thing for them was to feelpretty, and they associated the way they dressed with the feeling of beingpretty.            We see all the youngwomen--and some not-so-young--walking around in the office district in short,black dresses and shoes with built-up, chunky heels. For many of them, that isnot the most becoming outfit they could wear. That depends on how good theirlegs are. And they are surely not expressing individuality. They are expressingtheir membership in a class of women who are smart, professional, liberated,and also feminine and sexy. They are expressing it to themselves and towhomever may be looking.            At the street corner there is a group of young men withexceedingly droopy trousers and black, high shoes. The laces flopping loosely.They are imitating prison dress. In their way--which may be entirely peacefuland law-abiding--they are showing their solidarity with those who thumb theirnoses at the mores of bourgeois society.            What about all those menyou see in gray slacks and navy blue blazers with brass buttons? They areever-young alumni of Eastern colleges--or want to feel they are. They are proudto be "Scarsdale Galahads," "Brooks Brothers types," despite the disdain withwhich those words are used in Guys and Dolls .            Of course, the extreme in men's dress is the dinner jacket.All men--at least, the ones I know--say they hate to have to get into thatmonkey suit. They curse as they struggle with the bow tie. But is there a manwith a soul so dead, or a waist so big, that he does not smile and say, "Bond,James Bond," when he looks at himself in the mirror fully attired?            When I was in the Nixonadministration, we were all very buttoned-down during the week. On Saturdays,however, when only the "responsible" people, the presidential appointees, cameto work in the White House and the Executive Office Building, casual dress wasthe uniform. That was our way of showing, to ourselves especially, that we wereintimates of those eminent locations.            And what about me now? On the days I go to my office, Iwear a flannel shirt with no necktie if the weather is cool. In warm weather, Iwear an open-necked sport shirt with no jacket. Some people have said that Idress "Israeli style," but that isn't really it. I am asserting my membershipin the club of "Old Geezers." We have paid our dues. We are free ofobligations, including the obligation to dress like everyone else. We know thatour dress is only a trivial sign of our liberation, but it is a sign weenjoy.            So, hail to you, my lace-bedecked bus mate! May youalways be elegant to yourself, as you will always be to me.
