                                 Death and Taxes            Last week House Speaker NewtGingrich proposed abolishing the estate tax. Many other Republican politicians,and some Democrats, have done the same.            The estate tax is imposed onassets passed on to heirs when someone dies. It is the only federal tax onwealth --as opposed to income or consumption. Congress imposed it in1916, mainly motivated by Progressive Era concerns about the concentration ofwealth in the coffers of a few families.            Theestate tax is progressive --that is, the tax rate is higher on largerestates. The first $600,000 is exempt. A couple can, therefore, pass on $1.2million tax-free to their heirs. The rate is 37 percent on amounts between$600,000 and $750,000. The highest rate is 55 percent, and kicks in at $3million. But any amount inherited by a spouse is exempt. Pre-death giftsof up to $10,000 a year per recipient are also exempt. Thus, a couple with twochildren can pass on $40,000 a year tax-free. (Lifetime gifts above theexempted amount are subject to the gift tax , which more or lessparallels the estate tax.)                           Creative accounting also reduces theestate-tax burden. Deductions , which include administrative costs andcharitable gifts, are ample. The tax is based on property's "fair marketvalue ," which is a malleable concept and notoriously underestimated byprofessional estate appraisers. Squabbles between the IRS and estates over fairmarket value are routine and often protracted. Trusts and othercomplicated devices are also used to reduce the tax on large estates, althoughCongress has eliminated many of these opportunities and the IRS has beenscrutinizing others more closely in recent years.            The estatetax affects few . Last year, 69,772 estates with assets of more than$600,000 filed forms with the IRS. The combined value of these estates was$117.7 billion. However, because of credits and deductions--mostly transfers tospouses--only 31,918 estates paid the government any money. That's 1.2 percentof all estates. The IRS collected $17.8 billion. According to calculations doneby the group Citizens for Tax Justice, 95 percent of the $17.8 billion camefrom estates valued at more than $1 million. Last year's numbers are similar tothe data from the last several years.            Proponents offer three reasons for thetax : 1) It reduces concentrations of wealth, however slightly. 2) Becauseof the charitable-contribution deduction, it spurs giving. Estates donated $8.2billion to charity in 1992--almost as much as the $10.1 billion they paid tothe government. 3) The tax provides revenue--though this adds up to only 1percent or 2 percent of total federal revenues in a typical year.            Staunchopponents of the estate tax include farmers . Family farmers oftenpossess highly valued land, but little cash. Consequently, they say, inheritorsof farms must sell their farms to pay the tax. However, according to the IRS,only one in 25 farmers leaves a taxable estate. The inheritors of such estatespay very little. In 1992, the median estate tax paid by farmers was $5,000.Much of the value of inherited land is offset by the deduction of debt. Farmersand owners of small businesses also enjoy special exemptions. Forinstance, their heirs may pay off the estate tax over 14 years at very lowinterest--an option not available to others.            Many political conservatives argue that thegovernment taxes an estate's assets several times over--first when the money isearned, then when it is invested, and finally when it's transferred to heirs.They call the estate tax an exercise in class warfare , and argue that itdrains money from private investment. Some left-of-center economists have madesimilar arguments. Former Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair Alan Blinder andformer chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers Joseph Stiglitzargue that: 1) the estate tax fails as a redistributive measure because richpeople have become too good at circumventing it; 2) the considerable effort putinto circumventing the tax wastes economic resources; and 3) the tax encouragesconsumption, instead of savings and investment.            Death is not all bad newstaxwise. The capital-gains tax on inherited property is based onincreases in value only since the property was inherited. Thus, billions ofdollars of profits on stocks, real estate, etc., escape the capital-gains taxevery year when the owner dies. Some have suggested a trade-off: End the estatetax but tax capital gains at death.
