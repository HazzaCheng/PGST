                                 Taking Leave of Their Census            The Washington Post , Los AngelesTimes and New York Timeslead with a federal court's ruling that the Census Bureau cannot usestatistical sampling in the year 2000 census. USA Todayputs that story on its front, but leads with an unnamed U.S. intelligenceofficial's claim that soil from around that Sudanese plant hit last week byU.S. cruise missiles contained traces of a chemical used in the making of VXnerve gas. The Sudan plant story is the off-lead at the WP andNYT . The USAT lead also covers the latest development in the 1988Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland--discussed earlier in the summer as inthe works by the NYT and nailed down in yesterday's LAT --that theU.S. and Britain have just decided to accept an offer once made by MoammarGadhafi to have the two Libyan suspects in the case tried in the Netherlandsunder Scottish law. No word yet on Gadhafi's reaction. The Lockerbie gambit isreported on the inside by the NYT and as part of the LAT 'sfront-pager on the arrest in Egypt of Abu Nidal, the 1980s terrorist mastermindbelieved to have killed more than 500 people.            The Post lead says the court's rejection of census sampling is aserious setback for the Clinton administration, which had championed it, and apowerful victory for House Republicans, who favor attempting an actual headcount instead. The NYT 's sampling editorial says the decision is "asetback for the democratic process." The NYT says the Census Bureau hadsought sampling to avoid the inaccuracies of the head-counting 1990 census,which missed 8.4 million people. The reason sampling has become controversial,all the papers explain, is that it would probably add categories of people whodon't show up so readily in actual head counts. The Post says thecategories are minorities and poor people. The LAT mentions children,minorities, renters, and poor people, especially these categories in ruralareas. The NYT lead doesn't mention poor people (although the paper'seditorial on the subject does). In short, the method is likely to produce moreDemocrats.            The LAT notes that due to its effect on counts related to education,highway and transit funds, the decision could cost California $1 billion infederal monies. The administration will appeal, but in the meantime, observesthe WP and LAT , the Census Bureau must continue to plan for bothkinds of survey.            The USAT lead says the CIA had been studying the Sudanese plant fortwo years. That paper and the NYT and WP all say the tell-talesubstance found in the surrounding soil has no commercial uses and is not aby-product of any processes besides the production of nerve gas. The NYTadds the news that Iraqi scientists were helping with the nerve gas-relatedproduction at the factory that was hit as well as at another one a few milesaway. The second plant was not Tomahawked, says the paper, because it is in aresidential neighborhood. But USAT and the Post also report thatfor the first time, the Clinton administration conceded on Monday that thefactory may have also been manufacturing medicines.            The NYT adds another fascinating revelation about last week'smilitary action: the number-two officer in the Pentagon traveled to Pakistanjust before the strikes so that he could be on-hand to reassure the Pakistanimilitary that the missiles were not an attack by India.            The Wall Street Journal 's "Work Week" column reports that thenotion of "vicarious liability" of a company for behavior by its employees thatit doesn't even know about is spreading well beyond the Supreme Court'sapplication last spring of that concept to sexual harassment. A federal judgein Tennessee recently ruled, says the paper, that Budget Rent-A-Car could beheld vicariously liable for racial harassment happening in a branch,unbeknownst to the home office.            The NYT op-ed page offers sobering assessments of both Bill andHillary. Thomas Friedman says that what people wanted from The Speech anddidn't get was for Bill Clinton to draw a clear line between who he was and whohe intends to be. Until Clinton does that, says the column, his ability togovern is paralyzed no matter what Kenneth Starr does. And, wonders Friedman,"if there is no hope for the agenda, what need is there for the man?" AndPulitzer Prize-winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein offers a sort of "HillaryChronicles" tracking the morphing of the idealistic, forthright Hillary intosomething else--a "loyal wife." Her approval rating, Wasserstein writes, is ata record high, "even as her actual achievements are at a record low."
