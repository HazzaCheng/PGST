                                 My Personal Trade Deficit            To my vast delight, a Barnes& Noble superstore has arrived in Pittsford, N.Y., about a mile from myhome in the neighboring town of Brighton. I shop at Barnes & Noble severaltimes a week--mostly for books, sometimes for music, occasionally for software,and nearly always for coffee.            My trade deficit withPittsford has grown explosively since Barnes & Noble arrived. In otherwords, I spend more money in Pittsford than I did before. A trade deficit isthe amount you spend in a given place minus the amount you earn there. (A tradesurplus is just the opposite: The amount you earn in a given place minus theamount you spend there.) I don't earn any income in Pittsford, so my tradedeficit is equal to the amount I spend.                         I've been thinking about trade deficits because I picked upthe local newspaper this morning and read an op-ed piece about the U.S. tradedeficit with Mexico. It says that, pre-NAFTA, the United States had a tradesurplus with Mexico--the average American earned more in Mexico than hespent there. (Producing goods for sale to Mexicans counts as "earning inMexico"; buying goods made by Mexicans counts as "spending in Mexico.") Todaythe opposite is true: The United States has a trade deficit with Mexico, andit's growing.            Accordingto the op-ed piece, that's proof that the average American was better offwithout NAFTA. But the identical logic "proves" that I was better off withoutBarnes & Noble. Not only is the conclusion false, it's the exact oppositeof the truth. When people take advantage of new opportunities to buy thingsthey want, it usually makes them happier.            The truth is that any change in ourtrade position with respect to Mexico--in either direction--is evidence thatfree trade has been good for Americans. My neighbor got a job at the new Barnes& Noble. His trade surplus with Pittsford grew, just like my owntrade deficit . In both cases, the changes meant that our lives had gotbetter.            The sameanalogy illustrates another point: Although NAFTA-induced changes in theU.S.-Mexican trade deficit are evidence of improvements, the actuallevel of the trade deficit means virtually nothing. If Barnes &Noble had located in the town of Penfield instead of in Pittsford, I'd have ahigher trade deficit with Penfield, a lower trade deficit with Pittsford, andmy life would be about the same as it is now.            Amore interesting number is my overall tradedeficit--the total of all my spending minus the total of all my earning. Myoverall trade deficit was pretty high yesterday: I spent $600 on a living-roomrug, and I earned $0. (It was a Sunday and I didn't feel like working.) Myoverall trade deficit was $600.            Traditionally, businessjournalists describe every increase in the overall trade deficit as a"worsening." According to that tradition, I had a very bad day yesterday. Butit didn't feel like a bad day--I like my new rug, and it wouldhave been inconvenient to put off buying it until a day when I felt likeearning enough to pay for it.            When thenation's overall trade deficit increases, it means that Americans, on average,are spending more than they are earning. Maybe that's because your neighborsare behaving foolishly; maybe it's just because they have the good sense torealize that you can sometimes spend more than you earn--provided you'rewilling to draw down your savings.            In any event, foolishly excessive tradesurpluses are a greater danger than foolishly excessive tradedeficits . That's because excessive trade deficits are self-limiting: Ifyou run a trade deficit every year, bankruptcy will eventually force you tostop. But excessive trade surpluses can go on forever. A perpetual tradesurplus is likely to mean you're either working too hard or consuming toolittle; either way, you're not getting enough enjoyment out of life.            Here's the final thing youshould keep in mind when you read about the nation's overall trade deficit: Thenation is nothing but the sum of individual households. But there are limits tohow much you ought to care about what goes on in other people's households.Even if you are convinced that the average American spends too much, or earnstoo little, or spends too little, or earns too much, it's not entirely clearwhy it's any of your business. As long you have your own household in order,fretting about your neighbor's spending habits is a lot like fretting about thecolor of his living-room rug. Maybe lime green was a big mistake, but it'shis mistake to live with.
