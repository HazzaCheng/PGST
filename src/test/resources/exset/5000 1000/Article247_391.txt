                                 Dial Tomes            After a lot of consensus lately, the majors go their separate ways today.USAToday leads with the defection to the U.S. of the North Koreanambassador to Egypt. The Washington Post goes with some new details about Al Gore'sWhite House phone fund-raising. The New York Timesleads with a Senate bill that would significantly cut into the legal rights andfunds of Indian tribes. And the Los AngelesTimes leads with the governor's proposal for providing health carecoverage for the children of California's working poor.                           USAT reports that the defections of the North Korean ambassador andhis wife and brother were "daring, synchronized" and that the couple's sondisappeared from Cairo a year ago and is believed to be in Canada. TheNYT describes the move as an "intelligence bonanza" for the U.S.,pointing out that the ambassador was familiar with his government's sales ofmissiles and other arms to Egypt, Syria and Iran.            When the WP broke the story earlier this year of Al Gore's WhiteHouse telemarketing, Gore's press conference in response was a salute tolegalese and flop sweat. No wonder, according to today's Post , which,based on documents possessed by Senate investigators, reveals that betweenNovember 1995 and May 1996, Gore spoke to at least 46 people from his WhiteHouse office to solicit individual contributions to the DNC of between $25,000and $100,000. The 46 contributed almost $3.7 million in unregulated "softmoney."            According to the Post , some wrongs have already been set right in thematter: The DNC has agreed to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for $24.20 worth ofcalls that Gore apparently made but which do not appear on his credit cardrecords.            The NYT lead covers a conflict between Washington State's Sen. SladeGorton and Native Americans over two riders Gorton got attached to a federalspending bill (full of provisions favored by the Clinton administration) thatwould strip tribes of their current immunity from most lawsuits and would alsosubject federal aid to tribes to means-testing. The piece says that what'sdriving all this is the perception that tribes are getting rich off casinogambling. "I find nothing in any Indian treaty," the story quotes Gorton assaying, "that says they must be continuously supported by the federaltaxpayers." It also quotes "the only Indian in the Senate" (apparently "NativeAmerican" is not in the Times style book) Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,as saying the bills would only be passed "over my dead body."            The Times also reports that Kenneth Starr has subpoenaed publisherWm. Morrow & Co. for records relating to a book being written by formerClinton intimate Webster Hubbell. Morrow will fight this in court startingtoday. The lawyer representing Morrow describes the breadth of the subpoenathis way: "You might as well connect the modem between Morrow's editor and Mr.Starr's office."            By now the drum beat of welfare reform stories has no doubt made it clearthat the dole is shrinking from Alabama to Wyoming. Well, today's WPpoints out Hawaii isn't part of the trend--there, welfare rolls are up 36percent. The Post says it's because of a stagnant state economy and awelfare system still needing an overhaul. Maybe another reason is that when theweather is perfect and you're five minutes from the beach, you don't feel likeworking.            According to the Wall Street Journal 's "Tax Report," the "Schedule D thatinvestors filed this year had only 23 lines, plus a 13-line worksheet in theinstructions. The new Schedule D probably will have about 56 lines, says an IRSofficial, including a worksheet of more than 30 lines that will be part of theform itself."            Maureen Dowd's column in the Times reports that the good liberalDemocrats at Universal have come up with a way to justify trying to make akilling with the upcoming movie "Primary Colors" while still stayingLincoln-Bedroom-close to the First Couple. The movie, goes the studio line, "iscertainly not based on the Clintons. It's based on the book."
