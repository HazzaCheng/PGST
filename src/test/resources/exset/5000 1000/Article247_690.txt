                                 Dousing the Flames            President Clinton's speech on the global economy leads all around.Lovey-dovey Bill-and-Hillary pix grace the tops at the Los AngelesTimes and Washington Post . A lovey-dovey shot of Homeric rivals Sosaand McGwire does the same at USA Today . At the New York Times ,the spot goes to a shot of a post-speech Clinton at a fund-raiser, amid thecast of "The Lion King."                           USAT , the WP and NYT report that Clinton, in his speechin New York City to the Council on Foreign Relations, called the currentsituation "the biggest financial challenge facing the world in ahalf-century." The LAT says that Clinton spoke of trying to "dousethe flames of the international financial crisis." The Post notes thatthis is a shift from Clinton's much more minimal assessment of the threat lastfall. And indeed, USAT refers to the leading economies' "months ofsilence" about the crisis. The papers note that soon after the speech, thefinance ministers and central bank heads of the G-7 countries issued a jointstatement pledging to spur global growth and restore stability to the financialmarkets.            With characteristic succinctness, USAT does something the othersnever quite do--spell out what the problem is: a third of the world is inrecession, and this threatens the U.S. because overseas trade has accounted for30 percent of U.S. growth since 1993. The remedies Clinton advocated include,the papers report, Congress' replenishment of the IMF, and allowing the IMF totap into an emergency line of credit. All but USAT also mention theresponse of lowering interest rates, to stimulate growth. The NYT saysClinton called for the world's leading economies to abandon their fear ofinflation. The WP says such comments are being widely interpreted ashinting at the need for the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates. Butthe WP , NYT and LAT note that Clinton avoided theappearance of trying to dictate interest rate policy to the Fed.            The Wall Street Journal and WP report that new Russianprime minister Yevgeny Primakov has invited an IMF official to Moscow fortalks. This means, say the papers, that perhaps Primakov will not follow therecent calls from some communists to shut Russia off from western investment.In the immediate balance is a $4.3 billion IMF emergency loan agreed to inJuly, but delayed after Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on itsdomestic debt.            A report highlighted on the front page of last Thursday's WP foundthat children in immigrant families tend to be healthier than those ofU.S.-born parents, but that their health deteriorates the longer they livehere. And today's LAT front bears yet another example of a recent skeinof research questioning the time-honored tenet that immigrating to the U.S. isgood for your health. A new University of California study finds that Mexicanimmigrants have only half as many psychiatric problems as U.S.-born MexicanAmericans do. Fast food, lack of exercise, and especially drug abuse and thebreakdown of the extended family are implicated.            A front-page WP piece and one inside at the NYT report that anew HHS study finds that most of the possible savings to come from the growthof managed care plans in recent years have already been achieved, with theresult that the nation's health care costs are likely to double over thenext decade. Also contributing to the rise, says the study, is an increase inthe consumption of expensive prescription drugs and new medical technology,plus greater patient demand for choosing one's doctor. Already, notes thePost , health insurance rates are starting to go up.            The front page of USAT 's "Money" section reports that as part of itsantitrust case, the DOJ is investigating accusations made by several formerMicrosoft employees that the company destroyed computer files relating tovarious previous lawsuits. The files, says the paper, could have served asantitrust evidence.            The NYT reports inside that a private New Jersey telephone companyhas just signed a deal to build a cellular phone system for the Taliban, theIslamic sect controlling most of Afghanistan. The White House is said by theTimes to have been unaware of the deal but to look on it favorably as ameans to ease Western access to the country. Under the deal the Taliban willrequire the use of software to block "anti-Taliban Web sites."            Inevitably, some of the reporting on Clinton's economics speech suggeststhat it had Lewinsky-driven spin value. The LAT calls the speech"hastily scheduled," and the WP speaks of presidential aides painting apicture of an "engaged" president. Well, why not--that's the next step afterdating.
