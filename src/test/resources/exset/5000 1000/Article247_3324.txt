                                 "Going Nasdaq" on Taiwan                           USA Today andthe WashingtonPost lead with the designation of West Virginia and parts of Kentucky,Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia as federal disaster areas, a storyfronted by the New YorkTimes . Farmers in these regions--who are suffering the worst droughtsince the 1930s--are now eligible for low-interest federal loans, which would,says USAT , cover up to 80 percent of their losses. The NYTleads with the EPA's prohibition of two fruit-and-vegetable pesticides, a storyfronted by the Los AngelesTimes . The pesticides kill insects by interfering with their nervoussystem; some fear the agent may affect the nervous systems of children,although there are no hard data. The LAT's top non-local story is amassive head-on train collision involving 2,500 people in India, a story at thetop of the Wall StreetJournal's front-page "Worldwide" box and reefered by USAT .The Post and NYT put the death toll at over 200 (many of whomwere burned alive or dismembered) but the LAT , with a later deadline,says the number approaches 400. A signal failure was the likely cause.            All the papers except USAT front China's unusual announcement of along-range missile test within its territory. Almost every paper has adifferent angle: the Journal notes that the announcement willfrustrate efforts to prevent North Korea from testing its own missiles; theNYT says the announcement was done in tandem with a harsh publiccritique of the United States for selling military technology to Taiwan; thePost puts the missile test in the ninth paragraph of a larger story onincreased sorties over the Taiwan Strait by Chinese and Taiwanese militaryjets. In separate stories, the NYT and Post report that aChinese court meted out harsh prison sentences to two political dissidents. ThePost notes that since NATO's accidental May 7 bombing of the ChineseEmbassy in Belgrade, China has sentenced nine dissidents to prison terms of upto 10 years.            The Post and NYT front a decision by a federal districtjudge to throw out most of a 3-year-old Federal Election Commission lawsuitagainst the beleaguered Christian Coalition. The judge ruled that, in all buttwo cases, the Christian Coalition's distribution of voting guides did notconstitute specific endorsement of candidates--which would have amounted to anillegal campaign contribution. The decision is expected to allow more citizengroups to distribute election literature in 2000 without the burden of FECregulation.            The Post and Journal both run articles on the risks andrewards of day trading, which apparently contributed to the recent massacre inAtlanta. The Post says it's not surprising that the rise ofnon-professional, home-based Internet trading can encourage the occasionalbankrupted player to "go Nasdaq"--as Mark Barton's murders have been termed.Most traders sit at home alone, get unreliable tips through chat rooms, andlose their own money rather than that of a client. The Journalacknowledges these risks but argues that day trading makes financial marketsmore efficient and provides greater odds than (other) legalized forms ofgambling, such as lotto and blackjack.            On the NYT op-ed page, former Clinton economic advisor LauraD'Andrea Tyson tries to convince the financial markets that last week's reportof unexpectedly high labor costs in the second quarter does not necessarilymean the economy is overheating. As if in divine confirmation of her argument,the Journal notes that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have climbed over8 percent for the first time in two years, signaling an end to the housingboom. And the Post reports that economic growth and price increases inthe manufacturing sector were less than predicted in July, "easing Wall Streetfears of an overheating economy."            Writing on the LAT opinion page, contributing editor Robert Scheermakes the provocative argument that the quickest way to halt China'sbelligerence is to simply hand over all our nuclear warhead and ballisticssecrets. China's current saber rattling, Scheer reasons, stems from aninferiority complex about its relatively primitive nuclear arsenal. Once Chinahas a deterrent equal to that of the United States, Scheer says, it won't feelthe need to taunt its neighbors after every tiny technological advance.
