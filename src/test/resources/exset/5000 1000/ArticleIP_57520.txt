Randy's Wrap-Up                        To thoughtful quizparticipants (thoughtful in the sense of "acutely thinking," not in the senseof "considerately sending a Hanukkah gift to the quiz wrangler whose shirt sizeis 15/34 and whose liquor size is one liter), chills can be induced by bothfear and joy, particularly erotic joy. That the first sort of chill is easilytransmuted to the second may explain why scary movies are popular date-nightentertainment: To be scared is a short step from being sexually aroused. (Holdme!) This theory goes a long way to explain vampire movies, which are both; andMeryl Streep movies about inspirational music teachers, which are neither. Itmay also be that any intense emotion can be transformed into any other, whichis why the best part of breakin' up can indeed be makin' up, and why apassionate quarrel can culminate in a yet more passionate reconciliation. Itmay also explain the expression "scared stiff" (in the sense of tumescent, notin the sense of immobilized by drunken overindulgence in a gift bottle ofbourbon that one never received). Happy Hanukkah, everybody!                           Golly GenomeAnswer                        "I don't often pick up a scientific paper and findmyself getting chills, as I did when I saw this whole chromosomallandscape ."            Dr. Collins was reacting to an account of the firstsequencing of a human chromosome, No. 22, described in the current issue ofNature magazine.            An international consortium of university centerstook 10 years to achieve this milestone in the human genome project, whose goalis to decipher all human DNA by 2005. Although it is the second smallest of the23 pairs of human chromosomes, No. 22 contains 43 million units of DNA, ofwhich researchers have decoded 33.5 million. The team has identified 535 genesof the 1,000 or so thought to be on No. 22. The total number of human genes isestimated at between 60,000 and 120,000.            The genome sequence isposted at www.genome.ou.edu/Chr22.html.
