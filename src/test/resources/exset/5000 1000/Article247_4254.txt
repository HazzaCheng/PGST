                                 Not So Silent Night            The front pages of the Christmas papers are splashed with violence andbloodshed. The Washington Post lead reports that soldiers in the IvoryCoast mounted a coup d'etat, ousting President Henri Konan Bedie and suspendingthe country's constitution, courts, and parliament. "I will take care ofeverybody. You should not be worried," announced retired Gen. Robert Guei, whoclaimed to be in charge. Meanwhile, army troops and civilians alike pillagedthe capital city of Abidjan. The soldiers' motives are still unclear-- someseem to be after back pay, while others said they specifically wanted to toppleBedie. Bedie may be under house arrest or may have taken refuge at the Frenchambassador's residence-- no one's sure yet. The papers describe the Ivory Coastas a former oasis of stability in war-torn West Africa.            The New York Times and Los AngelesTimes front the hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight bound fromKatmandu to New Delhi with 189 people abroad (the WP reefers the story).Since terrorists seized it on Friday, the plane has touched down in India,Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Afghanistan. The hijackers claim tohave killed four passengers, but so far they've released only one corpse, alongwith three men, nine women, and 13 children. The papers tentatively identifythe hijackers as Sikhs, but don't give any background on their history orgoals. (The Sikh minority has long sought freedom from Indian rule. Manymoderate Sikhs seek autonomy; more extreme factions want independence, and havelong used violent means to pursue it.) The NYT tentatively speculatesthat the hijacking is related to the Indian-Pakistani tug-of-war over Kashmirbut doesn't say how. The LAT mentions the possibility that thehijackers are Kashmiris.            The LAT lead wonders if U.S. law enforcement officials are too quickto broadcast warnings about terrorist threats to the public. By erring "on theside of overexposure," authorities may be encouraging mass paranoia. Asevidence for this nationwide hysteria, the story quotes a gun shop owner in LasVegas who's been unloading an unusually high number of gas masks andbulletproof vests (if ammo shops in Las Vegas are a reliable indicator of thecountry's mood, then Today's Papers is moving to Denmark). The story also saysthat disclosure of the threats generates intense media coverage, which in turnmeans that the extremist groups get exactly what they're after--nationalpublicity. The tell-all policy is a reaction to the explosion of Pan Am Flight103 in 1988, when the State Department was condemned for sharing some threatswith its embassies but not with the public. Many of the points in the storywere stated in an op-ed in Thursday's NYT written by a former CIA-nik.These arguments seem to have migrated a little too quickly from the NYTto the LAT and from the op-ed page to the front page.            A WP front pager reports that Canadian authorities have issued anarrest warrant for Abdelmajed Dahoumane, former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, theman arrested last week for trying to enter Washington state while carryingingredients for explosives. Workers at the Vancouver motel where they'd stayedsaid their room stank of rotten eggs--more evidence that they may have beenbrewing up bombs. The WP reminds readers that on Christmas Eve fiveyears ago, armed hijackers from an Algerian independence group with whichRessam is linked hijacked an Air France jet. They were foiled when Frenchanti-terrorist commandos stormed the jet as it was parked and killed theterrorists.            The LAT reports that very little of last year's $206 billionsettlement between states and tobacco companies is being used for anti-smokingprograms. Instead, the money is being used for sundry bread-and-butterprojects: new sidewalks, tax cuts, boot camps, school construction. The suit,of course, was filed expressly to fund anti-smoking efforts.            Front-page reports in the WP and LAT report that millennialChristmas Eve in Bethlehem was peaceful, if a bit sparsely attended--manyvisitors stayed away from fear of violence. Meanwhile, midnight mass St.Peter's Basilica in the Vatican was thronged with worshippers. Perhaps theycame for the e-goodies: this year, the Vatican produced "pilgrim cards"embedded with microchips, which visitors can swipe to reserve seats at masses,on tour buses, and in restaurants.
