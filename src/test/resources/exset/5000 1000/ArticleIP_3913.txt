That IsAll Ye Know on Earth                        Nicereview by Judith Shulevitz ("Modern Makeup").But who is this historian-author Kathy Peiss? What an interesting idea for abook. Is it readable prose? I mean, for 25 bucks I want to know first if she'sa credible researcher and secondly whether I'll stay awake for the read. I'mbeing picky because I'm really thinking of buying the book--Shulevitz's reviewcompels me. So, red light/green light?            -- Kate Nolan                                       JudithShulevitz responds: Good question, and one I should have answered more clearlyin my review.                                       So here's the informationI should have provided: The book's a fine read, if not a rollicking one. Theresearch is excellent and Peiss' presentation subtle and nuanced. Peiss is ahistory professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the authorof a book called Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure inTurn-of-the-Century New York , which I have not read but which is said bymore knowledgeable friends to be a substantial contribution to the history ofwomen in America. Should you buy Hope in a Jar ? Why not? You'll learnlots of things you hadn't known, you'll think about makeup in a new way, andyou'll be spared the ranting about the evils of consumerism that so oftenaccompanies social histories of women, beauty, and fashion.                                       Thanksfor asking. Hope this helps.                                       ForRicher or for Poorer                        Eric Alterman ("Diary") says that he and his spouse-equivalent aren't gettingmarried because their federal taxes would skyrocket. He might want to check hisarithmetic and reconsider. However lamentable the "marriage penalty" may be,his examples vastly overstate its size.            For a two-earner couplemaking $150,000 split evenly, Alterman claims a staggering marriage penalty of$7,700. But that's not even close: The actual figures are $1,140 for a couplewith no children and $1,700 for a couple with two kids.            For two earners each making$23,350, Alterman is serendipitously close to the mark when he asserts amarriage penalty of $1,001 a year. The actual amounts are $84 for childlesscouples and $883 for a couple with one child. (The jump in the penalty fromhaving a child is mainly due to the fact that a single parent making $23,750gets a $500 earned-income tax credit, while a couple making $46,700 isineligible for that credit.) But one suspects this is not the example thatactually worries Alterman.            Finally, in the examplethat's apparently nearest to Alterman's heart--two potential spouses making$125,000 and $40,000--he says, "a year of marriage costs the same as a year ofday care." He must have found a bargain rate. The actual penalties in this caseare $774 for childless couples and $2,681 for couples with one kid. That latterfigure is certainly not nothing, but it's only 1.6 percent of the couple's$165,000 total income.            By theway, I've long been a hawk for eliminating the marriage penalty. But such astep wouldn't mean Alterman and his potential spouse's taxes would go downmuch. In the $125,000-$40,000 scenario, for instance, a deficit-neutralsolution would increase their taxes by $2,000 or so (compared with now) if theyremain single and cut their taxes by about $550 if they get married.            -- Robert S.McIntyre Director, Citizens for Tax JusticeWashington, D.C.

We need people who can play the game and getthe pork.            -- Tom Swick                                       Addressyour e-mail to the editors to letters@slate.com.
