All together now, from the top . . . In the weekafter Christmas my true love gave to me 10 college bowls, 9 hours of wrestling,8 NFL games, 7 figure skaters, 6 soccer players, 5 college hoops match ups, 4hockey goalies, 3 rounds of pro golf, 2 ABL games, and the Branson, Mo.,lumberjack finals.            OK. There are, in fact, 14 bowl games in the comingweek, and pro wrestling is more "sports entertainment" than actual sport.Nonetheless, these are heady days for sports fans. Gridiron junkies inparticular can kick back in the Barcalounger at 11:00 New Years morn (CottonBowl, Fox; Outback Bowl, ESPN) and vanish into a festival of testosterone untilthe final gun sounds on the Sugar Bowl (ABC, 8:30) some time aroundmidnight.            Sadly, for non-sports addicts, the holiday seasoncontinues its grim run. The series repeats continue apace, and the movieselections aren't much more appealing than last week's offerings. Exhibits Aand B: NBC's Free Willy 2 (Sun., 7:00)--as if the theme music from thefirst movie didn't make you want to take harpoon lessons--and TNT'sinexplicable back-to-back showings of Sidekicks , the 1993 flop starringChuck Norris as himself--only taller (Wed., 8:00, 10:15).            Even in the darkest weeks, however, there is aglimmer of relief. UPN, for instance, is showing Miller's Crossing (Sun.8:00), the Coen brothers' 1990 paean to the gangster flick. Fargo 'sOscar success notwithstanding, Miller's                Crossing remains theCoen's best offering. Beautifully acted, beautifully scored, and mostbeautifully shot, it gives a self-conscious nod to mob-movie romanticismwithout gutting the myth a la Scorsese's 1990 gangster hit, Goodfellas .(It also provides the best role Gabriel Byrne is ever likely to get: halfRichard Burton, half Al Pacino)            Seven o'clock Thursday morning, the Sci-Fi Channellaunches its Twilight Zone marathon--21 hours of the eeriest seriesever. The show's ridiculous special effects would send Industrial Light &Magic into giggling fits, and much of the acting is barely second rate. But ithas some of the best theme music in television history, and Rod Serling's voicecan raise the hair on the back of my neck quicker than a scene out ofShowgirls . My favorite episode: A burglar is shot dead while fleeing acrime scene and is transported to a wondrous place where every desire isimmediately indulged--hot babes as far as the eye can see. After a few days,the burglar grows bored of paradise and confronts the Saint Peter-esque fellowin charge, arguing that Heaven is not really his bag. "Heaven?" thebeatific-looking gatekeeper asks with amusement. "What makes you think you'rein Heaven?"            What can I say? I was raised SouthernBaptist.            As for more modern fare, you're pretty safe withNBC's Thursday line-up-- Frasier (9:00), ER (10:00), and, after along dry spell even Friends (8:00) appears to be on the upswing.Reminiscent of the first couple of seasons, the dialogue is sharp andwicked--although this time around, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) seems to be getting moreof the good punchlines than Chandler (Matthew Perry), a shift that's promptedmuch musing around my house about shifting relationships between actors andwriters in an ensemble cast. (Perhaps Matthew Perry is doing penance for hisunfortunate experiments on the big screen.) The Monica-Chandler covert romanceis as ripe for comic exploitation as the early days of Ross' Rachel fixation,but it doesn't try to bait viewers into watching with the tired "Ooh, maybenext week they'll get together" gimmick so many sit-com writers seemto fancy. Sure, maybe Monica and Chandler's secret love will be revealed thisweek, or maybe not. What does it matter? They're together. They're happy.They're getting laid. Life is good. I don't watch sit-coms to befrustrated.            (Caution: Some NBC affiliates are screwing aroundwith this week's Thursday programming, replacing the regular line-up withepisodes of The Pretender and the failed Wind on Water . Viewerdiscretion advised.)            Finally, whatever your plans for New Year's Eve, setthe VCR to record ABC's New                Year's Rockin' Eve '99 (11:35). Anyyear now could be Dick Clark's last. And should he happen to bite the big applewhile broadcasting live from Times Square, you do not want to missit.            -- Michelle Cottle
