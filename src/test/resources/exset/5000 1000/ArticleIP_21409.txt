Thursday's Question (No. 202)--"Death Sentence?": Under pressure fromthe Federal Trade Commission, R.J. Reynolds will add a single sentence to eachprint ad for Winston. Saying what?                                       "Bannedin California, but now qualifies as an assisted-suicide device inOregon."-- Daniel Radosh                        "Due tointerference from the Federal Trade Commission, R.J. Reynolds regrets toannounce that it will no longer include a free toy in every pack ofWinstons."-- Tim Carvell                        "Nocartoon camels were used in the marketing of this product."-- MattSullivan ( Ian Henley and Kate Powers had similaranswers.)

Randy'sWrap-Up                        After smoking a pack of Camels a day for a dozenyears, I gave it up in 1985. I still miss it. Cigarettes stimulate thought,distract from woe, and require playing with matches. Cigarettes promoteintimacy: What could be sexier than sharing a smoke, passing that small firefrom hand to hand? Cigarettes impose form on your day; they are a means ofdemarcation: You smoke one after something and before something else. And theylook so cool. I'd be smoking right now if it weren't for the part about thehideous respiratory illness and coughing away my life in a painful andprotracted demise.            I intend to resume thehabit as a delight of old age; my first Social Security check will just aboutcover the cost of a carton. Smoking will offer a reliable indoor pleasure thatI can enjoy seated, much to be desired in my decrepitude. And malignancydevelops slowly. With a little luck, by the time I contract a fatal disease,I'll already be dead. You'd think instead of messing around with Winston, RJRwould produce a brand it can market to old folks. Call it Golden One Hundreds.Use the slogan: "Hey, Granny, feeling lucky?"                           Delightful DoubleNegative Answer                        "No additives in our tobacco does not mean a safercigarette."            Winston's "no bull" adsproclaim that the cigarettes are 100 percent tobacco with no additives. RJR wasshocked--shocked!--to learn that some might interpret this as a health claim.In the 18 months since the campaign began, Winston's market share rose from4.86 percent to 4.93 percent.
