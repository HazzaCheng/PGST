                                 Papal Bull                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with the White House response toKathleen Willey. The New YorkTimes leads with the Vatican's official repentance regarding the masskillings of Jews during World War II. And the Los AngelesTimes goes with the news that the first three University of Californiacampuses to generate admissions statistics since the system abandonedaffirmative action have seen their black and Latino acceptance ratesplummet.            Yesterday's White House response to Willey was primarily two-fold: a strongdenial from President Clinton, and the release of a raft of friendly lettersWilley sent to the White House after the date she alleges she was groped byClinton. In one letter, widely quoted, she calls herself Clinton's "number onefan." In another, Willey asks to be appointed to an ambassadorship. TheNYT says some of the letters were "effusive." And a piece insideUSAT says they "do not suggest a woman who felt betrayed." (There wasalso the effort of Clinton's personal lawyer, Robert Bennett, noted by theNYT and USAT , to portray Willey as mercenary for trying to land abook deal.)            None of the day's coverage of the Willey letters pays the slightest heed tothe well-known phenomenon of even physically abused women having troubleexpressing their animosity towards their abusers or physically separating fromthem. It's as if nobody in the entire press corps remembers that Nicole BrownSimpson moved back in with O.J. after those pictures were taken of her pummeledface.            Despite the six-cylinder spin cycle, USAT says that "there was noignoring the dark mood that settled over the White House" in Willey's wake. Thepaper noted a rare moment of anger by Mike McCurry, who lashed out at areporter who asked him whether Clinton had ever received psychologicaltreatment or counseling for risky and reckless behavior.            The WP lead makes that point that when originallyconfronted with the Willey charges, Clinton released a statement saying that hehad "no specific recollection" of meeting with her, but that his current denialis based on "a very clear memory" of the meeting.                           USAT notes that Ann Lewis, who spearheaded the anti-Willeycounteroffensive yesterday with an appearance on the "Today" show, was aleading supporter of Anita Hill. But the Post lead puts a finer point onthe matter, noting, "Democratic activists--Lewis among them--had accusedRepublicans of attacking the victim when they noted in the Clarence Thomasconfirmation hearings in 1991 that Anita Hill had continued to stay in closetouch with Thomas even after he allegedly harassed her with lewd sexualremarks."            Such apparently effortless shifting by some women is called to taskpointedly in the Wall Street Journal 's main "Politics and Policy" piece viaa quotation from a Democratic consultant, who says, "What gets to the heart ofit is that feminism is no longer a principle, it's a political tool."            The NYT lead concerning the Vatican points out that while thedocument issued Monday is described by the Church as "an act of repentance" forthe failure of Roman Catholics to deter the mass killings in Europe during theHolocaust, it skirts the issue of the Vatican's institutional shortcomingsduring the era, primarily its official silence about the Nazis. The document,says the paper, took 11 years to prepare, and was greeted coolly by Jewishleaders. Everybody carries the repentance story on the front page.            Everybody's front page also carries word that the McKinney trial jury didn'tsend the former sergeant major of the Army to jail, but did bust him down onerank, a move that will cost him $10,000 a year in pension money. Also, McKinneysued his initial accuser for libel, asking $1.5 million. Meanwhile, theLAT and NYT fronts report that Defense Secretary William Cohenrejected an advisory commission's recommendation that male and female recruitsbe housed separately during training.            The NYT runs the following correction: "Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 26about Manhattanites' reliance on mini-storage referred incorrectly to doves anda rabbit used in the act of Arnie Kolodner, a magician. While he keeps costumesin mini-storage, the rabbit and doves live in his home. A correction in thisspace on Saturday omitted mention of the rabbit."
