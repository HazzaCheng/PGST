                                 Chase to the Cut            Everybody leads with Tuesday's widely anticipated Federal Reserve interestrate cut. The headlines at USA Today , the Los AngelesTimes and the New YorkTimes indicate that the move was taken to protect the U.S. economy fromthe global troubles. The headline over the Wall Street Journal front-pager on the cut doesn't say whyit was made but the story immediately mentions concerns about how weaknesses inforeign economies might affect our own. The Washington Post headline says the move was meant to help("quiet") overseas markets.            The Fed dropped the fed funds rate--what banks charge each other forovernight loans--from 5.5 percent to 5.25 percent--but, contrary to someexpectations, left the discount rate it charges banks for loans at 5 percent.Although all the papers have, as usual, no problem finding some experts toforesee up trends on rates and some to foresee down ones, their lines on theinterest rate future shake out this way: the LAT suggests in its thirdparagraph further rate reductions of up to a full percentage point;USAT , in its sixth paragraph, quotes an economist saying there's noindication of another Fed move anytime soon; in its sixth paragraph, thePost says the narrow language of the Fed announcement strongly indicatesthis also. The NYT holds off its initial rate forecast until thetwenty-third paragraph, a comment that many analysts think further reductionsare likely. All the papers except the WSJ tend to suggest that rates aredriven by Fed policy. Characteristically, the ever-market-orientedJournal stresses that the Fed's action had already been anticipated bylong-term bonds with yields at thirty-year lows.            The WP off-lead is a strongly reported effort towards a scaryconclusion: the Iraqis are surprisingly close to having A-bombs.(Surely this should have been the lead story!) According to the story, UN armsinspectors reported twice to U.S. authorities--in 1996 and in 1997--that theyhad credible intelligence indicating that while still lacking the fissile fuelfor such bombs, the Iraqis had built and maintained three or four implosiondevices. If fueled, says the paper, they'd each be A-bombs larger than the onedropped at Hiroshima. These charges were first made by former UN inspectorScott Ritter but when he made them they were assessed by senior U.S.policy-makers as not credible. However, the paper says, new evidence emergingthis week has convinced the U.S. officials most responsible for suchassessments. The Post says the information was obtained from Iraqidefectors. It includes such details as that the Iraqis used a fleet ofdistinctively marked Mercedes trucks to shuttle the bomb frames among hidingplaces. Ritter says that one defector sketched a map depicting seven of thesedepots. The paper says U-2 spy planes found five of them.            The LAT and NYT carry front-page obits on Tom Bradley, the first black mayor of Los Angeles, (the NYTpoints out high up that he was the first black mayor of a major city and of alargely white one) who died yesterday at age 80. Bradley, the son ofsharecroppers and the grandson of slaves, was mayor from 1973 to 1993. TheLAT cites as his principal accomplishments, a downtown building boom,the 1984 Olympics success, creating coalitions between blacks and Jews andlabor and management, with an accompanying racial peace lasting most of histenure, and establishing civilian control over the LAPD. The paper also notesthe personal financial scandals and the Rodney King-inspired riots of his lastterm in office.            On a relatively Monica-free news day, the NYT op-ed page, in clearcontrast to the NYT editorial page, is still working hard to keepscandal pressure off Bill Clinton. Today's palaver palette offers Frank Richexcoriating Beltway pundits, Gene McCarthy arguing that special prosecutors areinherently anti-democratic, Maureen Dowd mitigating the presidential pruriencewith a sexual ineptness defense and an Alabama reporter's discussing what anice scandal break folks down his way got by being clobbered by HurricaneGeorges.            The WP reports that starting tomorrow, all airlines are required toask any U.S. citizen traveling to or from the United States something they'venot routinely asked before--the name of their next of kin. Why? Well, in case of what the paper notesIcelandair calls a "disruption of our service."
