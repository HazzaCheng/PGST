                                 Tamrazmatazz            Roger Tamraz leads at the Washington Post --and grabs plenty of front-page spaceelsewhere. The New York Times leads with the guilty pleas enteredby three Teamsters officials in connection with a scheme to launderunion-election contributions. The shake-up announced at China's Communist Partycongress leads at the Los Angeles Times , and USA Todaygoes with the record surpluses accumulating in state coffers.            Tamraz, a naturalized American citizen from Lebanon, told the Thompsonhearings that the only reason he gave $300,000 to the DNC was so he could gainhigh-level government support for a pet project. This sort of statement of theobvious is known in Washington as "candor," and especially because Tamrazshowed up without a lawyer and smiled and laughed throughout the day, his brandof it was enthusiastically received by the powers that be, including thenewspapers. The WP says he "entertained" the committee, and theNYT notes his quickness with one-liners. The picture running with theNYT story makes it look as if Tamraz was feeling the tremendous pressureof a prosecutorial grilling. But in fact, the only sort of question he had toanswer was: Did you get your money's worth? ("Next time, I'll give $600,000,"was his reply.) The WP picture of the witness table is more in line withreality: Just a bunch of rich guys in suits having fun. (To get SLATE's take on the Thompson hearings, read Jacob Weisberg's dailydispatches.)            The NYT details how three top campaign aides to Teamsters PresidentRon Carey pleaded guilty yesterday to funneling illegal contributions toCarey's re-election drive. The three stated that their scheme--disguisingimproper contributions to Carey from the AFL-CIO and other unions--involvedofficials of the DNC and of the president's re-election campaign.                           USAT brings news that state treasuries are billions of dollars in theblack, primarily because the economy's surge has boosted tax revenues andshrunk welfare rolls. Just about the only exception is Hawaii, which isexperiencing a nasty recession because (Japanese) tourism is down. The paperreports that in general, the states are reacting conservatively, plowing mostof the found money into tax cuts, schools, and contingency funds.            The LAT says that President Jiang Zemin firmly established himself asChina's top leader with the appointments of allies and nonappointments ofrivals announced Thursday. This story also runs above the fold at the WPand the NYT 's national edition.            In the business and finance news box of the Wall Street Journal , there's word (credited to yesterday'sDetroit News ) that in a move to retain white-collar employees, Chrysleris offering 15,000 nonunion salaried workers a grant of $4,000 forfamily-related expenses like elder care and children's college tuition.            The LAT front page gives an early picture of a stratagem sure tobecome popular among advocates of affirmative action in college admissions. TheLatino Eligibility Task Force, composed of University of California faculty andadministrators from all nine of its campuses, warns that continued use of theSAT test as an admissions criterion could mean a drop of up to 70 percent inthe number of Latino students at UCLA and Berkeley, the system's two mostselective campuses. But the committee has a solution: eliminate the SAT as arequirement, which would "more than double the number of Latinos eligible foradmissions." Surprisingly, given that Prop. 209 architect Ward Connerly is onthe U.C. Board of Regents, the paper reports that the regents are "receptive"to the idea.            Al Kamen's WP column states that, when Sen. John Ashcroft took to theSenate floor on Wednesday to argue for defunding the NEA, he quoted approvinglyfrom the work of NEA critic and frequent LAT contributor Jan Breslauer.Kamen points out that Ashcroft didn't mention Breslauer also recently wrote apiece for Playboy called "Stacked Like Me" describing her recentdecision to perk up her boring life by getting 34D breast implants. Kamen'spiece appears under the subhead "Ashcroft Takes on Two Endowments."            A question for Post copy editors: Shouldn't that be "Three"?
