                                 The Dark Side of the Alpha Male                        Dear Todd ...            I feel like we are really starting to bond now. I, too, have never seen anepisode of Moesha , and even more amazing, I have never even read a TVGuide description of an episode.            However, I think you will be impressed when you learn that I was actuallyplanning to attend the opening weekend of Pokmon: The First Movie so Icould discuss it with you here. Although I have never seen that TV show either,I have been regularly purchasing assorted Pokmon merchandise for my two crazynephews. But then it began to occur to me that if I showed up alone at a publicscreening of Pokmon , I would soon begin to notice the parents ofchildren hugging their young ones close to them as they eyed me with horror andsuspicion. I began to rehearse excuses about where my absent kid might be."He's ... uh ... in the lobby returning phone calls." Then it dawned on me thatthere could well be some kind of a city ordinance against a lone adultattending a screening of Pokmon unaccompanied by a child. So, sadly, Inever went. However I could not fail to notice that in today's paper we learnthat the Pokmon movie was "the highest grossing Wednesday premiere ofany film to open in November." Now that is an accolade to be proud of.This whole tradition of being really, really specific in the details of thehonor you are bestowing is a trend I applaud and would like to see expand. Iwonder what the highest grossing Friday premiere in a month ending with an Rduring a World Series playoff game was? And what would be wrong with a categoryin the Academy Awards for "Best Actress in a Top-10 Christmas Film That OpenedBetween Thanksgiving and the 15 th of December"?            Before I get off the topic of show business, I also noticed a lot of itemsabout the questionable ratings of the new Martin Short talk show. King Worldexecutive Andy Friendly is quoted as saying, "We've lightened up the show witha new backdrop and more female-oriented material." It has been my experiencethat once the executives start lightening things up with a new backdrop, it isonly a matter of weeks until the launch of a segment called "Send us your homevideotapes!!!" And then, I'm afraid, we will have to bid them all a fondfarewell.            Moving right along, are these darn guys running for president now moretransparently phoney than usual or is it just me and my razor-keenobservational abilities? Not just because George W. couldn't name leaders ofworld hot spots. (Although I loved his answer regarding the prime minister ofIndia, which went, "The prime minister of India is ... I don't know." Heapparently was thinking that if he got up a head of steam and energeticallyrepeated the question, the answer might come to him from nowhere.) But I justread a piece in which the supporters of George W. are explaining theirattraction to him with thoughts like "Don't ask me what draws me to him. I wasterribly fond of his parents, so he has a place in my heart." This makes methink that more of the candidates should be using a "get to know my parents"kind of an angle in their campaigns.            And as for the ever-morphing Al Gore, pictured this weekend wearing an armyhat for Veterans Day, maybe he should just hire a spokesmodel to deliver hisspeeches while he's figuring out who to be. By the way, I think he got thewrong message about being an alpha male from Naomi Wolf. In my opinion, theproper route to appearing more alpha is not earth tones, as suggested,but would be for him to wear a leather jacket, suck on a cigarette butt, andmake a bunch of appointments to meet with women's groups that he suddenlycancels at the very last second without offering an explanation. Nowthat's an alpha male as I have come to know and love them. (His otheroption would be to employ the technique they explain in dog-training manualsfor use when you have a problem dominating your alpha-male pet. What they tellyou to do is to pin him down and lie on top of him. If Gore tried that onBradley during their next debate, I think we might all see him a littledifferently.)            Your new best friend,Merrill
