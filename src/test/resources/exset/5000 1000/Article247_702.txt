                                 Government Shutdown? No, Government Shut Up!            The Washington Post leads with yesterday's partisanspitballs: President Clinton declared that congressional Republicans are soscandal-frenzied that that they haven't yet passed the appropriations measuresnecessary to start the new fiscal year. Republicans immediately issuedretaliatory fire. The New YorkTimes leads with a Census Bureau report that the ranks of Americanswithout health insurance swelled by 1.7 million last year. The Los AngelesTimes leads with Hurricane Georges' 100mph whirl through the FloridaKeys, a story also carried on the WP and NYT fronts. Despite 300deaths in the Caribbean, no casualties have yet been reported in Florida.            The NYT lead says that 16.1% of Americans (43.4 million people) areuninsured, the highest number since 1992. The number of poor who are uninsuredheld steady, while the middle class suffered a hit. This development issurprising, the Times notes, because the economy is so robust. Among thepossible explanations for the trend: Fewer people are on welfare, which is anautomatic gateway to Medicaid coverage; small businesses, which dominate thenew-job sector, often do not provide health insurance; and costs associatedwith health care and health insurance are increasing.            The WP lead (mirrored in a NYT front-page article) reportsthat an "invigorated" Clinton averted a federal shutdown--the new fiscal yearstarts next week--by signing a temporary funding measure Friday. Clinton usedthe opportunity to castigate Congress for putting "partisanship over progress,politics over people" and dallying on important issues. Senate Majority LeaderTrent Lott quarterbacked the Republican counter-attack, calling Clinton'sremarks a "gratuitous slap" from the "Fundraiser-in-Chief," a reference toClinton's imminent departure for a three-day fundraising trip.            Acrimony spewed fast and fierce yesterday. The LAT off-lead peddlesthe paper's telephone interview with Newt Gingrich, in which the House Speakercalled for the President to waive his attorney-client privilege and cooperatewith the impeachment inquiry. Gingrich lashed out against "the level ofarrogance and duplicity by this White House. To this day, they haven't told thetruth."            In more Lewinsky developments, reported all around: Another batch of Starrdocuments is headed to the Government Printing Office for release to the publiclate next week. Edited versions of the taped conversations between Linda Trippand Monica Lewinsky will also be released sometime thereafter.            The NYT and WP both run inside stories, albeit with differentslants, on Germany's down-to-the-wire race for Sunday's elections. TheNYT emphasizes that the two main parties--Helmut Kohl's ChristianDemocrats and Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats--have fundamentallyidentical platforms. Since both pledge to continue Germany's strong socialprograms, support the introduction of the euro, and implement tax reform, theelection may come down to German voters' personal opinions of Kohl. But do thevoters themselves know what they think? Not yet. The WP says that one infive German voters remain undecided. The WP article sketches outpossible post-election coalition arrangements.            The WP reports inside that the Pentagon called Friday for a review ofall military Internet sites which are accessible publicly. While not catalyzedby any particular event, the Pentagon's action reflects a variety of securityconcerns, including the online availability of personal data aboutservicemen.            Now, a royal example of how to decline a gift: The WP Style "Namesand Faces" column reports that Auckland University's Injury Prevention Centredonated a pair of panties to Queen Elizabeth. Not just any panties, mindyou--they had special hip-protector inserts for the 98-year-old Queen Mother.The gift was returned to the university with a note of polite refusal from theQueen Mother's lady-in-waiting--thank you, but the gift was too much of a"personal nature" to accept.
