                                 Hillary to New York: Drop Everything            Both USAToday and the Washington Post lead with Hillary Clinton's announcementyesterday that she will definitely run for the U.S. Senate in New York againstlikely opponent Rudy Giuliani. Somewhat surprisingly, the New York Times , although frontingthe announcement, does not lead with it, opting instead for President Clinton'svisit to Kosovo, which included get-togethers with Kosovar Albanians (he urgedthem to forgive the Serbs) and with American peacekeeping soldiers (he remindedthem that the U.S. military is an excellent example of how different ethnicgroups can get along). The tops of both Times feature pictures ofClinton among the troops. The WP runs one a bit lower. The NYTand Post versions look like a campaign meet-and-greet, but the Los AngelesTimes shot evokes the more intimate feeling of a leader with histroops: It's good to be the commander in chief. The LAT can only find abelow-the-fold reefer for Hillary and goes with a story nobody elsefronts--Tuesday's U.N. report on the worldwide AIDS situation. Among the grimnumbers, says the paper: By the end of the year, the cumulative toll from thedisease will be 16.3 million deaths and 50 million HIV infections. More than 70percent of all HIV cases live in sub-Saharan Africa, which contains but 10percent of the world's population. But, the paper continues, the region wherethe disease is growing the fastest is the former Soviet Union, largely due tothe rise there of intravenous drug use.            According to the coverage, Hillary Clinton's announcement came at a New York City meeting of a teacher'sunion. The WP says it had the feel of an orchestrated performance, whilethe NYT goes even further, saying that union sources said it was"scripted." Clinton said that she would move into her new Westchester Countyhouse as soon as the Secret Service said she could and that after the first ofthe year, she would scale back her activities as first lady. The NYTobserves this will mark the first time in 80 years that a president has livedin Washington sans first lady. But USAT is alone in commenting up highon an even more remarkable fact: For the first time ever, a president's wife isrunning for office.            The main coverage takes a what-elephant-in-the-parlor? approach to thedomestic implications of the first lady's announcement. Although it is reportedthat she said yesterday she had not told her husband or daughter of herdecision, nobody notes how this contrasts with the nearly universal traditionof a candidate announcing with spouse and offspring in tow. And there is nospeculation in the leads about whether the coming physical distance between thetwo Clintons represents a psychical one as well. (An NYT inside story, does briefly indulge, however.) This silence, whichmight even be mistaken for good taste, can't possibly last.            The LAT is alone in fronting the filing yesterday of class-actionlawsuits against five of the nation's largest HMOs. The suits, the paperreports, were filed by one of the leading attorneys in the cases against thetobacco companies that led to that industry's lavish financial settlement withmany states. The plaintiffs claim that the health plans have violated theirobligations to members, and even allege that they've engaged inracketeering.            The WP and Wall Street Journal report that a JAMA studypublished Tuesday suggests that despite widespread fears among women to thecontrary, the frequency of sexual activity and the pleasure derived from itremain the same or even increase after having a hysterectomy.            A front page WSJ feature looks past such arcana as pricing structuresand inventory management to find a simpler reason why discount retailersconsistently outperform traditional department stores: The former, but not thelatter, provide customers with shopping carts. Very simply, carts--no, duh!--enable shoppers tobuy more stuff.            The WP 's "Reliable Source" has great fun reporting that yesterdayformer Washington D.C. mayor Marion Barry was on jury duty in that city. Butthe column never stops to wonder how an ex-convict like Barry could serve on ajury. Indeed, although the column points out that the FBI has targeted Barry inthe past, it never mentions that he's done time.
