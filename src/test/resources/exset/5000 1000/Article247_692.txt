                                 Headline            After Today's Papers: Summary Judgment wraps up the reviews of the reviews.The papers continue to show they're much more interested in Mondo Monica thanthe American people are--all the majors lead with some aspect of it. USAT andthe LAT go with President Clinton's comments Wednesday at his first post-Reportpress conference that he still has the moral authority required to remain inoffice. The NYT goes with a story that led elsewhere yesterday--the imminentrelease of the Clinton grand jury videotape. The WP combines the two themes inits lead, running under the headline "Clinton Stresses Duties as House PlansDisclosure."                           USAT says that during his joint news conference with Czech PresidentVaclav Havel, Clinton "sidestepped" questions about whether he'd committedperjury. The LAT reports that most of the questions posed at theconference were about the Lewinsky scandal--including those from Czechjournalists (the front-page NYT story on the press conference alsoobserves this). The USAT account depicts a determined, fervent Clinton.The LAT sees political manipulation instead, calling Clinton's remarks"part of a determined effort by the White House to change the subject," andsaying it was "stage-managed to put the President in the best possible light,"and also referring to Monday's speech on the global economy as "a carefullychoreographed appearance." If USAT 's and the NYT 's quoting ofClinton saying, "I have never stopped leading this country in foreign affairsin this entire year, and I never will" makes the reader think of jut-jawedglobalism, by the time the LAT gets around to the remark, the reader ishalf-way thinking it's actually a coded reference to some as yet undetectedfrolicking with exchange students. In noting that "Clinton offered no defenseof his actions and voiced no protest as the House moved further down the tracktoward an impeachment inquiry," the WP story limns a third picture: of aman resigned to a process bigger than he is. The Post notes that whenasked if he might consider resigning, his response--the voters want him to dohis job--was less "steely" than the "Churchillian 'never'" he responded withlast February. The NYT agrees, saying his answer yesterday was lessconfrontational.            The NYT lead stresses the concerns of some Judiciary committeeRepublicans that some of the material suggested for imminent release is toographic. The paper reports that at a closed-door meeting with members, NewtGingrich seemed irritated by such scruples and won "a huge ovation" afterreminding attendees that the House had already voted for full disclosure, andthat pulling back now would only lead to news leaks. Also, both the Postand USAT report that Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde yesterdayacknowledged a 1960s extramarital affair and that the White House deniedleaking that information.            A front-page USAT story reports that the Pentagon has ordered areview of all DOD-maintained Web sites out of a concern that they may make toomuch information--including the names of commanders and the locations of theirfamilies--available to terrorists and other potential enemies. The paperreports, for instance, that one DOD site featured the floor plan and photos ofthe inside of the home of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.            A very good front-page WSJ feature by Douglas Blackmon makes the case thatAmerica is becoming more cultured. True, the piece admits, "Booty Call" made$20 million and Wonder remains the biggest single selling bread brand, but thecultural common denominator is on the rise. American book-buying is on adizzying upswing, more students are studying abroad, theatrical ticket salesare up, as is opera attendance, plus pubic radio stations have tripled since1980--and you can get cappuccino in Arkansas.            The LAT front runs a piece by veteran tobacco reporter Myron Levinthat may presage a whole new dimension of tobacco scandal. Citing internalmemos from the world's two largest tobacco companies, the piece details theirsecret agreement to fix prices in Argentina, Venezuela, and other LatinAmerican countries. The memos surfaced in a lawsuit brought by Washington stateand provide the first-ever documentation of tobacco companies' anti-competitivedeals. The story reminds that it's not just Bill Clinton who can't give asimple answer to a simple question--it quotes a Phillip Morris spokeswoman'sresponse: "Since we must comply with local laws and regulations in everycountry in which we do business, we expect that there has been no improperconduct in the countries that you have referenced." Not exactly "We didn't doanything wrong."
