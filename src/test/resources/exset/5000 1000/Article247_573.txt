                                 Pre-NATO Care            The LosAngeles Times , USA Today , and the Washington Post lead with the Senate passage and the likelypresidential veto of a bill saddling the Clinton goal of paying up UN dues witha GOP anti-abortion provision. The New York Timesgoes with the Senate's defeat of a proposal for limiting the cost to the U.S.of expanding NATO.            The UN dues bill includes a rider barring U.S. aid to international familyplanning groups that perform or support abortions, which, says the LAT ,"almost certainly dooms" the payback effort. The LAT and WP note that both Trent Lott and Jesse Helms say aveto means there will be no further action on this. USAT and theWP remind readers that House Republicans attached a similar poison pillprovision to the last attempt at a UN pay-up, which was vetoed by PresidentClinton.            The coverage plays into Washington's unfortunate preference for politicsover substance: there isn't a word about those international family planningorganizations (none are even identified) and to what extent they facilitateabortions.            The NYT reports that the Senate discussion concerning NATO continues to be lively, and thatthe cost cap was the first of perhaps two dozen NATO expansion amendments theSenate will consider before it's through. Yesterday's debate focused mainly onwhether or not the proposed new members--Poland, Hungary, and the CzechRepublic--can afford to field the level of armed forces NATO requires. TheTimes notes that expansion cost issues seem paramount to the Senate.This means many members don't really trust the official estimates, becauseofficially, expansion will cost but $40 million a year over the nextdecade--less than half a new fighter plane a year.            And the Times explains that some senators are concerned that more andmore new members will be coming in, hurting NATO's strength. It occurs to"Today's Papers" though, that here may lie the true solution: Let any countryjoin NATO. If members are required to promise not to attack each other, as thenumber of non-member countries declines, the alliance's military needs woulddiminish and hence so would its expenses.            Economic factoids: the LAT and USAT fronts report that thebooming economy has delayed the insolvency of Social Security for threeadditional years--until 2032. The WP runs this on the inside, butreports on its front that the Y2K problem will cost U.S. companies $50 billionand worldwide, the cost to business will be $300 billion.            Just days ago, the new warm and fuzzy Newt Gingrich was on tour with a bookmostly about diet and exercise. Well, judging from the WP second lead,book sales must have slipped and Newt is back on red meat. The paper quotesGingrich's assessment of the Clinton administration asengaged in "the most systematic, deliberate obstruction of justice cover-up andeffort to avoid the truth we have ever seen in American history, and the timehas come to say to the president, 'Quit undermining the law in the UnitedStates. Turn over the evidence.'"            Last fall, an LAT front-page spread made IRS abuses a big story. Thepaper stays on the case with a front-page account of a Senate hearing Tuesdaythat disclosed corruption among IRS officials: one was thought to have stolenas many as twenty confiscated luxury vehicles and another wrote an anonymousthreatening letter to a tax attorney who had testified against the agency atcongressional hearings. The WP runs the tax hearings inside. TheWall Street Journal "Tax Report" reports that JackRegan Stevens, a former IRS officer, pleaded guilty to embezzling 13 taxpayerpayments totaling more than $77,000 by altering payment checks made out to"IRS" so that they resembled his initials. The column also includes a modestproposal for ushering in a simplified tax code: require all members of Congressand the president to prepare their own returns without professional help.            Why is demi-billionaire California gubernatorial candidate Al Checchi aDemocrat? Because, he is quoted on the LAT op-ed page, "It's easier toteach economics to Democrats than compassion to Republicans."            "Today's Papers" is more than a little mystified by the sudden journalisticinterest in the reality of the Jerry Springer show. Pretty soon, the paperswill be breathlessly revealing that talk-show couch conversations are scriptedand that Sam Donaldson employs fake hair and real researchers. Still, the ideain a letter to today's Times from a Yale med school profis a good one: just put a cop on the Springer set. Real fights would meet witharrests and fake ones wouldn't and hence would be quickly unmasked. Either way,says the doc, the audience would evaporate.
