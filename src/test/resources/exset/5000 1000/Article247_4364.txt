                                 Wise Guys; Annoying Gals                        Dear Biggie,            Wait a frigging second--could you please explain to me the phallic symbolismof herring? Herring in cream sauce, maybe, but regular old herring?            Again, Judith, too many thoughts. I don't know where to begin with you. Oh,I know where--by telling you I finally get your Judith "De Man" Shulevitz joke.Like, De Man the Nazi-symp deconstructionist. You're pretty funny, for anintellectual. Let me repeat that last part--for an intellectual. (Dept. ofMortifying Amplification: I finally got the joke because someone explained itto me. OK, you explained it to me. Let's never talk about this again. I hateyou comp-lit people).            May I make one observation? There is way too much hype now about this show.Did you see the cover of TV Guide ? The cast is all there, and they're onthe cover of Entertainment Weekly , and they're in Vanity Fair ,and the newsweeklies, ad infinitum. This is crazy already. I feel the backlashbeginning.            OK. I don't like Richie Aprile, the new thug on the block, precisely becausehe's such a malevolent thug, at least so far (yeah, he's a bit New Agey, buthis whole yoga shtick feels forced, as if the writers decided that each andevery character had to be a member of the sensitive, slightly feminizedpostmodern mob). I think it's dangerous for The Sopranos to introduce anongoing character who's flat-out bad. (Though I guess that Mikey Palmice,Junior's now-dead henchman, filled that role last season.) All malevolence, allthe time, as you put it, is fine for Casino --think Joe Pesci--but inThe Sopranos ? The joy of The Sopranos is that all these bad-assgangsters are possessed of some complicating goodness, or at least some kind ofbenign dream of a better life.            But don't get me wrong: I much prefer the addition of a flat-out gangster tothe cast than yet another annoying woman (uh oh, am I in trouble now?).            By annoying, I am referring to Tony's sister, who is with us for the entireseason, apparently. Talk about a drag on the show. It's funny--in advance oftoday's discussion, I wanted to watch Episodes 2 and 3 again, but I couldn'tbring myself to do it: They bored me, and I realized that it was Tony's sisterwho bored me the most. Man, they should have killed off Livia when they had thechance, and that way they wouldn't have to saddle us with her drearydaughter.            Don't get wrong, I do enjoy the story lines that don't deal directly withpeople getting whacked, and I could watch Edie Falco, who plays Tony's wife,spend 10 hours reading the phone book. To herself. I could even watch her inthe execrable Oz , in which she plays a prison guard. (How could HBOsimultaneously make a show as good as The Sopranos and as bad asOz ?)            Here's the thing: Generally speaking, I like my mob movies straight-up male:I still don't understand what Diane Keaton is doing in The Godfather(not to mention Sofia Coppola in III ). I love Tony's crew, and I lovemob intrigue. But David Chase has made Tony's relationship with his wife sointeresting--and, at least in the first season, made Tony's relationship withhis mother so appalling--that I don't generally fall asleep when the Sopranowomen are on screen. (I know you think I'm some kind of misogynist now,yes?).            As for Melfi, I've always had mixed feelings about her. She is at the centerof the story, of course; without her, Tony would be unredeemed, and dead. MaybeI don't like the character because Lorraine Bracco is a bit of a stiff. I don'tknow. I'm a simple guy. I'd rather watch Silvo and Paulie Walnuts and Pussy andTony shoot pool and gripe and plot to kill people, and I'd rather watch Heshscheme and Christopher explode, than watch Lorraine Bracco act.            On the subject of Italian-Americans and their gripes about TheSopranos , et al., I'm with you (thought I must admit Merchant ofVenice ain't my all-time favorite. Who wrote that piece of shit, anyway?Your friend de Man?). I grew up in a Spike Lee movie: Italians needled theIrish who beat-up the Jews who harassed the blacks (well, not really) and soon. I like ethnic humor. Besides, I have a theory about America's fascinationwith Italian criminals: said fascination is merely an extension of the world'slove for everything Italian--culture, opera, food, art, architecture. It's allof a piece. At least, this is what I tell Italian-Americans who write meincredibly nasty letters when my mob stories appear.            By the way, since when do I have Hasidic friends? God, what do you think ofme?            Oh--A mook is kind of like a gavone, which is kind of like an Italianschmuck.            Jeff
