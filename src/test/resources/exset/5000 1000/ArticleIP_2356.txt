HerbertStein                        Perhaps because we arenearing the end of a millennium, there seems to be a renewal of interest intheories of history. We seek regularities in the long movements of history,trying to find our place in a bigger picture than the evening news and hopingto see what is coming next.            Three kinds of theories ofhistory have been prominent in recent discussion--ending theories, wavetheories, and cycle theories.            The ending theories identifyages with distinguishing features that have come to an end or will come to anend and will not recur. The distinguishing features may be dominance by onenation, the prevalence of a particular social system, or the pervasiveness of acertain technology. The Roman Empire came to an end, feudalism came to an end,and some say that the Industrial Age is coming to an end. These periods willnot come back. There may or may not be common features that bring ages to anend. There may or may not be a predictable sequence of ages, as in the Marxisttheory that feudalism leads to capitalism and capitalism leads to socialism--atheory that, so far, seems to have been erroneous.            The most ambitious of therecent ending theories is the theory of the end of history, advanced by FrancisFukuyama, a member of this week's panel.            Wave theories postulate therecurrence of phases with similar characteristics. Thus, History goes A-B, A-Bor A-B-C, A-B-C. All the As have similar features that distinguish them fromthe Bs or Cs. But the As may be of quite different lengths from each other, andso may the Bs and Cs, and they may have their distinguishing features todifferent degrees. A recent wave theory is that propounded by David HackettFisher. He finds in history long waves of inflation, each followed by a crisisfollowed by a period of equilibrium followed by another wave of inflation, andso on.            Cycle theories, unlike wavetheories, suggest that the phases of history are of roughly similar duration.That permits prediction of the remaining duration of the present phase and thecoming of the next phase. A simple historical cycle consists of alternatingphases of political activism followed by political passivity. ArthurSchlesinger Jr., a member of our panel, is the leading exponent of this idea,which was first put forward by his father.            A more complex cycle isdescribed by co-authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, two of our panelists.They visualize a four-phase cycle. These phases are 1) an era of strengtheninginstitutions, 2) an era of spiritual awakening, 3) an era of weakeninginstitutions, and 4) an era of crisis. The entire four-phase cycle is believedto last about 80 years.            Our panel to discuss thevalidity and implications of these and other theories of history will consistof the aforementioned Messrs. Fukuyama, Schlesinger, Strauss, and Howe; andProfessor George Modelski, of the University of Washington.
