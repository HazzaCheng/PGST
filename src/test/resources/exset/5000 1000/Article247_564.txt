                                 Pol Pot--Potted Pol?            The Washington Post leads with a new study indicating thatfalse positive mammogram results are quite common. This is also the topnational story at the Los Angeles Times (and is featured on the USA Todayfront and carried inside at the New YorkTimes ). USAT goes with word that the State Department hasdeclared twenty Russian agencies and research facilities ineligible formillions in U.S. government aid because they may have provided missiletechnology to Iran. The NYT lead is that Kofi Annan has decided to pullU.N. human rights investigators out of Congo (formerly Zaire) because of thenew government's harassment and obstruction of their work.            According to the study of the medical records of 2,400 women, the mostcomprehensive of its kind ever attempted, 32 percent of all American women whoundergo annual breast checkups for a decade can expect to get at least one false mammogram indication of a tumor. That's if someof the checkups are physical checks only--if all ten are mammograms, the oddsgo up to 50 percent. (Hence USAT 's alarmist-seeming, but dead-accurateheadline: "False-positive rate for mammography 50-50.") The researcherscalculate that ultimately unnecessary follow-up tests add 33 percent to thecost of breast cancer screening. Some doctors quoted in the Post saythat the threat of malpractice suits in the U.S. contributes to the problem, inthat it pressures radiologists to overdiagnose breast cancer.            By the way, the study appears in today's issue of the New England Journalof Medicine , a fact that the NYT leaves until the last sentence ofits AP version of the story. The WP waits until the 13th paragraph.What's that all about? The LAT and USAT put the provenancehigh.            The USAT lead is based on a State Department list, obtained by thepaper, of banned Russian organizations, from universities to intelligenceagencies. Since it was issued, the paper says, U.S. officials have actuallydenied funding to at least three Russian projects because their proposedrecipients were on the list. The move marks the first time specific Russianinstitutions have been penalized for suspected missile aid to Iran.            The WP reports that a cable-funded three-year study of television violencebilled as the largest ever concludes that "glamorized" violence--where physicaland mental consequences are not depicted, the kind considered most harmful toviewers--remains rampant, despite Industry promises to address the problem. ThePost says the American Medical Association reacted by commenting that"the study definitively confirms that TV portrays violence in a way thatincreases the risk of learning aggressive attitudes."            Both USAT and the LAT give front-page above-the-fold play tothe first major study of the Internet's economic impact,released Wednesday by the Commerce Department. The information is stunning: Nettraffic is doubling every hundred days. E-commerce should reach $300 billion by2002. The digital economy is growing at twice the rate of the overall economyand now represents 8 percent of GDP. While it took radio 30 years to reach 50million people, and TV took 13, the Internet did it in just four. (At thisrate, Slate might just break even while there are still papers for"Today's Papers" to be about.) Both papers mention that Net technology hasserved as a brake on inflation, but the LAT is clearer about why--thepaper relates that Hewlett-Packard has saved more than $200 million annually bylinking employees on an internal network and will shave 70 percent off itspaper costs via making personnel policies and payroll forms available online.The Wall Street Journal notes another Net businesstrend: Internet stockholder voting. Corporations that allow it include Bell andHowell, Atlantic Richfield and Intel.            The late metro edition of the NYT is able to state with someconfidence what the paper's earlier national edition was only able to treat asa rumor: "Pol Pot is Dead, Thai Army Says." But not everybody is convinced--thepaper quotes a Western diplomat's reference to the recently announced U.S.intention to bring Pot to international justice: "This is certainly aconvenient moment for him to have a heart attack."
