                                 Iraq Backs Down                           If you missed the mostrecent installments of this column, here they are: posted Friday, Nov.13, and Tuesday, Nov. 10.                        The Daily Star of Bangladeshpaints the Iraqi crisis as a pitiful Iraq against a ruthless aggressor in aneditorial Sunday, saying, " 'Defiance' of a despoiled countryresonates with a total back-to-the-wall desperation." The editorial calls forthe lifting of sanctions on Iraq, as does Dawn of Pakistan, which condemns the "genocidal U.N. sanctions inIraq." Saying that Iraq was until recently compliant with the U.N. SecurityCouncil weapons inspectors, Dawn denounces the bias of UNSCOM inspectorsand their insistence on thoroughly searching Iraq's presidential palaces.            TheBritish papers noted that Tony Blair backed Clinton to the hilt in the Iraqicrisis and said that "absolute and unconditional compliance" was necessary forIraq. In an editorial, the Times praised the strong, unified action of the British and theAmericans and said it was time to seize this opportunity while a large force isassembled in the Gulf and Iraq is apparently in retreat. The piece alsorecommended that with Britain and the United States now apparently in thedriver's seat, it is time to review the sanctions.            Anews item in the Prague Post says that Iran and Iraq are making trouble forCzech Republic authorities over the broadcast of Radio Free Europe and RadioLiberty into their countries. The controversial broadcasts, in the nativelanguages of Iraq and Iran, began Oct. 30. Since then, the Iranian governmenthas recalled its ambassador from Prague, and Iraq has warned that traderelations between the two countries could suffer. The Czech government hasbrushed off these claims.            The Israeli paper Ha'aretzsays if the United States had struck against Iraq, it would have spelleddisaster for President Clinton's visit to the Gaza Strip next month. Itspeculates that the Palestinians would have empathized with the Iraqis andsought to retaliate for the strikes--the Hamas, for example, might havelaunched an American-flag-burning fest.            Anotherop-ed in Ha'aretz called "The Saddam Index" complains thatthe United States did not formally warn Israel before withdrawing nonessentialdiplomats and cautioning Americans about travel to Israel in the days leadingup to the recent crisis. The United States thus scores very low on the Saddamindex, the guiding principle of which is "the longer the advance warning toIsrael, the greater the level of trust" between the United States and Israel.The editorial detects "symptoms of arteriosclerosis in relations betweenWashington and Jerusalem." This is further evident, the editorial says, in theway Clinton has brushed aside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sinceWye.            The Jerusalem Post carries a story titled "Arafat Warns: Our riflesare ready," portraying an angry Yasser Arafat defending the right ofPalestinians to pray in Jerusalem. Netanyahu responded by saying that Arafat'sstance "endangers the entire Oslo agreement and casts a very dark shadow overthe Wye agreement as well." This comes, the Post notes, at a time ofincreased cooperation between the two sides.            TheMiddle East Times of Egypthas a lead editorial railing against the portrayal of Arab-Americans in theAmerican movie The Siege . "With the exception of Haddad and amiserable-looking courier who gets caught as he tries to bring in cash for theterrorists, the Arabs here are either terrorists or non-persons who provide apoor-looking backdrop," it said.            An article in the Moscow Times reports that Russia isexporting grain even as it imports it. Russia has already exported 1.5 milliontons of wheat, even as humanitarian aid in the form of 2.5 tons of wheat pourinto Russia from Europe and the United States. The reason: It is three timesmore profitable to sell wheat abroad as to sell it in Russia. Wisely, theUnited States has stipulated that the imported aid grain not be re-exported forprofit. But as one analyst said, "You can't put a 'Made in the USA' brand onevery grain."            The South China Morning Post writesthat at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,the home government got very testy over visiting foreign officials'preoccupation with the arrest and trial of former Deputy Premier Anwar Ibrahim.The Post notes the deep disappointment in Malaysia over the no-show byPresident Clinton, who stayed home to cope with the Iraqi crisis and sent VicePresident Al Gore instead. Even U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wasprematurely summoned home from the summit.
