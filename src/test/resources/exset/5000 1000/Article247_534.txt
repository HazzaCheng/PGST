                                 Depo Charge                           USAToday , the New York Times ,and the Los Angeles Times lead with yesterday's unanimous SupremeCourt decision that the law barring sexual discrimination in the workplaceapplies equally to harassment between workers of the same sex. The Washington Post , which runs the Supreme Court story nearthe top, goes instead with the most detailed account yet of President Clinton'sdeposition in the Paula Jones case. "Today's Papers" couldn't help but noticethat President Clinton didn't comment on the important step the Supreme Courttook to keep the workplace safe from sexual harassment.            It's just common sense that same sex doesn't automatically mean noharassment, but the reporting on the decision makes it clear that thelegalities have been murky. According to the NYT , the law of sexual harassment is basically a recent SupremeCourt creation, and broadening its application has met with hostility in lowercourts. The NYT reports that Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion for theCourt--issued in the case of a male oil-rig worker complaining about histreatment by male co-workers--says the acid test for harassment is not the sexor motivation of the parties, but whether there is sex-based discrimination inthe workplace "so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of thevictim's employment."            Scalia, notes the Times , went on to claim that the decision does notabrogate all "genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and womenroutinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex," andall the papers give his example: a football coach slapping a player's rear onthe way to the field would be lawful, while the same gesture directed at thecoach's (female or male) secretary might not be. All the dailies note that thedecision drew praise from civil rights and gay rights advocates.            It's interesting to compare the harassment headlines. The NYT says,"High Court Widens Workplace Claims of Sex Harassment." This is much less clearthan USAT 's "Same-sex Harassment Illegal." (The LAT has virtuallythis same to-the-point headline.)            The Post runs its Clinton lead clear across the top. And once again, photoeditors in effect put an opinion on the front page. The accompanying picture ofClinton has to be the least attractive one of him ever published: Eyes hooded,JFK-style, talking out of one side of his mouth.            This story, about Clinton's January 17th deposition, represents the mostelaborate press account yet of his description of his relationship with MonicaLewinsky. Clinton testified, says the paper, that the two exchanged gifts andthat she visited him in his office perhaps five times, and that they may havebeen alone together. The president denied having sexual relations withLewinsky, which for the purposes of the deposition was defined as fondling andoral sex, but not kissing on the mouth. Clinton said it was his secretary BettyCurrie who initiated career help for Lewinsky.            In the deposition, Clinton denied that he propositioned Paula Jones and alsodenied having sex with three other women he was asked about. He did, however,say that he'd had sex with Gennifer Flowers--just once, in 1977.            The Post reports that often during the proceeding's five hours,Clinton had to be asked to speak up. And, says the paper, at a couple ofpoints, he reacted to something that was said in a "frustrated outburst." It'sodd that the WP was able to find this out without finding out whatprompted it.            The story gives a good picture of the personal degradation involved forClinton in giving the deposition: there were seventeen people in attendance.Obviously, at least one of them was the source for this story. Place your moneyon Paula Jones and/or one of her six (!) lawyers.                           USAT , the LAT , and the NYT all go front page with thenews that choke-out thug Latrell Sprewell was given his gazilliondollar contract back by an arbitrator. Everybody has this quote from NBAcommissioner David Stern: "You cannot strike your boss and still hold yourjob--unless you play in the NBA...."            The WP reports that, voting along racial lines, the Mississippi stateSenate yesterday rejected a proposal to compensate relatives of those killed inthe state in hate crimes during the civil rights era. Sen. Richard White isquoted as saying, "I don't think we need to....start scratching thesesores."            Michael Kelly's WP column about Ken Starr vs. SidneyBlumenthal has one of the more striking author disclaimers you'll ever see:"....(full disclosure: I worked with Blumenthal at the New Yorker anddidn't like him.)"
