                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        To the chagrin of many and the joy of at least a few, Cocktail Chatterreturns after a two-week absence, which God knows I hope made your hearts growfonder. Not coincidentally, perhaps, the two weekly recaps that went unwrittenwould have had to detail a stock market tumbling steadily downhill, a Netsector in which investors appeared to have lost all faith, and interest ratesthat had reached a two-year high. (Though it's always worth remembering that6.25 percent is not exactly usurious.) This week, things brightened slightly,for no obvious reason aside from excellent earnings from bellwethers Cisco (aholding of mine) and Wal-Mart (which I don't own but probably should) and ageneral sense that the market was "oversold."            "Oversold" doesn't mean anything, of course. It just means that prices havedropped pretty far pretty quickly. Unfortunately, sometimes prices drop far andquickly for good reasons. This wasn't one of those times, I think, but"oversold" is not a label that helps you tell the difference. But it's a goodword to use at cocktail parties if you want everyone to know you're in theknow. Actually, it's a good word to use if you want people to think you're acrackpot. But that can be fun, too. And so, once more into the breach.            1. "This from Bloomberg News: 'Microsoft Corp. said AvantGo Inc., whichdelivers customized information to handheld computers, will offerMicrosoft's Slate online magazine in a bid to widen distribution ofthe highbrow Web publication ...

Microsoft, which is based in Redmond,Washington, fell 1 5/16 to 83 13/16.' Next we'll be blamed for the fact thatPaul Allen is selling two million Microsoft shares ."            2. "Southwest Airlines president Herb Kelleher announced that he would beundergoing treatment for prostate cancer , and commentators praised hisopenness as evidence that companies were no longer as quick to hide potentialproblems from investors. Gerald Meyers, the former chairman of AMC, told theNew York Times , 'It's like erectile dysfunction . Who would talkabout that six months ago?' ... So CEOs are now going to tell us when they'reerectilely dysfunctional? Can we pass on that?"            3. "General American Life Insurance said that it would be unable toredeem billions of dollars of withdrawals from investors who had enteredinto so-called 'short-term funding agreements' with the company. Althoughcredit-ratings agencies had always frowned on these agreements , GeneralAmerican always claimed they were a good business to be in. Oh yeah. It's agreat business when you can borrow money with no intention of paying itback."            4. "The Wall Street Journal reports, as evidence of tight labormarkets , that roofing contractor Jude Laperouse, of Houma, Louisiana, hasto turn down jobs because he can't find enough workers, despite offering astarting wage of $6 an hour . Damn! He can't get people to work tarring aroof for $6 an hour? What the hell is wrong with people! How spoiled have webecome?!"            5. "Perennial also-ran Advanced Micro Devices, which practically every yearcomes out with a new product that it says will challenge Intel'sdomination of the microprocessor market and practically every year has anew explanation for why the previous year's product failed, released the Athlonchip this week. It's faster and more powerful than the Pentium III ,yadda yadda yadda. You gotta wonder if the PR firm that wrote the press releasetouting Athlon wasn't tempted to add: 'No, really. This time we mean it.'"            6. "McDonald's is introducing self-serve kiosks in certain testlocations. Someone tell me again: Why did the Automats go out of business?"            7. "Blockbuster Video went public yesterday, and saw its shares budge notat all from their offering price . The headline in Variety ? 'FirstDay of Trading Hardly a Blockbuster.' It's genius, I tell you!
