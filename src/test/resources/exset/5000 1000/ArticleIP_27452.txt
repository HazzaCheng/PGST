"We will see how they will feelafter a few more weeks and months or what have you of continuously poundingthem into pieces." However, he adds, "We may have one flaw in our thinking."What?                                     Sendyour answer by noon ET Thursday to newsquiz@slate.com .                           Tuesday's Question(No. 236)--"Tragedy Plus Time Minus Taste":                                       Columbine students resumed classes Monday at nearby Chatfield HighSchool. Many wore white T-shirts imprinted on the front with "We Are..." and onthe back ... what?                        "...Guaranteed straight A's."-- Stuart Wade and Brooke Saucier                        "...Famous."-- Matt Sullivan and Charles Star ( Lynn Rosetta ,Lori Hoffman , and Greg Diamond had similar answers.)            "...Suing."-- Greg Diamond                        "...Not riding the bus for fear of a NATO misfire."-- Michael Holloway(similarly, David Ballard )            "Hmm... that's odd.

Randy'sWrap-Up                        Some participants, confused by the question,replied with slogans for both the front and back of the Littleton T-shirt. Iblame the ambiguous use of ellipses. And those damn video games. Violentmovies. The estrangement of too many parents from John McCain's life. (Have anyof you phoned him today?) Our failure to embrace a lackluster technical fixfrom Al Gore and his Web cronies. The absence of Orrin Hatch praying in thenation's schools. (Isn't there some high-tech way to fly him from class toclass, perhaps on Boeing's new Delta III rocket; you know, once it stopsmalfunctioning.) I'll tell you who I don't blame, the NRA. Or myself. OK, I doblame myself. I should simply have asked: "What did it say on the back?"Sorry.            Displeasing in contentas well as in form, today's question garnered a record number of responsesscorning the heartlessness of News Quiz. It also garnered a record number ofresponses, or if not a record, certainly a lot. So, presumably participantswere not as offended as they claimed to be. When Boswell expressed enormoussympathy for the victims of an earthquake, Johnson took him to task for hisshowing deep feeling, saying he doubted that Boswell had even missed a meal.Johnson disdained exaggeration. If anyone wants to discuss this further, I'llbe at Chuck Heston's house hacking around on his Playstation and giving him alittle talking to. Of course it's his fault.                           A 100 PercentCotton Answer                        The front of theT-shirts says, "We are ..." and the back says, "Columbine." Chatfield,Columbine's traditional rival, welcomed their guests with banners and signsincluding, "We Are One," featuring Columbine's colors, blue and white, andChatfield's colors, maroon and white, entwined in a heart.
