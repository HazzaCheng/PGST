                                 <i>The Sopranos</i>: TV's Only High Note                        Tucker:            The Times thing sounds reprehensible--I agree. If, I don't know, BobHerbert sent around a mass e-mail with dirty jokes about the wives of Texasexecutioners, do you think he'd get fired?            I want to move away from all this witty banter about politics and mediaethics and move on to something more serious: TV. I noticed in several paperstoday that HBO plans to rerun all 13 episodes of The Sopranos startingthe day after Christmas (a holiday that Nancy Marchand's character, LiviaSoprano, would no doubt say is a racket for the non-Jews). I don't know aboutyou, but I love television. Some people have sports; other people havepolitics. I have digital cable: 500 channels of bliss. Watching TheSopranos last spring was like gazing at a Rothko or eating at Chez Panisse.It was art, pure and simple, and it was immensely nourishing--and if you don'tbelieve me, ask the half-dozen or so guys I play poker with every week. They'renot your average beer-bellied slackers (well, only one is), and they're notalpha-wave-overdosed geeks. They're sophisticates, and to a one they savoredevery episode, every frame, every line. It's all we talked about then, andagain all we talked about when the series was rerun for the first time over thesummer. What makes it so good? All the usual things: wonderful writing, greatcasting (the co-casting director is Christopher Walken's wife), and a verycontemporary story line that has already been copied to ill effect by othermovies and TV shows. What The X-Files was a few years ago and AllyMcBeal was last year, The Sopranos is this year: A masterpiecefraudulently imitated by lesser men--the sort who wouldn't be let into the BadaBing Club. (Don't ask.)            One reason I think The Sopranos is so far superior to everything elseon the tube is that everything else on the tube is dreadful. Even The WestWing , a shabby small-screen version of every big-screen movie about theinner workings of government (which are themselves shabby versions of the realthing, which is itself a shabby version of what the real thing should be), is ahit; it ought to be canceled, if only to send a message to the dentist whocapped Martin Sheen's teeth. Only a little while ago, it seems, everyone wasmarveling at how TV had eclipsed the movies in terms of quality, which led toan exodus of film folks for the friendlier confines of the blue glow. Thisseason, I think, the tide has turned back. It's been a banner year for themovies, at least in my opinion. I really liked American Beauty , ThreeKings , The Sixth Sense , The Blair Witch Project , and BeingJohn Malkovich , to name but five of the very solid flicks that lived up toand even exceeded my expectations in the past few months. Whereas, except forThe Simpsons and The Practice, there are no TV shows worthwatching regularly anymore. This is probably the reason for the rise of themagazine shows on VH-1, E!, and the like. Not that I need to rationalize theexistence of Behind the Music . The minute I saw Leif Garrett in hisbandanna hopefully talking about a comeback in 2000, I was hooked. He had me athello.            Tucker, you have little kids, right? I have a 3-year-old, and she is muchmore optimistic about the future of television than I am. Not a day goes bywhen she doesn't ask to watch Arthur or the new hip Zoom , whosecast is as diverse ethnically and, for all I know, in its sexual orientation asthe first Clinton cabinet. Lately, though, our favorite--hers and mine--is theanimated series based on the George and Martha books. The main characters aretwo hippos, friends rather than lovers, and I've always suspected that Georgeis gay--the first homosexual lead, as it were, in children's entertainment.(I'm not counting Professor Brown in Bednobs and Broomsticks . The Britsare simply effete.) And, wouldn't you know, I'm right. Nathan Lane does thevoice of George with such flamboyance and relish that it puts the actors onWill and Grace to shame.            What's Will and Grace ? Uhh, maybe we should go back to talking aboutpolitics.            Regards,Evan
