                                 The Future Ain't What It Used To Be                        Dear Dad,            For as long as I can remember, more than 25 years, reporters have beenasking you to make predictions about the future. And you have always given ananswer along the lines of what you told the ABC producer yesterday. It'sconvincing, and sober, and intellectually responsible, and it frustrates themto no end. Just once, perhaps, you should give them what they want. "Watch forthe invention of flying cars in 2006, which will drastically affect the courseof World War III when it breaks out in 2008. There'll be a Mars colony by 2020.And by the way, make sure to sell all your Xerox stock by next Wednesday."            More seriously, I have one question for you about all of this, and onedemurral. The question concerns patterns of technological change. As a lot ofcommentators have been noting recently, the future isn't what it used to be.When I was a kid, visions of the future were heavy on, yes, flying cars andMars colonies and the like. Everyone was confidently predicting that by theyear 2000 the human race would be well on its way to settling the solar system,while at home we'd be casually buzzing from continent to continent in our cars,and the robot servants took care of cleaning the house.            These seemed reasonable enough predictions, actually, given the pace ofchange up till then in the 20 th century. It's hard to believe thatin just 66 years, less than a lifetime, we went from Wilbur and Orville Wrighton the beach at Kitty Hawk to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon. 66years! If that pace of change had continued, I would probably have been sendingyou this e-mail from Jupiter orbit. But it didn't continue. In fact, it's hardnot to think that in a lot of areas, technological change has slowed to acrawl, with incremental improvements around the edges, but no great leapsforward. We are 30 years past Apollo 11, and have gone from a Moon landing to... the space shuttle. Thirty years ago we were flying on 747s, and now we areflying on ... literally the same airplanes. In the United States, at least,transport by car and train is mostly slower than it was then (trains are onearea in which the French have beaten us hands down--if we had their high-speedTGV train, you could come down from Boston to see your grandchildren inWashington with a two-hour train ride, instead of the seven-plus Amtrakcurrently takes). The same is true of other sectors: generation of energy(where we've stepped back from nuclear power), and even, with the exception ofcomputer-guided bombs and the like, weaponry. Where are the stun pistols andblast rays we were supposed to be using by the year 2000? (The NRA has missedout on a great slogan here. "Personal blast rays don't destroy whole cityblocks. People destroy whole city blocks.")            But on the other hand, obviously, some technological sectors have beenholding to the same, incredible pace of change that aeronautics went throughearlier: information technology and biotechnology, first and foremost. Why isthis? And how does it relate to the broader structural changes in the economythat you talked about in your message?            Here's my demurral. Is there really such a thing as "primordial identities,"in the way you suggest? This is certainly what the present-day nationalistswould like us to think. They would like us to imagine that for 40 years, everySerbian mother put her children to bed whispering, "We must put up with thisregime for now. But someday, someday, Serbia will awake!" I'm sure some of themwere doing exactly that, but lots of others adjusted just fine to the communistregime. It was only when the regime collapsed that certain people saw anadvantage for themselves in highlighting ethnic and linguistic differences, andin, not so much resurrecting eternal, unchanging, primordial identities so muchas creating new identities based on the old myths and loyalties. And I thinkthey would probably abandon these new identities easily enough if it suitedthem. If the people of Serbia could vote freely and had the choice betweenpossession of Kosovo and membership in the European Union, which do you thinkthey would choose?
