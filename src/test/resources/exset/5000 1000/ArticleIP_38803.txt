                                 More <EM>Merde</EM>            TheMad Cow War between Britain and France is still the most interesting subject inthe international press. It has brought out a Francophobia in the Britishnewspapers that has to be read to be believed. The Times of London, once abyword for dignity, has a regular feature called "Centre of Attention" aboutthe hot topic of the day. Wednesday's column, devoted to French food, plumbednew depths of vulgarity. Beside a photograph of a French cow, the paper printedthe words: "Pity la                pauvre vache . Less succulent than herBritish sister, she's been good only for cheese. Now we find she has been fedthe bodily by-products of Europe's least soap-conscious nation. Leaving her astasty as a draught from a mud-wrestler's jockstrap."            Despite French denials that their cows are fed on human excrement--"No cow inthe world would eat sewage," a French agriculture official protested Tuesday tothe Independent of London--this is the aspect of the dispute thathas captured the imagination of the British press. The symbol of the DailyMail 's campaign for a British consumers' boycott of French food is adrawing of a cow with a beret on its head and a roll of toilet paper hanging ona chain from its neck. "England expects every shopper to do their duty," thepaper proclaimed Wednesday on its front page--evoking Adm. Horatio Nelson'ssignal to the British fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, "England expects thatevery man will do his duty"--but also reflecting the decline in grammaticalstandards in England over the past 200 years. (Another Nelson exhortation tohis sailors--"You must hate a Frenchman as you hate the devil"--was not quotedanywhere, but was being widely followed in the spirit.)            TheDaily Mail 's front-page headline, above a picture of French farmershalting British trucks with burning barricades at the Channel port of Calais,was "Merde ! What a flaming cheek," and inside in an editorial it said,"A million scientists proclaiming that beef from excrement-fed cattle is safewill only reinforce the commonsense view that animals fed in such a disgustingway cannot possibly be healthy." So much for scientists. The Mail alsoquoted a French farmers' leader as saying, "England is an island--it is easierto blockade than the Continent." He was presumably unaware of a famous prewarheadline in the Times : "Fog in Channel: Continent isolated."            TheTimes headed its anti-French editorial Wednesday with the kind of drearyplay on words that Fleet Street currently finds irresistible. "A reasonablebeef," it said, "The French should eat their words." The conservative DailyTelegraph saidin an editorial: "If French farmers really think they can forceBritish consumers to buy their produce by blockading Calais, they had betterprepare for a long and unprofitable winter on the quayside. ... [T]rying toannoy your target market lacks the flair and subtlety for which the Frenchtraditionally pride themselves." It also noted that the French national rugbyteam, currently in England for that sport's World Cup, had ordered a meal ofroast beef from room service at their hotel in Windsor with "absolutely nostipulations as to where it came from." The paper wished the French team "allthe best" in its semifinal on Sunday.            Themass-circulation Sun , now reportedly dumping its famous Page-3 bare-breastedpinups at the request of Rupert Murdoch's new Chinese wife, used the smallFrench farmers' protest at Calais as the excuse for an attack on Prime MinisterTony Blair for his pro-Europeanism. "Is THIS what it means to be at the heartof Europe, Mr Blair?" it asked, beside a photograph of the burning barricade."Come on, Mr Blair," it said in an editorial. "Start kicking backsides in Parisand Brussels."            The French press, bycontrast, was rather restrained. Le Monde Wednesday even seemed to support the idea of aunilateral British ban on French food imports. It said Blair had the scientificjustification for such a gesture and that if he had decided to make it (whichhe didn't), it "would without doubt have had the merit of calming the enormousstorm of Francophobia that is consuming the British Isles at the moment." LeMonde separately reported that, according to European officials, the UnitedStates is expected to lift its ban on imports of French Roquefort cheese, ptde foie gras, and mustards at the World Trade Organization conference inSeattle at the end of next month.
