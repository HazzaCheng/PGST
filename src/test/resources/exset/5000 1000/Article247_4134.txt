                                 How 'Bout That Yahoo!?                        On a day when the Nasdaq reached yet another all-time high, the mostastounding move was made by Yahoo, which leapt 24 percent, adding more than $17billion to its market capitalization. Yahoo is joining the S&P 500 tomorrow(making it only the second Internet company, after AOL, to do so), and in theweek since its addition to the index was announced its share price has risenalmost 150 points.            The situation, at least today, boiled down to too much demand chasing toolittle supply. Index funds, which track the S&P directly, had to buy sharesof Yahoo in proportion to its market cap, since the S&P is market-capweighted. And since there are plenty of mutual fund managers out there who tryto mimic the S&P--while charging significantly more in fees than an indexfund--there was other institutional money chasing Yahoo as well. And as thecompany's shares became more expensive, funds had to buy more of them (becauseof the market-cap weighting). The result was a virtuous circle for sellers anda truly vicious one for buyers.            Still, the picture seems a bit more complicated than this, because theaverage trade in Yahoo today was just 503 shares. Needless to say, mostinstitutions are not buying stock in 500-share lots, so that means that a greatdeal of the action today was driven by individual investors and, most likely,day traders hoping to ride the stock's momentum and to get out before theeventual fall. Today was, in that sense, a moment when this decade's crucialstock-market trends--indexing, momentum investing, individual investing, andthe Internet--converged to make Yahoo investors very happy indeed.            It's almost certain that the stock will fall in days to come, but its rideup has been so furious, and the company is such a good one, that it would besurprising if the tumble were too precipitous. In any case, the most importantthing about Yahoo's addition to the S&P is not the effect on its stockprice. Instead, it's the way that addition drives home an often-overlooked butnonetheless crucial fact about the S&P 500, that it is as actively managedas any mutual fund.            This point was first made, as far as I can tell, by Bill Miller, thebrilliant fund manager of Legg Mason Value Trust, in a letter to his investorsearlier this year. Index funds, Miller pointed out, are passively managed,which is to say that they simply duplicate the S&P 500 in order toreplicate the performance of the "market." But the S&P 500 itself is addedto and subtracted from in an attempt to make the index look as much like thestock market, and the economy as a whole, as possible.            If this is the case, why is it so difficult for fund managers to beat indexfunds based on the S&P? There seem to be two reasons. The first, and mostobvious, is that index funds have minuscule fees and very low transactioncosts. The second, though, is that the fact that the S&P is weighted bymarket capitalization means that it manages money--and thereforeinvestments--in almost a textbook fashion. As companies grow more successful,and more expensive, they take up a larger percentage of the index, and as theygrow less successful, and cheaper, they take up a smaller percentage. In otherwords, the index effectively allows its winners to run and its losers todwindle.            You'll often hear fund managers say it's unfair to benchmark them againstthe S&P because it does things like add Yahoo and take out Laidlaw (thecompany that will be booted tomorrow). Assuming that Yahoo, even with itsrecent run-up, will do better over the next five years than Laidlaw, then theS&P will do better than it would otherwise have done. (Significantlybetter, in fact, given the size of Yahoo's market capitalization.) But theS&P's approach to investing--add dominant companies the market has alreadyrewarded--and to money management is easily replicable. It's a measure of howaddicted to trading fund managers have become that instead of replicating thatapproach, they prefer to complain about it.
