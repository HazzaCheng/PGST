                                 The Media's Substance Problem            QUEENS, N.Y.--George Bush began his visit to New York City yesterday with astop at a charter school in Harlem. Afterward, he gave an eloquent speech inwhich he unveiled a second major education policy initiative dealing withcharter schools, reorganizing federal education programs, and a proposal thatvaguely resembles national testing for third- through eighth-graders. TodayBush appeared with Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at a citywelfare-office-turned-job-center. People stood up and gave moving testimonyabout how the center and ones like it steer people away from welfare and intowork.            After everyone spoke, Bush held a press conference, his only one of thetrip. Here is what reporters asked:            Q: Gov. Bush, some conservative Republicans have said that your criticismlast week and again yesterday is undermining their credibility on Capitol Hill.Have you made a political calculation that you can afford to alienate the rightwing if that means courting more moderate voters?            Q: Gov. Bush, there are many New Yorkers who perceive that Pat Buchanan isanti-Semitic, anti-black, and anti-immigrant. Should he be read out of theRepublican Party?            Q: Is there room in the big tent for bigotry?            Q: Gov. Bush, Gov. Pataki and Mayor Giuliani have both decried racism andanti-Semitism. ... Your Louisiana campaign chair purchased mailing lists fromDavid Duke. When you were asked about that, you said you didn't even knowanything about it ...            Q: Governor, you talked earlier about the Republican Party and the image ofthe party. There have been four national elections this decade. Could you justtalk about each one and talk about how you think that's caused the party'simage to go off track and how that informs what you're trying to do now?            Q. You say the party's been mischaracterized. ... But last week there was anactual thing they were doing that was not mischaracterized [i.e., attempting todelay payments under the Earned Income Tax Credit]. It was an actualpolicy.            Q. You said several months ago that you would not campaign against thisRepublican Congress. But some people hear what you said over the last week asprecisely that.            Bush was asked no questions about education and only one about welfare. Thisconcerned a federal investigation into whether Giuliani was "improperly denyingbenefits for some recipients." In other words, the questions he got fromreporters focused on politics and positioning to the total exclusion of hisactual policies and positions. Reporters tried to provoke Bush into making newsor embarrassing his hosts, while ignoring the social policy issues on hisagenda.            It's not that the questions they asked weren't interesting or legitimate(though most did fall under the category of "already asked and answered"). I'veheard far worse at other press conferences dominated by local TV loudmouthsasking endless stentorian variations on the essential horse-race query "Who'sgoing to win?" And a focus on pure politics is surely better than a focus onpersonal misbehavior or the issue of whether evangelical Christians should bealone with women not their wives. But why can't reporters devote at least someof their time and intelligence to actual issues?            I can think of a few reasons for the allergy to substance. The first is theimperative for daily reporters to move the ball on an ongoing story, such asBush vs. Buchanan or Bush vs. the congressional Republicans. Advancing such aconflict automatically counts as news. Some new detail about Bush's educationpolicy, by contrast, might or might not make the paper. A second factor is thejournalistic culture of the news conference, which rewards zinger questionsthat provoke news--and discourages anything that courts televised dullness. Athird factor is the newsroom division between politics and policy. Mostreporters covering the campaign are well schooled in the former and onlyminimally, if at all, knowledgeable about the latter. They may understand thepolitics of school choice or welfare reform, but tend to be far shakier on thesubstance.            The chief complaint of reformers these days is that the power ofspecial-interest money is breeding public cynicism about the political process.Horse-race journalism has more or less the same effect. It tells the publicthat all politicians ever do is quarrel--without doing much to elucidate what,if anything, they might be fighting about.
