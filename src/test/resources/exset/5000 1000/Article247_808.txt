                                 No Chinese Checkers            Both the New York Timesand the Los Angeles Times lead with yesterday's revelation that aspecial House committee's secret report concludes that over the past twodecades American companies have transferred significant amounts of militarytechnology to China, thereby damaging U.S. national security. This story isalso the off-lead at the Washington Post , which leads instead with Sen. Trent Lott'sproposed plan for a streamlined and quick impeachment trial, and at USA Today ,which leads instead with polling showing an easing of Americans' fears aboutY2K. Despite any general Y2K calming, a Wall Street Journal front-pager notes a dawning realizationamong technology workers: come next New Year's Eve, many of them will be not atparties, but at work monitoring their computers' Y2K performance.            The NYT , LAT and WP note that the China report was unusually bipartisan, receiving unanimouscommittee approval and finding Chinese acquisition of military secretstranspiring during Republican and Democratic administrations alike. TheWP sees in the findings a criticism of the Clinton administration policyof loosening export restrictions, which, according to the papers, the committeewants re-cinched. But the WSJ points out that the pot-and-kettle aspectof the findings may help deflect criticism of Bill Clinton. The congressionalreport, prompted by a NYT story last spring describing the unsupervisedflow of sensitive satellite technology to China's strategic rocket programs,confirmed that transfer, but, say the papers, went much further, alsouncovering the theft by the Chinese of nuclear weapons design technology fromAmerican labs and examining the too-loose export controls governing advancedcomputers. Also included was a look at the covert donations to Americanpolitical campaigns made during the 1996 election by a Chinese aerospaceexecutive. The papers draw their information from remarks made by the committeechairman, Rep. Chris Cox, but, says the NYT , it's unclear exactly howmuch more the general public will ever be allowed to learn about thecommittee's findings.            It's been known for a few days that Sen. Lott favored a streamlined trial for Clinton, but what's new today aresome of his details. According to the WP , the proposal would have theSenate voting by the fourth day of the trial about whether or not the allegedoffenses, even if proven, would count as high crimes and misdemeanors. If thatproposition didn't get a two-thirds majority, then the Senate would move on toconsider censure. The paper says leading House impeachment manager Henry Hydeexpressed "major concerns" about Lott's plan to the senator yesterday--mainlythat it doesn't provide for the calling of witnesses.            The NYT succinctly explains why the Lott plan is gaining ground inthe Senate: it gives the Senate an opportunity to avoid a long trial, while atthe same time affording senators some kind of vote on Clinton'simpeachment.            For a second straight day, Iraq anti-aircraft fire drew a tough U.S.response. This time, after a British plane was shot at, American warplanes hitthe three ground targets implicated with missiles and smart bombs. As it didthe day before, yesterday Iraq again claimed to have shot down a U.S. plane.The papers all note that the U.S. denies this, but none observes that Iraqhasn't done something that countries who have shot down planes have done sincethe Red Baron got bagged--produced wreckage. If Hussein's goal is not so muchto shoot down a U.S. plane as to keep the no-fly zones in the news, hisstrategy may be self-defeating: The LAT puts the story above the fold,but repetition is driving it inside elsewhere--page 12 at USAT , page 29at the Post .            The WP finds front-page space today for what you might call theY2K problem for classicists--there is no agreed-upon way towrite out 1999 in Roman numerals. Who cares? Well, explains, the paper, thereare the architects (How to mark the cornerstones of buildings?), and the movieproducers (How to write the copyright date at the end of the credits?). ThankGod the government's National Institute of Standards and Technology is workingon this.            The WP 's Richard Cohen makes the point that the rescue of thoseballoonists is rich-dude welfare. How much welfare? Well, Cohen asked the CoastGuard to run the numbers and learned that rescuing Richard Branson and companycost taxpayers $130,275. And, he adds, under the law the Coast Guard cannoteven send Branson a bill. Today's Papers says hooray for Cohen and is stillamazed that news stories don't routinely do this kind of math. For instance, TPis still waiting for a news story that states the cost so far of the Houstonoctuplets.
