CocktailCatholicism                        In"Toward theWet Martini," Fareed Zakaria writes:            Buuel makes two commonerrors. First, he gets the Immaculate Conception wrong, which refers to theconception not of Jesus but of his mother, Mary--it's the Virgin Mary's mother,St. Anne, whose hymen is invisibly pierced by the Holy Ghost.            I imagine(indeed, I hope) that I am one of dozens who point out that Zakaria is alsowrong. Buuel--born Catholic, even if he opted out later--confused theIncarnation, in which the Holy Ghost caused Mary to conceive Jesus, and theImmaculate Conception, which refers to the fact (or belief, if you will) thatMary was born without original sin, although otherwise by the normal biologicalprocess.            -- Robert M.Johnson                                                         Note from theeditors: Fareed Zakaria is indeed wrong; he's even willing to admit it. Ifonly we here at Slate would let him! Zakaria realized his error beforepublication and tried to amend his copy, but his editors failed to make thechange in time (though we have now rectified our slip). Slate thanks thedozens (yes, there were dozens) of readers who pointed out the mistake, as wellas the nuns, priests, and lay theologians who gave them such excellent Catholiceducations.                                       Brandy,Capitalist                        In "Today'sPapers," Scott Shuger points out that Moesha ranked 124 thof 139 shows but was nonetheless renewed for another season--yet anotherinstance of the relentless creep of affirmative action. Might I suggest anotherexplanation?            In a                   Slate               article ("EqualOpportunism") just before Moesha 's premiere, I reported thatAfrican-American viewing patterns bear almost no resemblance to those of othergroups. ER was No. 1 for nonblacks, No. 20 for blacks. New YorkUndercover was No. 1 for blacks but not even in the top 20 for nonblacks.Only Monday Night Football was in both groups' top 10. A capitalist, ofwhom there are one or two among us, I hear tell, might bear this in mind whentargeting malt liquor, fast food, and sneaker commercials.            I have yetto obtain viewership figures for Moesha , but I suspect the show will bein the top three among blacks. Brandy is the sweetheart of black America--she'sWhitney Houston before Bobby Brown. Isn't it a little self-pitying to ascribemisplaced guilty liberalism and soggy altruism to the same folks who bring usseason after season of formulaic sitcoms, spandexed soap operas, anddisease-of-the-week movies? Where's the social purpose in that--affirmativeaction for lousy actors and worse writers (most of whom, it must be noted, arewhite)? It might just be that Moesha is about advertising dollars andnot about oppressing the beleaguered white man. Just a thought.            -- DebraDickerson Washington                           TheFuture of Futurology                        Thank youfor such a perceptive essay ("The RoadBehind,") by Michael Lewis. It astonishes me that so many of the brightpeople in Silicon Valley are capable of understanding things like quantumtunneling and Boolean algebra but are incapable of understanding history or thefuture. Forty years ago Arthur C. Clarke wrote a book imagining the future. Hisspecific predictions were pretty good, but his most insightful observation wasabout the business of futurology and the reason people usually can't see thefuture clearly. Clarke pointed out that we usually overestimate the amount ofchange that will happen in the short term and underestimate how much changewill happen in the long term. Our own achievements seem to loom so large thatwe can't imagine what our grandchildren might achieve. Silicon Valley is theclearest possible demonstration of Clarke's theorem. It sometimes seems thatworking at 1,000 megahertz precludes one from having much long-term memory.            -- Jim Quinn NorthCanton, Ohio                           Addressyour e-mail to the editors to letters@slate.com.
