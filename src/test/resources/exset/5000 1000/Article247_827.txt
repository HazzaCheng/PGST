                                 Saigon, Flanders, the Magna Carta, and Henry Hyde            All three papers--the Washington Post , the Los AngelesTimes , and the New YorkTimes --lead with the hyperbolic rhetoric of the House prosecutors asthey closed their argument on day three of the Senate impeachment trial. TheHouse Saturday rammed home its point that Clinton's alleged lying meets thestandard of "high crimes and misdemeanors" and is not the sex-sulliedtriviality that the Clinton defense team contends. The Senate (and the papers)give high marks to Rep. Lindsey Graham, who made the pertinent point thatperjury has dethroned judges in past impeachment trials. Rep. Henry "HotshotHistorian" Hyde wrapped up the day with grandiose allusions to our forefathers.Hyde intoned, "If we [view Clinton as above the law], we break faith with ourancestors from Bunker Hill, Lexington and Concord to Flanders fields, Normandy,Iwo Jima, Panmunjon, Saigon, and Desert Storm." Separately he invoked the MagnaCarta, the Ten Commandments, Roman Law, the Gettysburg Address, and the Spiritof '76.            The NYT front page analysis spotlights the (predictable) shatteringof the bipartisanship illusion, a theme that resonates throughout today'scoverage. The partisan rancor was symbolically illustrated Saturday when SenateMajority Leader Trent Lott penned a letter to Minority Leader Tom Daschleproposing the formation of a bipartisan group to map out potential witnesses.Daschle icily rejected the idea as premature.            The reigning consensus after day three is that the House did a surprisinglygood job, and the burden now shifts to the Clinton defense team to forestallwitnesses. The Clintonites will have to improve on their vague snipes of thelast three days; Saturday Clinton lawyers railed against the House and invokedthe the "interests of the American people" refrain.            An illuminating piece inside the WP article reports that foreign countries are jumping on the lucrative anti-tobaccobandwagon and suing U.S. tobacco companies--in U.S. courts. Guatemala,Nicaragua, and Panama have in recent months filed what Philip Morrisjustifiably calls "copycat lawsuits" to recover government-paid health carecosts and other damages. The legal merit of such claims by foreign countries inU.S. courts is shaky, legal analysts say.            The LAT "Sunday Report" says that the federal government's largesteducation grant program ($118 billion over three decades) has bombed. Theprogram, called Title 1, was meant to zap the gap between rich and poorstudents but has achieved minimal discernible progress. The reasons? The moneyis spread too thin, and too much of it goes to hire tutors and part-timeteachers ("paraprofessionals") rather than full-time certified teachers.            The 15 ethnic-Albanian "rebels" allegedly shot Friday in Kosovo by Serbianforces turned out to be 45 massacred civilians, many of whose mutilated bodies werediscarded in a mass grave. The story, coupled with gruesome photos, runs on allfronts. The papers conclude that this could sound the death knell for thedisintegrating peace agreement.            The WP reports inside that Richard Holbrooke may soon--finally--be nominated as the U.S.ambassador to the U.N. Sources say that Holbrooke has almost cleared thefinancial disclosure investigation that has delayed his nomination. ThePost notes that the U.S.-U.N. tiff over Iraq has made it a particularlyprecarious time for the ambassadorial seat to be empty.            A squib inside the NYT "Week in Review" promisingly entitled "Burping Cows and Space Toilets. Beam Me Up, Mr. Speaker!"doesn't disappoint. The piece contains choice excerpts from Rep. JamesTraficant Jr.'s occasional one-minute morning harangues on the House floor.(Quite often he concludes with "beam me up," a rhetorical plea to the StarshipEnterprise.) Here's the space toilets classic:            "Mr. Speaker, space. The final frontier. The search for new life, newcivilizations and now new toilets. That is right: NASA has a $30 million spacetoilet. You strap yourself in and 12 high-pressure air jets aid your relief ...Mr. Speaker, I say [it] is time to call out the Roto-Rooter man ... Beam me up,Scottie, nature is calling."
