                                 Run of the Millennium Stories            The LosAngeles Times and New York Times lead with (and theWall Street Journal tops its front-page world-widenews box with) yesterday's wide-ranging law enforcement action on the trail ofthe Algerian terrorist group implicated in that bomb-smuggling arrest inWashington state two weeks ago, action that netted a number of arrests indifferent cities, including one of an Algerian living in Brooklyn who hadrecently traveled to Seattle. Both papers report in addition that the feds aresaying that the Canadian woman recently arrested trying to come into Vermontand the man caught in Seattle are both associates of a known Algerianterrorist. The Washington Post off-leads the story, going instead withWashington, D.C.'s final preparations for its giant millennial celebration.USAToday , which through the miracle of extended newsstand dating becomesthe first U.S. daily newspaper to appear with a 2000 time-hack, gives its frontover to an essay, "The Next Century," which spends most of its time reviewingthis one, predictably arcing over the likes of McCarthyism, Martin Luther King,and Dylan but then swerving into the writer's mother's sister and his wife'smother. Not to mention Paul Gorman, who we learn was killed in a freakishmotorcycle accident; what we don't learn is who he was. And in the God-said-hadepartment, the wires report the death of the world's oldest person, at age119, who therefore missed by mere hours the superhuman hat trick of drawingbreath in three centuries.            The NYT reports that the Brooklyn arrest was accomplished by "ablack-clad antiterrorist task force," while one in Boston involved feds givingchase with guns drawn. Both papers imply that the Brooklyn arrest was helpedalong by an informant. The coverage says the Seattle bomb-smuggling planreflected sophistication, although the LAT notes "a major slip-up"occurred when the man arrested in Brooklyn, although registered under an aliasat a hotel in Seattle, used his real address.            The coverage makes it clear that beyond anything specifically tied to theSeattle bomb, the cops were doing a bit of street sweeping. The WPquotes one expert referring to probable "preemptive arrests," and saying thatthe FBI would "nail [those arrested] for anything they can, just to get themoff the streets."            A front-page WP story reports that federal investigators on the WenHo Lee case are now looking into the possibility that Lee passed nuclearsecrets not to China, but to Taiwan. The story points out that Lee has longdone consulting work for a Taiwan military institute and has two sisters whostill live on the island.            Both the WP and NYT detect hordes of non-hoards. ThePost has local merchants telling of increased traffic in bottled water,batteries, candles, etc., but nothing out of control. And the Times saysthat the extra $255 for each man, woman, and child added to the money supplyfor Y2K is just sitting there in banks.            The NYT lead editorial on the 20th century salutes "the mostdistinctive of all American inventions, a society based on the values ofpolitical freedom, economic opportunity, individual worth and equal justice."The WP puts forth a gigantic effort to assess the entire 2nd millennium,with sprawling essays on the span's history, and on its concepts of liberty,love, hate, ingenuity, fear, beauty, thought, and mystery. The effort onhistory says, "The best invention of the millennium is widely considered to bethe printing press, which is obvious and right. The rest of the top 10 are:glass lenses, the orchestra, the clock pendulum, electrification, the birthcontrol pill, refrigeration, anesthesia, indoor plumbing, and antibiotics. Themost overrated invention of the millennium is the spacecraft." The section alsoassesses the millennium's worst year as 1347 (bubonic plague comes to theContinent) and its best as 1789 (French Revolution, George Washington takesoffice, the factory system is born, bourbon is invented, Mozart writes twopiano sonatas, and Beethoven writes two preludes).            On the LAT op-ed page, Robert Reich states, "Eventually almosteveryone in the U.S. will be working directly or indirectly for MCI-Worldcom,Microsoft, Disney or AT&T." And the NYT explains that contrary toother holidays, where status in the organization is measured by thenumber/quality of party invites and the relative coolness of one's vacationplans, for tonight the most important people in the outfit are the ones whowill be working. Suddenly, Today's Papers feels very important.
