                                 The LAT Quits Smoking            The LosAngeles Times leads with the concerns of U.S. foreign affairs experts(mostly outside of, but some in, the government) that Russia, China, and Indiamight form an anti-U.S. alliance (the story also uses the more loaded word"axis"). The New York Times goeswith the serious shortage of military recruits and what the Pentagon is tryingto do about it. USA Today goes with a federal commission's proposal todayof a dramatic exception to the U.S. criminal appeals process: permittingconvicts to file appeals based on DNA evidence even if deadlines for appeals ingeneral have already expired. The Washington Post leads with Dan Quayle's likely announcementtoday that he will drop out of the presidential race. One misstep in thePost's sum-up of Quayle's career: It cites his Murphy Brown speech aboutout of wedlock births as an embarrassing incident on a par with the potatospelling episode. A fairer statement is that the speech helped make the topic aserious part of the national conversation. Aside from Quayle--played bottomfront by USAT --none of the papers' leads are fronted elsewhere.            The LAT lead says that the U.S.-spearheaded intervention in Kosovoseems to have accelerated a collaboration between Russia, China and India,which together, the paper notes, represent a vast nuclear stockpile and 2.5billion people. One of the most alarming signs of the trend: increasing armsales by Russia to the other two countries.            The NYT says that of all the service branches, only the Marine Corpsis taking in as many new recruits as planned. Some of the Pentagon's countermeasuresinclude: paying recruits $6,000 just for signing up; increasing college moneyavailable to enlistees from $40,000 to $50,000; and using brand new soldiers asrecruiters, a job formerly reserved for personnel with a real service tourbehind them. The story describes how a major Pentagon response has been torevamp recruitment advertising, so that even "Be All You Can Be"--considered tobe one of the most successful ad campaigns of all time--is likely to be junked.And it cites the shrinking pool of 18-to-22-year-olds and the booming economyas two causes of the problem. The aforementioned anomalous success of theMarine Corps suggests a politically sensitive cause that the Timesdoesn't mention: the feminization of the military hasn't made it that much moreappealing to women but has made it much less special-seeming to men.                           USAT explains that Janet Reno is expected to use the DNArecommendation to promote changes in state laws and court rules. The papernotes that since its 1987 introduction into U.S. courts, DNA evidence has beenused to exonerate 62 wrongfully convicted men (no women?).            The Wall Street Journal runs a "Rule of Law" column that weighsin effectively on an unpublicized Hawaii case about to be argued before theSupreme Court. Seems there's something there called the Office of HawaiianAffairs, which gives out money to Hawaiians of Polynesian origin, and to no oneelse. The OHA administration is likewise exclusively populated by these"native" Hawaiians. And "native" here doesn't mean "born and raised in Hawaii."Hence the lawsuit, in which a lifelong Hawaiian native who happens also to bewhite is suing for his piece of the pie. The interesting thing is that theClinton Justice Department has weighed in on the side of the status quo Hawaiirules, on the grounds that "native" Hawaiians are "indigenous" people, justlike Native Americans. The problem with this, the column points out, is thatnative Hawaiians, unlike Native Americans, don't have their own system ofgovernance, don't live on recognized reservations, and don't have treaties withthe government. If they were to be granted special rights, then why not do thesame for African-Americans, or Croatian-Americans? The DOJ position, argues thepiece, is fiercely anti-immigrant.            Sunday's LAT reported in its "readers' representative" column thatthe paper has decided to ban tobacco ads after Oct. 1. After Jan. 1, the banwill even extend to externally controlled inserts such as Parademagazine. With many papers (including the NYT ) already on thisbandwagon, how about turning up the heat on another type of advertising thatprobably cuts as wide a swath through American families--sports handicappingservices? Page 10 of today's USAT sports section features 10 ads forsuch services, which obviously promote (mostly illegal) gambling.
