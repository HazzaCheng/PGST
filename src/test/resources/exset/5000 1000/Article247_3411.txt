                                 I Sing the Straw Poll Electric                           USA Todayleads with a preliminary, non-public congressional study concluding that nineout of 10 background checks conducted by the Pentagon on employees with accessto classified information fail to meet federal standards. The Los Angeles Times goes with aJustice Department report that prison growth slowed last year--finallyresponding to a 5-year-old drop in the crime rate. For the second time in threedays, the New YorkTimes leads with Dagestan. Russian generals are claiming victoryagainst the Chechen Islamic commandos in the province, but independent militaryanalysts are skeptical. (The Wall StreetJournal also puts this story high in its "Worldwide" box.) TheWashingtonPost leads with an Iowa straw poll roundup. (For more on the Iowastraw poll, read this week's " Pundit Central.")            Conducted by the congressional General Accounting Office, a preliminaryinvestigation of 531 Pentagon security checks claims that 92 percent areincomplete, and that in 12 percent of cases the Defense Department failed tofollow leads pointing to financial problems, criminal histories, and alcoholand drug abuse. The USAT article says that the Pentagon grants 130,000top-secret clearances a year and has a backlog of 600,000 cleared employeeswhose files need review. The leaked report--which will be finalized inOctober--says the Pentagon has "created risks to national security."            The LAT reports that despite the slowdown in prison growth,mandatory sentencing rules, "three-strikes" laws, and a growing number ofparole violators have kept the growth rate from dropping as much as it mighthave. (This growth in parole violations is the focus of USAT's story,which gets a front-page reefer.) Last year's growth rate, 4.8 percent, wasconsiderably less than the decade average of 6.7 percent. But the prisonpopulation has now swelled to a record 1.3 million, and the nation's droppingcrime rates mask trends such as the increased average prison stay (22 months in1990 to 27 months in 1997, the most recent figure available).            The Post runs a fascinating feature on the informational firewallsplaced between FBI teams investigating U.S. terrorism plots--similar to thoseused in the CIA during its Cold War espionage investigations. The bureaudivides its men into "clean" and "dirty" teams; the former collects criminalevidence, the latter, intelligence. The dirty team has an attorney filter whatis illegal or too classified for the "clean" prosecutors to know. For example,in its investigation of Osama Bin Laden, the FBI received information from thePakistani government about a confession by one of Bin Laden's associates. Inthe course of obtaining their confession, however, Pakistani authoritiesallegedly starved this co-conspirator and threatened his pregnant wife.Knowledge of this confession was relayed from the dirty to the clean team,which then used the tip to help it extract its own, legal confession.            Obviously taking her lead from                   Slate               --see"Culturebox," "I Want My ElectronicBaby Sitter!"--a NYT op-ed writer uses the recent anti-TV reportby the American Academy of Pediatrics as a springboard to sing her praises tothat ultimate babysitter--the one with the blue glow: "I fondly imagined mykids glazed-eyed, slack-jawed--and quiet. I was even willing to throw in a bagof potato chips--anything to buy myself some uninterrupted hours to unpack, gothrough mail, do laundry, maybe finish that book I'd started on what we nowcould only euphemistically call vacation."                           Did They Cover to the Same Event? The Post editorsdismiss the Iowa straw poll a "test of how many people a candidate couldpersuade to take an all-expenses-paid day off to be bused to a kind ofcarnival." The Journal , however, waxes Whitmanesque about thefund-raiser: "Nearly 25,000 Iowans turned out to vote. ... We'll take thisexhibition in grass-roots democracy over most of our other modern, much moresynthetic political rituals."
