                                 Who Do You Anti-Trust?            Like yesterday, Palestine vs. Israel and DOJ vs. Microsoft dominate. Theformer leads at the Washington Post , New York Timesand LosAngeles Times , while USA Today goes with the latter. (The MS story isfronted everywhere, except the LAT , which saves it for the businesssection.) The Bill Clinton-hosted Mideast peace talks, already not going well,were sent into an even deeper freeze early Monday by a grenade attack onIsraelis in Beersheba.            The papers report that so intent is Clinton on salvaging the talks that hecanceled a scheduled Monday fund-raising trip to California to stay personallyinvolved at the rural Maryland site of the talks. And indeed, in the course ofthe day, he presided at a three-way meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu and YasserArafat--their first time in the same room since Friday. Other heads of stateare also trying to keep the sides talking--the NYT , WP , andLAT report that King Hussein of Jordan has flown to a house he owns inMaryland and was standing by to help, and the NYT says Hosni Mubarak ofEgypt has been in contact with both sides. But apparently the principals arestill flunking chemistry. The Times quotes an un-named American officialsaying that the two sides do not deal seriously with each other without an American in the room, and another saying that it prettymuch takes Clinton's presence to get talks going.            The Israeli leadership at the conference reacted to the grenade attack byinsisting that it would only discuss security issues with the Palestinians, astance the NYT calls a "dramatic negotiating ploy," probably not themost apt phrase, since there's little doubt that the Israeli concern aboutsafety from terrorism is heartfelt. But both the NYT and LATreport that later on Monday, other issues were actually discussed--theNYT doesn't say what though, and the LAT refers only vaguely tothe topic of further redeployments of Israeli troops.            All the Microsoft coverage makes it very clear that the government hasdecided to make its case very much about Bill Gates. USAT 's lead runsunder the headline "Gates Singled Out in Trial." The government started itscase, all the papers report, by contrasting Bill Gates' video deposition(displayed on a "larger-than-life screen" says the WP ; the NYTsays "10-foot") in which he said he knew nothing more about an allegedmarket-carving meeting with browser rival Netscape than what he read in thenewspaper (actually he mentioned the Wall Street Journal , a fact included byeverybody--including the WSJ --except USAT ), with a Gates email inwhich he states "...there is a very powerful deal of some kind we can do withNetscape...We could even pay them money as part of the deal, buying some pieceof them or something." USAT also notes that in the direct testimony ofNetscape CEO James Barksdale released Monday, Barksdale claims Microsoft usedthreats and bribes to get various PC manufacturers and Internet serviceproviders to go with MS' browser. Some of the papers feature an AOL exec'semail in which he claims, "Gates delivered a characteristically blunt query:'How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape? This is your lucky day.'"Wonder if "screw" kept that quote out of The Nation's Newspaper.            MS' top lawyer is widely quoted as calling the email evidence "snippetstaken out of context." The WP is pretty free with descriptions of Gates,saying that in his video depo, he was "slouching" and was "visibly testy." TheBarksdale testimony is the subject of a separate story inside the Post .Meanwhile, a pro-Microsoft NYT op-ed by a semi-conductor CEO wonders,"If Microsoft violated the law by giving away browsers, why didn'tNetscape?"            A front-page LAT story reports that military authorities, concernedby a recent spate of public Lewinsky-driven criticisms of President Clinton bymilitary personnel--in service-oriented publications and in the WSJ andon the Internet--are threatening service members with punishment if they utter"contemptuous words" about their Commander-in-Chief. The paper says the recentcriticisms represent a "downturn" in Clinton's standing with the military.            HBO should never be puzzled again about its target demographic for Tysonfight broadcasts. According to a NYT story, Iron Mike himself clearedthat up at the hearing yesterday where he regained permission to box inNevada. "I represent," he testified, "people, pimps, whores,prostitutes."
