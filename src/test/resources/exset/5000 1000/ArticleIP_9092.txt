DearPrudie,                                                      Please don't laugh. Ihave a dilemma about being a house guest. It is to flush or not to flush. WhenI stayed with an old schoolmate on a business trip, it was in her smallapartment with only one bathroom. Her room was on one side of the loo, and minewas on the other. I had to go to the bathroom in the early dawn and was tornabout whether to risk waking her with the noise of the flush or protecting thesilence (and trying to catch up with it in the morning, before shedid).                                       Whatwould Prudie advise?                                       --Hamlet in theWC                        DearHam,            Prudie isnot laughing, she is merely smiling with recognition, having had to considerthe same question on occasion. Decorum and politesse dictate that you opt forthe flush. An exception might be if your host or hostess has mentioned being anextremely light sleeper who, once awakened, is unable to fall back asleep. Analternative if you simply can't bring yourself to push the handle down in themiddle of the night would be to put a Post-It note on the closed lid advising,"Please flush." Admittedly this may call for more wakefulness than one may havegiven the hour and the circumstance. If you choose silence and can't deal withthe Post-It note, mention your concerns the next morning.            --Prudie, unflushingly                                             DearPrudie,                                                      Howlong should you date a man before deciding if he is right for you?                                       --Bewildered inD.C.                        Dear Be,            There canbe no specified time after which you know if you've found the right partner.Some people make a good selection almost immediately, just as others can take avery long time to make a colossal mistake. The romance gods are fickle. Prudieknows this from experience.            --Prudie, romantically                                             DearPrudie,                                                      As astraight male living in Dupont Circle in Washington, I have had the sameproblem as "Dimmer." A good friend, staring at a similar blonde, asked how hecould figure this out fast. I responded with the best indicators I know. Feet,hands, Adam's apple. Almost never fails.                                       --Steve, Singly                        DearSteve,            Thank youon behalf of Prudie's male readers who feel they might fall into thetransvestite trap. It must be true: Takes one to know one ... a man, thatis.            --Prudie,tellingly                                             DearPrudence,                                                      Becauseof my healthy appetite, I am quite fond of all-you-can-eat, buffet stylerestaurants. My question is: How much should you tip the wait staff? They don'ttake your order or bring your food, but they do bring drinks, remove dishes,and deliver the check. Your advice will be greatly appreciated.                                       --Perpetually Hungry inL.A.                        DearPerp,            Since theservice you receive is not that of a regular restaurant, you might wish toleave the tipping equivalent of an honorarium. Perhaps 10 percent of your billwould be correct.            --Prudie,expansively
