                                 Photo Opportunism                           USAToday leads with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's warning to Congressagainst counting on a federal budget surplus. The Washington Post leads with remarks by House BudgetCommittee Chairman John Kasich and by House Ways and Means Committee ChairmanBill Archer to the effect that expanding Medicare coverage to include youngerretirees would be a mistake. The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times go with the sudden threat to Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition.            The crux of the Israeli situation is that the Foreign Minister, David Levy,resigned on Sunday because of dissatisfaction with Netanyahu's performance onboth the social welfare and Palestinian fronts. The NYT explains thatthe move only leaves Netanyahu with a two-vote margin in Parliament. TheTimes says that without Levy, Netanyahu is likely to grow more dependenton right-wing parties, and thus to become more resistant to pro-Palestinianconcessions. USAT and the WP run the Israel story as their off-leads.            In what is no doubt the payoff for concerted auto industry press lobbying,the Wall Street Journal , NYT , and LAT eachrun front-page stories about the Big Three's renewed interest in producingless-guzzling, less-polluting cars. Readers are advised to clip and save thesefor when the car companies howl the next time the federal government tries tolower fuel economy and emission standards.            In the NYT 's story about today's opening of the Unabomber trial (runon the front in the national edition, inside in the metro edition), the pointis made that the case's story of "a brother fighting to save the life of thebrother he turned in" is "a tale of literary dimensions." But the Timesapparently doesn't feel such an observation can stand without expert testimony,so it drags in Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist William Kennedy and a litprofessor to repeat it.            The WP 's Al Kamen reports that the CIA recently overlooked scads ofAgency retirees it should have invited to its 50th anniversary gala. Why?Because it couldn't find them. How many alumni spooks didn't get to come infrom the cold? As many as 30,000, says Kamen, but he's just guessing because"the numbers are secret."            A piece inside the NYT that wonders when the downsizing trend will hit higher ed reports that between1984 and 1994, the cost of college tuition went up about 150 percent, outpacingeven medical care (111 percent).            Sunday's LAT reports that over the weekend, some Latino workers inL.A. started a hunger strike on the steps of City Hall. What's the latestcausa? A protest by gardeners over the city's imminent ban againstgasoline-powered leaf blowers. "Unfortunately, we feel a hunger strike is theonly way we can be heard," one of the strikers tells the LAT . Well no,we still can't hear you because of the... goddam leaf blowers !            Yesterday's NYT "Week in Review" included an overview of the lastmeals requested by men executed in Texas. One man's wish was that his finalmeal be given to a homeless person. Request denied.                           They're both clad only in bathing suits, alone on the beach. He clutchesher in to him with his hand on the small of her back while she's looking up athim adoringly. The fade-out still from a new romantic movie? Or one ofthose magazine ads for a Caribbean getaway? No, it's the President and FirstLady on the top front of the LAT . Nothing inherently wrong here, butthink about it....This isn't a candid shot: there isn't an inch out of focus ora blurry branch being parted. And nary a toe being sucked anywhere. And do youthink the Secret Service would let a paparazzo get even telephoto close to theFirst Couple in seclusion on their vacation? No, this is a genre that hasn'tbeen so blatant since JFK and Jackie: the romantic photo-op. And what's wrongis that, like the paparazzi's click-clicking, it's the exposure of what shouldbe an intimate family moment purely for gain, in this case, political.Inflicting privacy is as unseemly as invading privacy.
