                                 Slander Patrol: Gore's Litmus Test            John McCain says Al Gore and Bill Bradley are not qualified to be commanderin chief "based upon their support of a litmus test for future chairmen of theJoint Chiefs of Staff." The Republican National Committee is now running adsthat say the same thing. Leaving aside the minor nuance that Bradley neverendorsed any test at all, let alone a "litmus" test for the Joint Chiefschairman, is McCain right to argue that Gore's position is unreasonable?            Here's what Gore said in the debate on January 5, in response to aquestion from Peter Jennings on whether he would have a "litmus test" for thepost of chairman of the Joint Chiefs:                           I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy, on the "don't ask,don't tell" policy, that President Harry Truman brought about after World WarII in integrating the military. And I think that would require those who wantedto serve in on the position of--on the Joint Chiefs to be in agreement withthat policy. So, yes.                        In answer to a follow-up question from Jennings, Gore modified his answerslightly. "I would insist, before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, that that individual support my policy," the vice president said. "And,yes, I would make that a requirement." Requiring "support" is somewhatdifferent than requiring "agreement" (see "Kausfiles"for further analysis of this distinction). After he was attacked for theanswer, Gore made clear his preference for his second response over his first."I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into thepersonal, political opinion of officers in the U.S. military," Gore said, at animpromptu press conference two days later.            As Gore belatedly realized, "support" is the better answer, because itleaves open the theoretical possibility of appointing a military officer sohonorable that he will work assiduously to implement a policy he personallydisagrees with. But in reality, there isn't much of a difference between"support" and "agreement"--certainly not enough to constitute a "reversal,"which was how the New York Times characterized Gore's adjustment.Chairmen and members of the Joint Chiefs who "personally" oppose thisparticular change in policy are not likely to put their feelings aside andimplement it. They're likely to try to sabotage it.            Consider what happened to Bill Clinton when he tried to lift the ban on gaysin the military in 1993. In theory, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at thattime, Colin Powell, was an obedient officer ranking directly below Clinton inthe chain of command. In practice, Powell worked around Clinton to prevent apolicy change that he disagreed with. After Clinton was elected but before hewas sworn in, Powell gave a speech at the Naval Academy in Annapolis in whichhe told midshipmen that if the new policy violated their beliefs, they shouldconsider resigning from the military.            George Stephanopoulos describes the political reality of the situation inhis book All Too Human . "I knew we had no cards to play," Stephanopouloswrites, describing Clinton's first meeting with Powell and the Joint Chiefs."If we didn't work out a compromise with the chiefs, they would sabotage us onthe Hill. While they were obliged to obey their commander, they had the rightto present their personal views to congressional committees publicly." It was,in fact, the prospect of Powell and the other chiefs testifying before Congressabout their personal opposition to allowing gays to serve in the military thatgave Sen. Sam Nunn the leverage to foist Powell's own preferred compromise of"don't ask, don't tell" on the administration. And had Congress not acted, it'sentirely likely that the chiefs would have worked to sabotage the new policy atthe bureaucratic level.            For this reason, Gore's "litmus test" position is not merely defensible;it's the only sensible one to take if you seriously intend to get rid of "don'task, don't tell." By contrast, Bradley's stance--that he would expect thechairman of the Joint Chiefs to follow his orders--is utterly naive. As for theRepublican line that all the Joint Chiefs ever do is offer advice and obeytheir commander in chief, it's worse than naive. It's disingenuous.Conservatives know that litmus-untested chiefs are likely to try to undermine aDemocratic president's effort to allow gays to serve openly in the military.And what's more, Republicans want them to undermine it.
