                                 Deregulate New York City!                        The biggest news here in New York City last week was the sudden crackdown ondouble-parking. Traffic cops descended on Upper West Side neighborhoods andmidtown business streets and issued a slew of tickets. Because residents areaccustomed to double-parking on days when street-cleaning takes place--youdouble-park from 8 to 11 a.m., blocking in all the people who are parkedlegally--the crackdown was assailed as the effective criminalization of anaccepted social custom. (In some sense, it probably was, and in Moneyboxtomorrow, I'll have something on whether this matters.) But the moreinteresting aspect of Rudy Giuliani's latest attempt to bring order to our faircity was the way it showcased how little parking there is in New York.            Now, as someone who drives fairly often into the city, I'm pleased by thecrackdown, since double-parkers have the magical ability to turn three-laneavenues as wide as an Interstate into slow-moving country roads. (New Yorkdrivers will happily double-park, even while they're in their cars, rather thanpark a car too close to a fire hydrant, even though doing the latter will lettraffic move smoothly. I'm hoping the recent crackdown will change this habit.)And it's certainly true that most double-parkers are just people trying toavoid paying for a parking garage, or deliverymen trying to avoid having towalk around the corner. So no pity for them. (Except when they're me or myfriends, of course.) But people want to avoid paying for a spot in a parkinggarage because $8 seems a bit much for a half-hour. And, in any case, parkinggarages are usually full. These two phenomena are not, needless to say,unrelated.            In fact, there are way too few parking garages in New York relative to thetraffic, because the city, since the end of World War II, has limited thenumber of garages that can be built. For the existing garage owners, this is agreat deal, since it means that in most neighborhoods there's effectively nocompetition. Parking real estate is not quite as valuable as land in theHamptons, but it has a similar characteristic: The supply isn't getting anybigger, even as the demand grows.            There was an idea behind the limits on garages, which was that if you makeit easier for people to park in the city, you make it easier for them to driveinto the city, and "we" don't want that. But in a deeper sense, the limits ongarages are emblematic of the way successive administrations in New York havehandled most things: They have consistently assumed that without a strongmanagerial hand, the city would degenerate into chaos.            Take taxis. Why is it so hard to get a cab in midtown, especially on a rainyday? Because obtaining a taxi medallion is next to impossible, and the price ofthe medallions has soared out of sight. Cab fares are, of course, regulated,but that means only that the pricing is determined by whateverrelationship--good or bad--exists between the Taxi Commission and the smallnumber of companies it's dealing with. Opening the market to new competitorswould increase the number of taxis on the street--that's the whole idea--and itwould drive down prices. The fear seems to be that if you opened the market,you'd have a deluge of cabs, marring the relatively pristine streets ofManhattan. And perhaps you would at first. But pretty quickly the supply ofcabs in the city would approximate the demand.            A similar point can be made about rent control and about the haphazardapplication of zoning ordinances to commercial establishments. Pace arecent Chatterbox piece, New York is certainly an exception to his rule aboutcheap movie tickets, and one reason is that there are too few movie theatershere to meet the demand. That's partly because of the high cost of real estate,but it's also about the sheer effort it takes to negotiate with the city tobuild a movie theater.            One might say, "Thank god someone is looking out for the city ,"instead of letting it be taken over by developers and entrepreneurialcab-company owners. In that sense, the implicit governing philosophy in NewYork has been "avoid the tragedy of the commons" (while also letting the peopleon the inside wet their beaks over and over again). I don't really think a cityis a commons that will be destroyed if there isn't someone to tell us all whatto do. But if it is, then all those ticketed double-parkers are just necessaryvictims on the continued path to order.
