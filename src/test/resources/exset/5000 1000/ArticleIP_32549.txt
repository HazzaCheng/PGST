                                 <I>Gorgeous</I> Isn't Even Skin-Deep                           Movies                                                         Drop Dead Gorgeous                (New Line Cinema). Miserable reviews for thismockumentary about a Minnesota teen beauty pageant starring Ellen Barkin,Kirstie Alley, and Denise Richards. The idea of spoofing the superficial,back-stabbing world of teen pageants seems funny to most critics, but all agreethat the execution is abysmal. It relies heavily on Minnesota-bashing--the filmhas "more lutefisk and Lutheran gags than a year of A Prairie HomeCompanion " (Richard Corliss, Time )--and predictable jokes aboutstage mothers and bitchy teens. Drop Dead Gorgeous was written by aformer Minnesota Miss Teen runner-up, but despite this insider angle, it offersnothing that wasn't done better in 1975's Smile .

Frighteningly bad reviews for thisold-school horror movie: "The scariest thing about The Haunting is howawful it is. No, worse than awful: desperate" (Lisa Schwarzbaum,Entertainment Weekly ). Instead of going for the tongue-in-cheek, campyhorror style so popular of late, director Jan De Bont ( Speed ) relies onold-fashioned things-that-go-bump-in-the-night scares. Despite a tasty cast(including Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, and Lili Taylor),the only faintly amusing element of the film is the computer-generated specialeffects, which give the haunted house moving statues and doors that sproutarms. A remake of a 1963 film adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel TheHaunting of Hill House , this version cuts out the psychological elementsthat made the original compelling. Roger Ebert is the only critic to speak upin favor of the film, citing the scenery and effects as reason enough to seeit. (Click here to watch the trailer.)                           Magazine                                                         Talk               . The buzz on Tina Brown's celeb-mag reaches a fever pitcha week before the first issue appears. Already, unasked-for publicity has beenshowered on Brown's new baby, which is being published in partnership withMiramax Films. 1) New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani denied permission to host thelaunch party at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, apparently after hearing his Senateseat rival Hillary Clinton was going to be on the cover. 2) A parody Web site byBrill's Content writer Michael Colton was shut down by Miramax'sattorneys but was reinstated after Brown saw it and called off the lawyers. And3) the New York tabloids have been charting every whisper of gossip on themagazine for weeks. Brown has also been making the rounds talking up her newproject: Already this week she's done an interview in the Wall StreetJournal and been quoted at length in a piece in the "Business" section ofthe New York Times . Times reporter Alex Kuczynski writes thatTalk "more closely resembles a postmodern version of Lifemagazine or Paris Match " than Vanity Fair , and says that yes, thecover will feature Hillary Clinton, but it will also give space to Miramax starGwyneth Paltrow and George W. Bush. According to the New York Post andonline gossip sites, Brown is steamed that the magazine went to press beforeJohn F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crashed, thus missing the biggest story of themoment. (Not to mention the fact that rival Graydon Carter stopped the pressesat the last minute on the latest issue of Vanity Fair to change thecover to a pic of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.) The first copies of Talkwill be handed out at next Monday's launch party--held at the Statue ofLiberty, which is federal, not state, property--and it hits newsstands Tuesday.(Click to read David Plotz's assessment of Brown in                  Slate               .)
