                                 Luce Change            Yes, the GOP presidential candidates debated again last night, and yes, aFlorida judge at least momentarily delayed the return of Elin Gonzlez toCuba, and yes, the Supreme Court says Microsoft has to let its temp workers inon its good-deal stock purchase plan, but everybody leads with yesterday'ssurprise announcement of AOL's purchase of Time Warner, the first acquisitionof an old media company (co-founded 75 years ago by Henry Luce) by a new mediaone (only 15 years old), the largest media merger of all time, and indeed, thejust-plain largest merger of all time. Although there isn't complete agreementabout how large: The Washington Post says the purchase value of the stock is$183 billion. The New York Timessays $165 billion. The Los Angeles Times says $163 billion. USA Todaysays $160 billion. And the Wall Street Journal says $156 billion. The NYT saysthe deal will produce the fourth-most-valuable company in the country, one witha stock market value "roughly equal to the gross domestic product of Mexico."(Next week's big story: "AOL TIME WARNER DOUBLES SIZE, ACQUIRES MEXICO.")            The coverage agrees on the basic logic of the deal: In one swell foop, TWgets a tremendous Internet presence for marketing, for instance, its books andCDs; AOL gets a wide range of content in the form of TW's many mediaproperties, ranging from HBO to CNN to Time magazine; and AOL goes fromhaving no broadband capability to being positioned to go into computers in thehomes wired by the nation's No. 2 high-speed cable provider, Road Runner, whichTW is the half-owner of. The papers say that there now will be a spate of otherold-new media merger deals, so that rival companies can compete against thisnewly integrated juggernaut.            The WP points out that AOL has only one-fifth the revenue of TW, butit was able to handle the deal because it has four times as much profit and amuch higher stock value. The papers all reflect a sense that nonetheless it wassurprising to think that the young company was buying the old one instead ofvice versa.            As is typical of press coverage of mergers, breathlessness is the order ofthe day. The LAT runs at least eight stories on the deal, the NYTat least 12. USAT goes with special reports in each of its foursections. Its front-page "cover story" compares the deal to the Americancolonies' defeat of the British. The LAT seems completely out of stepwhen it bothers to point out that because of the debt the new company will takeon to seal the deal, it could be decades before it reports a profit.            Several papers take a crack at turning the spreadsheet into a novel,centering on the characters of AOL's Steve Case, who will be the chairman ofthe new company and TW's Gerald Levin, who will be its CEO, with the WPputting the most effort into it. The Post 's tale includes Levin'sdecision-making "walk in the woods" and the code words and letters used to keepdoings confidential. Case gets the papers' instant cult of personalitytreatment: Everybody notes that he likes casual clothes (although he wore asuit to the press conference and it was Levin who showed up all caj andtieless) and used to be a Pizza Hut topping designer.            Today's expert on a stick is one Robert McChesney, a professor at theUniversity of Illinois and the author of a book about media mergers. He'squoted in two different WP front-pagers and by the LAT . Althoughto be fair, if he weren't quoted there would hardly be any doubts raised in thedailies at all about the wonderful wonderfullitude of it all. He thinks thedeal is bad for freedom of expression. The WP 's media reporter Howard Kurtz also takes a crack at the threat the dealposes to independent journalism, creating as it does more financialrelationships between reporters and institutions they might be covering. Hiscolumn ends with the credit line: "Howard Kurtz appears on CNN's weekly mediaprogram."
