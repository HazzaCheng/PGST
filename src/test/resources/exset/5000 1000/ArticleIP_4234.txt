Andif you missed the most recent installments of this column, here they are:posted Tuesday, Oct. 13, and Friday, Oct.9.                        Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung saidThursday that the Bosnia and Kosovo crises have proved that U.S. leadership ofNATO is vital. In a front-page editorial headlined "Without America NothingWorks," it recalled past European efforts to make NATO less dependent on theUnited States so as to encourage France to rejoin the alliance's militarystructure. Not only did France not do so, but the failure of West European willover Bosnia and the sheer complication of the Kosovo problem made U.S.leadership essential in both cases.            Le Monde of Paris marked Friday's20 th anniversary of John Paul II's election to the papacy bycommissioning an opinion poll that shows 53 percent of French people think heshould resign. Nineteen percent disapprove strongly of the way he has done hisjob, and 34 percent say they have major reservations. Even among practicingFrench Roman Catholics, only 14 percent totally approve of him.            In extensive coverage of the anniversary, Italiannewspapers made much of the first ever papal participation in a TV chat show.The pope telephoned a popular show called Door to Door at 10:30 p.m. tothank participants in a special program about his pontificate for theircomments. The show's host, Bruno Vespa, is reported to have been reduced tostutters when the call came through.            La Repubblica of Rome reportedthat messages to be read out Friday at the ceremony in St. Peter's Square willinclude ones from Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat inviting the pope tovisit Jerusalem in the year 2000. The paper said he has agreed to go. La Stampa of Turin ran anarticle praising the pope's efforts to reconcile the Catholic Church and Jews,despite the recent controversy over the canonization of the Jewish-bornCatholic nun Edith Stein, who died at Auschwitz.            Israel'sHa'aretz expressedoptimism in an editorial Thursday about upcoming Middle East talks in the UnitedStates. "Ariel Sharon's appointment as foreign minister does not necessarilybode any intention of sabotaging the withdrawal agreement," it said. "Inaddition to the problems that his appointment might arouse, it can also be seenas a signal to the right-wing section of the government that its position willbe given full expression in the summit talks." The editorial added that "if theIsraeli delegation returns from America empty-handed, a lot of explaining willhave to be done."            The British press was dominated Thursday by adebate in the House of Lords on the Labor government's planned abolition of theparliamentary rights of hereditary peers. The government is committed toexcluding them from the upper house of Parliament but has yet to reveal itsproposals for further constitutional reform. The hereditary peers, nearly allof them conservatives, did not argue with the case for their own abolition, butrepeatedly pointed out that a nonelected chamber consisting exclusively ofgovernment nominees would be even less democratic than one dominated by peoplewho had arrived there by accident of birth. Even the liberal Guardian, which stronglysupports reform, insisted in an editorial that the government be held to its promise that "theTransition Chamber will not last forever."            The conservative Daily Telegraph revealed thatthe queen has decided, by her own choice, to do away with some of theceremonial that has traditionally surrounded the annual State Opening ofParliament. When this takes place next month, such officers as the Silver Stickin Waiting will not take part. "The sight of the Great Officers of Statewalking backwards ahead of the Sovereign will remain unchanged, however. It isunderstood that they were offered the option of walking forwards, butdeclined." All except the lord chancellor, although, the Telegraphreassures its readers, "his request to walk forwards stems from a desire toavoid an accident rather than from any modernising zeal."
