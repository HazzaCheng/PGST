                                 The Challenge of Saddam                           If you missed the mostrecent installments of this column, here they are: posted Tuesday, Nov.10, and Friday, Nov. 6.                        Israel's liberal dailyHa'aretz ledThursday with a report of the narrow Israeli Cabinet approval of the Wyeagreement, but in the same front-pagearticle it said that the Ministry of Construction and Housing had publishedits first tender as part of a plan to build 6,500 housing units at Har Homa inEast Jerusalem. "U.S. officials say that during the Wye summit, they warned[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu not to build on Har Homa, andofficials say they believe they have the prime minister's commitment not doso," the paper said. On the subject dominating most of the Middle Eastern andEuropean press--the prospect of a U.S. military attack on Iraq-- Ha'aretzquoted Israeli sources as saying that they believe Iraq is"extremely unlikely" to fire missiles at Israel. "Saddam Hussein would belikely to attack Israel only if he felt his reign was seriously imperiled," thesources said.            In itsleadarticle, the conservative Jerusalem Post said that Israeli defense officials saw a U.S.strike on Iraq as "inevitable," but they also regarded the chances of an IraqiScud attack on Israel as "next to zero." The Israeli government's orders forthe reopening of all gas mask distribution centers and the updating of chemicalwarfare protection kits were merely a precaution, the paper reported. Anop-ed piece by Daoud Kuttab in the Jerusalem Post noted adangerous trend for anti-Israeli militants always to raise their level ofviolence in periods between the first steps toward genuine peace and its actualimplementation. Calling on Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat "to stand side by sideafter any anti-peace incident and publicly repeat their unified commitment topeace and security for both peoples," Kuttab wrote that if they did this "thereis no doubt that, in time, peace will indeed be at hand."            In a front-page editorial, Italy's La Stampa noted that President Clinton, no longer the "lame duck"his enemies had called him only a few days ago, has now decided to deliver "adefinitive blow" against Saddam. Saying the Gulf states, France, and Russia areall against U.S. military action, La Stampa said that Clinton, who has"truly resumed the leadership of the world," has decided to go ahead on hisown. Corrieredella Sera of Milan reported from New York that Germany also opposes anAmerican strike against Iraq.            Theconservative Paris daily LeFigaro said in a front-page editorial that Saddam had made "a fatal error"by assuming that Clinton would emerge weakened from the midterm electionsbecause of the Monica Lewinsky affair. "The result: the six-year duel betweenClinton and Saddam has reached a point of no return. ... The American presidenthas two years to create for himself a place in the history books other thanthat of a debauchee who was lucky to reign over a period of prosperity," LeFigaro said. "The United States wants to lance the Iraqi boil, and it isready to do so on its own at any moment." But the paper blamed Saddam'sintransigence for this situation. "If one really wishes Iraq well and wants toend an international crisis, one must get rid of Saddam Hussein," it said. "Thefirst strike would therefore only be the prelude to a long offensive."            The liberal Paris newspaper, Libration, said France wasdisappointed by Iraq's response to its neutrality in the Iraqi showdown withthe United States. "It is difficult to propose mediation when one doesn'tunderstand the position of one of the parties," it quoted a French governmentsource as saying. But Libration added that, despite its"disappointment," France was still not ready at this stage to participate inany American strikes against Iraq.            In London, the Times ran a hard-lineeditorial saying that "it will not be enough this time for fire-power to bemarshalled and then abandoned on some diplomatic pretext. ... Iraq must nowaccept an expanded Unscom, with a larger proportion of American and Britishexperts, unimpeded authority, and an unrestricted timetable," the paper said."Anything less than this would only represent another escape for the Iraqidictator and more danger for the world."
