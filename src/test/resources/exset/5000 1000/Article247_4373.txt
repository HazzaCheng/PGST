                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        AOL buys Time Warner. Bill Gates steps down as CEO of Microsoft. Sega nowhas 13 percent of the U.S. video-game market. And American Mutual Holding, anIowa company, has agreed to buy the Indianapolis Life Insurance Company.Who can possibly keep up? All the more reason to buy really expensive Internetstocks, which can just keep going up. ... Actually, that doesn't seem to beworking so well. Perhaps it's time to think about the virtues of municipalbonds.            The truth is while the AOL-Time Warner deal was huge, it's more unusual nowfor a week to pass without a similar announcement. (Though I can't quiteget over the shock of that insurance deal.) In a way, the most confusing partof this week was the breathtaking volatility in the stock market, and inparticular in the Nasdaq. After a week in which tech stocks mainly moved in onedirection--down--they came rallying back powerfully, but instead of resumingtheir steady upward ascent, they've begun swinging around wildly (even morewildly than usual). Companies that have reported blowout quarters--like Yahooand Akamai--have been punished for no apparent reason, while other companiesare trading much higher or lower on no news at all.            You might say, of course, that this is just par for the course. But it feelsa little different. It feels, in fact, like investors might be thinking alittle more seriously about risk. But then it could just be the sunspots. Andwith that, on to this week's Cocktail Chat.            1. "Ford unveiled its forthcoming line of electric vehicles , and saidthey will be sold under the new brand name Th!nk. (An odd choice, given thefact that thexclamationpointunk doesn't really trip off the tongue.)Company spokesman will presumably be The Artist Formerly Known As ..., and Iimagine the advertising campaign will break new ground in the inventive use ofheretofore ignored punctuation marks."            2. "The astonishing volatility of the Nasdaq has clearly driven somepeople batty . TheStreet.com quoted one trader this week who said that sinceyou can look at a chart of the Nasdaq 100 and can see 'perfectdouble-top' (which is like looking at a cloud and seeing an elephant), weshould 'buckle our seatbelts.' The trader requested anonymity, which isn'tsurprising. Would you want to be quoted saying something that meaningless?"            3. "Most curious headline of the week , from the Times : 'GMPresses Bid for Daewoo, Vowing to Preserve Its Identity .' I don't know.I may be naive, but I think that even if this deal does go through, GM will notdisappear. But, then, I'm a dreamer."            4. "Tommy Hilfiger's stock was crushed Thursday after the companyannounced that its earnings for the fourth quarter would be well belowanalysts' expectations. Analysts attributed the company's problems to overlysubdued colors in Hilfiger's women's line . The company did say it was'fully committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value.' But what we want toknow is: Is the company now fully committed to bright colors?"            5. "Attacking America Online's acquisition of Time Warner as a danger tothe public , Jeff Cohen of FAIR included as part of his indictment of AOLits use of controversial accounting methods . Why not? God knows that howAOL used to amortize its marketing costs should certainly be front-and-centerin any discussion of this deal."            6. "The Times ' Maureen Dowd, in a column about America'sobsession with the stock market , wrote that 'now your personal trainerknows as much about one-day price movements as Warren Buffett .'Actually, I think the whole point of investing the way Warren Buffett does isthat personal trainers have always known more about one-day pricemovements than he has."            7. "Jonathan Bulkeley, CEO of barnesandnoble.com, resigned in order to, yes,spend more time with his family . In response, the stock dropped 63cents . Must be comforting to know that's how much difference investorsthought his departure would make."
