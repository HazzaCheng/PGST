                                 No Flights of Fancy                           USAToday and the New YorkTimes lead with NATO's decision, in response to Slobodan Milosevic'sapparent stand-down in Kosovo province, to lift the immediate threat ofairstrikes against Yugoslavia. The Washington Post goes with what it calls "the first sign oftrouble" with the just-brokered Middle East peace accord--Benjamin Netanyahu'spostponement of his cabinet's vote on it, citing doubts about Palestiniancompliance. (This story is the NYT 's off-lead.) The Los AngelesTimes lead is a sharp slide in a leading measure of American consumerconfidence, a story also flagged on the Wall Street Journal 's front-page news box.            The papers report that NATO emphasized it would not hesitate to takemilitary action if Yugoslavia violated the commitments it recently made topeaceful behavior in Kosovo. The NYT explains that Yugoslavianactivities will be monitored by a multinational aerial reconnaissance effort,including American U-2 spy-planes. USAT , the NYT and theWP (in its inside story on Kosovo) mention another element of NATOdeterrence: the decision to send an unspecified number of troops--possiblyincluding U.S. soldiers--to Macedonia. From there, the two papers say, thetroops could intervene in Kosovo. The LAT , in its front-page Kosovostory, doesn't mention this deployment.            The NYT explains that U.S. officials are very concerned about whetherAlbanian forces will respond to the Yugoslavian pullout by resuming their armedinsurrection, which is what prompted Milosevic's incursion in the first place.The paper reveals that the U.S. recently held extensive talks with the rebels, urging them not to attack Serbsin the region. The NYT also points out the Kosovo agreement allowsMilosevic to fight back if his forces are attacked. With on-the-groundreportage and interviews, the LAT stresses the militant attitude of theSerbs remaining in Kosovo. The WP mostly does the flip side, describingthe return of Albanians to their ravaged homes. A statistical variance:USAT says Serb forces produced 400,000 refugees. The NYT 's numberis 250,000.            The LAT lead and the Journal say that the Conference Board'sstudy of 5,000 households divined a consumer confidence level at its lowest ebbin two years and also a big decline in Americans' expectations for the future.The LAT quotes an expert saying that every recent recession has beenpreceded by a drop in this latter measure, although, the paper adds, not everydrop has been followed by recession. But the Journal quotes an economistsaying that recession would be very unusual in the current low-interestenvironment. However, such studies are closely watched, says the LAT ,because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S.economy.                           USAT 's off-lead reports that President Clinton will unveil a $156million effort today to combat AIDS among blacks and Hispanics, two groupswhere, despite the general decline in AIDS mortality, the disease remains a topkiller. The NYT and WP run inside stories on a fresh UN findingthat in Africa, AIDS is cutting life expectancy and will reduce the continent'spopulation within the next ten to fifteen years. The Times cites expertswho believe that barring a medical miracle, Botswana and Zimbabwe will lose upto a fifth of their populations to AIDS in the next decade.            An AP story on the USAT front and inside the WP reports thatthe FAA is warning pilots not to take Viagra within six hours of flying,because the color discrimination problems sometimes associated with the drugcould make it hard to interpret cockpit gauges and runway lights.            A letter writer to the WP , who claims to have workedfor some of the biggest Cabinet departments, asks an interesting question: Whyis the federal government accusing Microsoft of monopolistic business practiceswhen, he says, those departments discourage the purchase of non-WindowsPCs?            The back pages of the Post also disclose that a just-releasedindependent counsel's report found that high-ranking government officialscommitted a "monumental and calculated abuse of the public trust." How couldthe WP possibly justify running one of Ken Starr's reports on page 17?Well, it's not Starr's report--it's the independent counsel's report onwrongdoing at HUD, an investigation that got started more than eight yearsago.
