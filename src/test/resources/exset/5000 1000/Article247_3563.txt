                                 Viacom's Acquisition of Mel Karmazin                        If there's anything odd about the just-announced merger between Viacom andCBS, it's that it seems utterly quaint to worry about whether the concentrationof so many cable, radio, network TV, and Internet assets in one company is thebest thing for the free flow of information in a democracy. FCC regulations mayrequire the new Viacom to sell a few of its TV stations--because there's a rulesaying one company can't own stations that serve more than 35 percent of theUnited States--and to either spin off or fold in the still-struggling UPN. Butfor all intents and purposes, the $35 billion deal is done.            When you think about whether it should have been done, you end upconfronting again a central paradox of the media business today: The morefragmented audiences and consumer markets become, the more important scaleappears to be. That's true both because the larger you are, the easier it isfor you to re-purpose content across many different platforms (how's that for ajargon-laden clause) and the easier it is for you to promote that content inmany different places. In the end, the ability to distribute content (andadvertising) is probably as important as the ability to produce content, andeven though in the age of the Internet and 95-channel cable systems you'd thinkanyone can get a message out there, successful distribution is still basicallyall about aggregating lots of people. In the old days, CBS could do that justby broadcasting All in the Family . Today, it has to use its radiostations, its billboards, its TV stations, and its broadcasts. But the factthat it can use all those different outlets is essential.            Now, you could think of this as synergy. And certainly Sumner Redstone, CEOof Viacom, likes that idea, as evidenced by things like Simon & Schuster'sselling MTV books, Paramount's releasing The Rugrats movie, and so on.But in a way Redstone's "content is king" refrain seems a bit old-school nextto the "distribution is king" refrain of Mel Karmazin, who is head of CBS andwill be the operational head of the new Viacom. Redstone has done an excellentjob of managing Viacom in the past couple of years, selling off assets, payingdown debt, and generally focusing the company on its core operations. But it'sKarmazin, who will be president and chief operating officer of the new company,who's really essential to Viacom's future, because it's Karmazin who recognizesthat no matter what you make, if people don't see it or hear it, it doesn'tmatter.            Karmazin's relentless focus on shareholder value and his essential frugalityas an executive have long distinguished him from the media moguls--likeRedstone--who spent much of the '80s and early '90s borrowing huge sums ofmoney to make questionable acquisitions and engage in hostile takeover battles.Karmazin came to CBS from radio chain Infinity Broadcasting (which CBS stillowns), and brought to CBS a measure of economic rigor that for a long time washard to find in the media business. When you listen to Karmazin, you get thefeeling you're listening to someone who thinks that media companies should bejudged by the same economic and business standards as other companies, asopposed to someone who thinks that media companies should be valued by thegrandiosity of their dreams. Needless to say, this is a good thing.            The irony, though, is that while Karmazin is the new-model media exec("mogul" being a word that doesn't fit), one of his greatest strengths is hisability to recognize the value of the seemingly mundane. Radio and outdooradvertising, for instance, are incredibly un-glamorous. But they're alsofast-growing markets (unlike, for example, television or even the movies), andKarmazin has ensured that CBS has reaped great benefits from them. Local TVstations are similarly boring, but while they are not the cash cows they oncewere, they're still very profitable, and Karmazin has agitated (successfully)for a relaxation of federal regulations to allow CBS to own more than onestation in a given market. Cable is not a booming business--though it may be inthe future once we all go to digital cable--but it is a profitable one, andthis deal gives Karmazin a host of cable networks to play with. All mergersshould, given the historical record, be greeted with skepticism. But inacquiring the rights to Karmazin's services and CBS's assets, Sumner Redstonemay have made the best decision of his business career.
