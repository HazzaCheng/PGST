Issue 1: Allegations that Chinese and corporate campaign donations toClinton and the Democrats compromised U.S. security. Issue 2: The court'srejection of Clinton's executive privilege claim for Secret Service guards. Thecrumbling tobacco deal places a distant third.            "It'sserious," says Mark Shields (PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ) of theprima facie evidence of a Chinese- and corporate-quid for an Americansatellite-technology transfer quo. The commentariat agrees. "What was thenational security damage?" asks Paul Gigot ( NewsHour ). The pundits chewon the question, but nobody can connect the dots of satellite waivers, know-howleaks, and campaign donations, says Margaret Carlson (CNN's CapitalGang ).            Only Pat Buchanan ( The McLaughlin Group ) and WilliamSafire (NBC's Meet the Press ) discern a distinct pattern ofplay-for-pay. Safire expresses "no doubt" that the Chinese influenced U.S.policy with their money. ("Am I glad we're off the sex topic," Safire adds.)Bill Kristol (ABC's This Week ) finds watershed significance in the factthat Hill Democrats deserted Clinton in the vote on future satellite waivers.The China connection is "driving a wedge" between Democrats and Clinton,Kristol says, and the Hill vote foreshadows future defections from TeamClinton.            Temperingthe hard line are Susan Page and Steve Roberts (CNN's Late Edition ), whosay corporate soft money--not foreign money--is the real problem. Doris KearnsGoodwin ( Meet the Press ) further puddles the issue, insisting the "wholesystem has become corrupted." Other pundits downplay the accusations of treasonand malfeasance, noting that Republican presidents were the first to enlistChinese assistance in launching U.S. satellites (Doyle McManus, PBS'sWashington Week in Review ; Eleanor Clift, The McLaughlinGroup ).            Clinton's trip to China and scheduled visit toTiananmen Square draws fire from Tony Blankley ( Late Edition ) and ChrisMatthews ( The McLaughlin Group ), who calls it Bill's "Bitburg." GeorgeStephanopoulos finds the symbolism of Clinton's Tiananmen visit "shameful." ButGeorge Will speculates that Clinton could turn the visit into a big moment ifhe uses the occasion to denounce the massacre.            LiberalAl Hunt ( Capital Gang ) frames the weekend's dull center, imploring JanetReno to get to the bottom of Chinagate by appointing an independent counsel toinvestigate campaign-finance violations.            The court's rejection of the executive privilege claim forClinton's Secret Service guard--Issue 2--is interpreted as a huge victory forbruised Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr is batting "10 for 10" againstpresidential legal challenges, note Tim Russert ( Meet the Press ) andFred Barnes ( Fox News Sunday ), proving that he's "not a rogueprosecutor" (Susan Page, Late Edition ). "The judge was downrightscornful of the White House," adds Barnes.            The executive privilegeruling is a big so-what for Safire and Juan Williams ( Fox News Sunday ).Clinton doesn't really mind losing individual court cases as long as losingbuys him time. His "delaying" strategy is to run the clock down until theNovember elections, then win Congress back with just 12 new seats and shut downthe Hill investigations with his new majority.            Thetobacco settlement--Issue 3--is dead for now, says Gwen Ifill ( WashingtonWeek in Review ). "The Senate just isn't in a barter mood, which is what[legislation] requires," Ifill says.                           Sorry, It Was Never in My Mouth: "The Monica Lewinskycase, per se, has left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths," sayspundit-in-training Ruth Conniff of the Progressive ( Fox NewsSunday ).                           Mark Shields Loves Late Edition :Punditry's leading exponent of redundancy, Mark Shields, plows new ground onNewsHour . Ordinarily, he recycles sound bites from his FridayNewsHour gig on Saturday's Capital Gang . This week, Shieldsexpresses amazement at the White House spin machine's "cautious, almost slow"response to the Chinagate accusations. This precise sentiment was voiced lastweek by Tucker Carlson on Late Edition .                           --JackShafer
