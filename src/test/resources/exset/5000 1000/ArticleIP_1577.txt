                                 Slates You Can Wear                           Hotel Ballroom ,produced by Paul Wolfe, Jeff Iorillo, Corey Stolberg, and Robert Gondell ofFoote, Cone & Belding in San Francisco.            The inevitabilities of agedictate that Generation Xers grow up, get a job, and go places--whether theywant to or not. But the age-old question remains: What to wear? This spot,Hotel Ballroom , produced for Levi Strauss by Foote, Cone & Belding,suggests to Gen-Xers that your pants can have the same attitude as you--stillyoung (they're Levi's, but not jeans), and a good fit; comfortable in your ownidentity, yet at ease in the establishment world. Well, just enough to getby.            At first look, we don't knowwhat the ad's about. We see a twentysomething guy, wearing a tie but no coat(it's in the garment bag--wear it only when you have to), entering a grandhotel. The lobby, which is shot in black and white, possesses a grandeur seldomseen today outside beaux-arts train stations. There's a sense ofsomething older in this space, but not of the past. It's the time-space ofgrown-up commitments, where the Gen-Xer has to live--at least part time. Maybecolor is reserved for nights and weekends. But even in the black-and-whiteworld, the Gen-X attitude is still evident. The clerk, initially seen upsidedown, hints at a world turned on its head.            As the guy in the pantsapproaches the desk, the clerk accepts that he belongs. Like the pants, ourhero fits--but in his own way. With a wan smile, he asks for the phone. Theclerk half-reluctantly points it out. He can't question the Gen-Xer, who'scarrying an attach case; this guy could be anything, even a young computermogul.            As he strides toward thephone, we hear the narrator's voice for the first time: "You know those pantsthat always fit ..." But our hero doesn't find the phone; he gets a littlelost. This world may accept him as fitting in--but he's in it, not of it. He'skind of an innocent abroad--innocent, of course, in a limited sense. He wandersinto a political rally and ends up on stage. We see the scene from theGen-Xer's perspective: the politician's evident insincerity (aren't allpolitics staged and phony?) and the endemic irrelevance of the proceedings. Ourhero's demeanor speaks volumes, as the politician shakes his hand and photosare taken as mementos of this nonevent. But he does fit in--if only for amoment and in his own way--before extricating himself and moving on.            Almost Zelig-like in thesucceeding scenes, he continues to fit in without getting permanently trapped.He backs across the stage toward a podium where they are giving out awards; isthis a case of mistaken award-giving, or is he just a reluctant winner? He'stoo young, and there are too many self-congratulatory award ceremonies anyway,the ad seems to say.            In another scene, he fitsinto a wedding ("There you are," the grandmother says); but at least he's notthe groom--he's not yet dressed in one of those (rented) black-tie outfits thatnever seem to fit. The background for the picture is a painted outdoor scene.That's where he'd rather be. Instead, he's suddenly in the hotel hallway again.Hands on hips, he pauses, then strides toward another of those situations inwhich maturing Gen-Xers will inevitably find themselves, as we hear the onlyother bit of narration in the spot: "These are those pants ... these areSlates." The hotel clerk's hand hits the bell, summoning a bellhop to take ourhero to his room--or is it a suite? What happened to the garment bag orbriefcase? Did he check them? Did he ever find the phone--and where's hiscellular?            At the end, we glimpse oncemore the rich wood-paneled hallway. Does it lead to a dead end, or to adoorway? Whatever it is, the ad seems to say, you can go there wearing yourSlates, and still be yourself.            You canwrite what you want on a slate; it isn't just a copybook. You can go where youhave to wearing Slates, without losing your identity. You're still wearingLevi's, even if you're the only one who knows it. In their world, you're stillGen-X, and you still see it all the same way--mostly.            --RobertShrum
