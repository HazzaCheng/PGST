                                 Organ-ized Crime?            The U.S. reaction to the U.N.-brokered Iraq deal is the consensus top story.The papers report that President Clinton gave his tentative OK to it, but alsothat he will keep the built-up U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region to makesure Iraq keeps up its end. It's also noted all around that in his remarksyesterday, Clinton reserved the right to respond in the "manner of our ownchoosing" to any Iraqi breach of the new accord.            The actual details of the deal are still somewhat unclear, but it hasemerged that the U.N. weapons inspectors will be accompanied by diplomats--asyet unidentified-- in their tours of the disputed Iraqi presidential sites. TheWashington Post reports that some U.S. and U.N.officials said that the proposed arrangement implicitly supports the Iraqicritique of the original inspection set-up. But perhaps more telling, the paperalso reports that the president's senior advisors expressed relief at thelast-minute veer away from an air war. And that includes military advisors, oneof whom is quoted, "We had a tough time seeing where this was going to takeus."            In a New York Timesfront-page "news analysis" piece, R.W. Apple states that Clinton didn't havemuch choice about the U.N. deal because he was unwilling from the start tocontemplate a campaign that would drive Hussein from power, but only one thatwould make him submit to U.N. authority.            The Times has the most reporting on the domestic political reactionto the deal, stating that some Republicans charge that Clinton has abdicatedthe making of foreign policy to the U.N., and that the general mood in Congresswas caution and skepticism. Trent Lott is quoted as being concerned that theadministration had "subcontracted its foreign policy to [the U.N.'s Kofi]Annan." Surprisingly, Newt Gingrich said he didn't have those qualms.Democratic Senator John Kerry articulates the central worry: "How do we avoidthis ratcheting up on an annual basis?"            The WP front reports that Kenneth Starr has subpoenaed White Houseadviser Sidney Blumenthal to appear before a grand jury to answer questionsabout any role he might have had in disseminating negative information aboutStarr's staff to reporters. The paper says the subpoena is "particularly broad"and signals "an escalation in the battle between the White House and theindependent counsel." The NYT says Blumenthal was incensed and also thathe accuses Starr of leaking his subpoena to the media.            The NYT front reports that an FBI undercover operation in New York,prompted by a tip from celebrated Chinese exiled dissident Harry Wu, hasproduced the arrest of two men for trying to sell organs from the bodies ofexecuted Chinese prisoners. Allegedly, it was eye corneas at $5,000 a pair, andkidney transplants for $20,000 plus. Also in the offing apparently werepancreases, livers, lungs and skin. The WP runs its organs-for-salestory inside, pointing out that one of the arrested men said that he couldguarantee skin from young prisoners and lungs from ones who didn't smoke.Provided that the "donors" in question are legitimately tried and executed,neither piece, it seems, really makes it clear exactly why this practice isinherently deplorable. After all, the Post notes, the U.S. suffers froman acute shortage of organs for transplant.            The Wall Street Journal "Work Week" column reports that aresearcher has found that despite worker assumptions to the contrary, childlessemployees do not work longer hours than their colleagues raising kids.            Does Mary Bono, Sonny's widow, believe in good old-fashioned conservativefamily values? The WP reports that Ms. Bono has left her newlyfatherless seven-year-old and nine-year-old in school back in California whileshe came to Washington to raise money for her campaign to win her latehusband's congressional seat. Does the prospect of even lengthier absences,should she win, daunt her? Well, Bono says, "Congress is in recess often enoughwhere I could be [with the children in Palm Springs] for weeks at a time."
