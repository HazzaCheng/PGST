                                 No Mas Movement                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with Janet Reno's decision to continueher investigation of Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign fund-raising, while theNew York Timesand the Los Angeles Times go with the Supreme Court's okay ofOregon's assisted suicide law.            Reno's decision was predicted by the NYT yesterday. By contrast,USAT had said she was being advised to stop investigating. Today'sUSAT says that her Justice task force had indeed been for stopping butultimately concluded there were too many unresolved legal questions to do so.Clinton's reaction to the news: "I didn't do anything wrong."            The Supreme Court turned down an appeal of a lower court's dismissal of alawsuit challenging Oregon's law, making that state the first in the countrywhere doctor-assisted suicide is legal. A wrinkle in all this, reports theNYT , is that the Oregon legislature had already decided to put thequestion to the voters again, so another by-mail referendum currently underwaywill probably be concluded before the original law can take effect.            The LAT , more than the NYT , emphasizes the Supreme Court'sgeneral stance on assisted suicide laws--that they involve no constitutionalissue and hence are the province of the individual states.            It looks like California is on its way to its third counter-reformationreferendum result in a row. The LAT runs a front-page story concerning apoll about a likely ballot measure that would virtually eliminate bilingualpublic education in California. Those surveyed are wildly for it. Thispreference of landslide proportions doesn't vary much no matter the race,income level or age group of the respondents. And here's the big news: Latinovoters polled favored the initiative by an even greater margin than whites.Though fascinating, the story does have a defect common to much press pollreporting--nowhere before the story's "jump" to the inside (where, it is wellknown, a lot of readers never tread) does the LAT reveal how large thesample is.            Last spring, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chrysler had adopted apolicy of requiring magazines where it advertised to give it advance notice andpre-publication content summaries of controversial articles. Today, theJournal , following up a Detroit News story from yesterday,reports that, after mounting criticism from magazine editors and publishers,the car company reversed itself. There are, however, notes the Journal ,other companies who still insist on editorial peeks. Ameritech, forinstance.            The WP gives front-page play to a study by Dartmouth medicalresearchers about the health-care treatment Americans receive at the end oftheir lives. Their findings: the amount of medical care received variestremendously around the country and is apparently more a function of what'savailable than of what's needed. For instance, even though there is no evidenceof major regional health or mortality differences, on the East Coast, peopleare more than two times as likely to die in a hospital as people are on theWest Coast. The upshot: patient preference about final care still isn't heededmuch, and much government medical spending on the elderly is unnecessary.            There are fascinating details from last week's American spy arrests on theTimes front. After the Berlin Wall came down, the spies--a Pentagonlawyer, her husband, and a friend--who had sold secrets to East Germany formany years, felt at loose ends and were anxious to get back in the game. And in1995, the woman wrote a very personal letter (the Times calls it an"ideological come-on") to a Communist in the post-apartheid South Africangovernment indicating her availability to continue the old struggle. The FBI,who had been monitoring this woman based on spotty information from East Germanintelligence files, intercepted the letter and forged a reply inviting her tospy for South Africa. Eventually the woman met with a person she thought was aSouth African agent and for $1,000, gave him a Pentagon spending document and aCIA memorandum on the international arms market. He was an FBI agent. Similartraps were set for the two men. The story contains at least one suggestion thatthe couple had a deep need to get caught: they named their kids after thefounders of the German Communist Party.
