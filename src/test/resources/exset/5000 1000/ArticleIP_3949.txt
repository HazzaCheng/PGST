House WhitewaterCommittee Chairman Dan Burton provided grist for the "Clinton and the Media"thread. Clinton's critics defended Burton's name-calling in a Dallas MorningNews interview as essentially truthful; defenders wondered if Burton wasmerely projecting. Meanwhile, the discussion over who's really introuble--Clinton or Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr--has grown more polarizedand personal. Clinton's critics have turned up the rhetoric, even referring tohim as a "rapist"--while Starr's critics are accusing him of being party to awitness-tampering scheme. It's getting ugly.            In the"BigQuestions" thread, fraygrants argued about interpretations of theConstitution and definitions of personal and religious freedom. Also debated:E.O. Wilson's new book, Consilience . The former ant-nut has written whatone fraygrant called "a historical polemic--that the Enlightenment thinkerswere right, after all." Will the social sciences fall under the combined weightof the humanities and natural sciences? Steven Pinker's review in                  Slate                and the Atlantic Monthly 's interview with Wilson have stoked the flames.                           NewThreads                        William Faulkner's TheSound and the Fury was the subject of the new "Reading" thread thisweek. Chapter 1, a k a the "Benjy" chapter, was deemed "a tour de force rankingwith anything Joyce, Dickens, or Shakespeare wrote" by the thread's host. Whoand what influenced The Sound ? James Joyce and Ulysses ? Can onlya Southerner truly appreciate Faulkner's settings? Contributors to thediscussion ranged from novices to experts; they included a teacher who sharedher experience of introducing the novel to students and an author who haswritten on Phil Stone (the model for several Faulkner characters) for theMississippi Lawyer .                                             Slate               's "Gist" and Sarah Kerr's review ofWalking Out on the Boys kicked off debate in the new "Sexual Harassment"thread: Is a single pass by a superior sexual harassment, or is a pattern ofrepeated abuse necessary? One fraygrant's perspective: "I'd much rather workwith someone who was honestly attracted to me and took 'no' for an answer thansomeone who may or may not be honestly attracted to me but wants to cow me inany case." Bill Clinton, Clarence Thomas, and Bob Packwood were compared, withthe consensus ruling that only Packwood may have been guilty of real sexualharassment. Also examined: the lasting effect of Thomas' hearings on hisperformance in the Supreme Court.                           FrayFeuds                        This week as last, the"Language"thread was on a roll. The discussion on language and culture moved to the needfor self-appointed "language mavens" such as William Safire. Some fraygrantstook the prescriptivist position: People must be told how to use the languageif it isn't to succumb to its natural tendency to go "all higgledy piggledy."Tosh, said the opposition. All language needs to do is communicate one'smeaning clearly. The mavens are fools to fight the "tide of languagechange."

Post ofthe Week                        In the Sexual Harassmentthread, the debate over an acceptable definition of the term led one fraygrantto post a statement on what is appropriate in the workplace. inspired reactionsfrom both sides of the table, ranging from "Yes, that's exactly it" to"Call me a cynic, but I ain't quitting a job for a f--k unless I'm SURE it'slove and even then, dammit, HE can quit."
