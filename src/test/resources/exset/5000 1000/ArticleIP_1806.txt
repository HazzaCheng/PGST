                                 Poll Sitters            Here ismy favorite Flytrap nugget from this morning's papers. The WashingtonPost writes:            Neither House Speaker NewtGingrich (R), at home in Georgia, nor Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott(R-Miss.), in Florida for a vacation, commented on the speech. Also unavailablewas House Judiciary Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), the pivotal figure in animpeachment inquiry. ... Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) wastraveling in rural areas of South Dakota and unreachable throughout the dayyesterday, his office said. House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.)was in Europe.            Now evenpoliticians are entitled to a private life, as President Clinton noted lastnight, and (as he didn't note) that includes the right to vacation in August.But does anyone else find it suspicious that on what will undoubtedly be one ofthe most important political days of their lives, so many of them wereunreachable? (Daschle's "rural areas of South Dakota"--that's a good one! Don'tthey have phones in rural South Dakota? Didn't the New Deal take care ofthat?)            Contrast this with the pundits, who set new recordsyesterday for quantity and speedy delivery of blather. Clinton spoke for fourminutes. Four minutes after he finished, dozens had already rendered judgmenton the various networks. But pundits are paid to be interesting, not to beright. All they make is opinions. Politicians, by contrast, make decisions--inthis case, their opinion on Clinton may turn into a decision about impeachment.So yesterday's silence from Gingrich, Lott, et al. reflected an admirabledesire to think through the weighty issues that ...            No, Idon't believe that. The Republican reticence can be partly attributed to theancient rule of politics: Don't kill your enemy when he's committing suicide.(Gingrich even warned his GOP underlings to keep quiet.) But the main reasonfor silence from congressional leaders of both parties was the modern politicalpractice of poll sitting. Don't express an opinion until you're sure it'sshared by at least 51 percent of one of Mr. Gallup's random samples.            Until 10:06 p.m. last night, Flytrap was acomplicated issue. The most basic facts were in dispute, and a political leadercould plausibly decline to express an opinion. Now the basic facts are clear,and there are very few opinions to choose from. You believe that 1) adulterywith a 22-year-old intern and lying both publicly and under oath about it aresufficient grounds for impeachment; or 2) these are insufficient, but evidenceyet to come out about obstruction of justice might be sufficient; or (3) thewhole thing should go away right now. You are permitted to weave variations ona few side issues--for example, was his apology groveling enough? But you areno longer permitted to say the basic question is unclear or you need more timeto think. You've had seven months to think.            Say whatyou want about an impeachment zealot such as Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., but at leasthe had the courage to go on national television last night and argue forcontinuing investigation. A few bold Democrats such as Rep. Barney Frank ofMassachusetts also rose quickly to Clinton's defense last night. But amongCongress' leaders, it seems, there was no reason to get ahead of the polls.            Today, Gingrich, Lott, Gephardt, and Hyde broke theirsilence with some of the most mealy-mouthed statements you could ever hope tohear. But suppose that a week or a month from now it becomes clear that thevoters have turned against Bill Clinton and impeachment is a salableproposition. At that point you can expect to hear ringing moral judgments fromGingrich and Lott, which they could just as easily assert today if they 1)really believed this stuff and 2) had the guts. And if it becomes clear thatvoters side with Clinton, Gephardt and the congressional Democrats will turn upthe self-righteous anger.            And if the polls areambiguous, the assertion of timeless values by both sides will just have towait.
