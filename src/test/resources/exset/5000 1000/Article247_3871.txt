                                 <i>Fortunate Son</i> Revisited            It took me about an hour on Monday to figure out that Fortunate Son , the book that accuses GeorgeW. Bush of getting arrested for cocaine in 1972, was a crock (see "Busting Bush's Biographer"). I say this not to congratulate myself (well,not merely to congratulate myself) but to ask why St. Martin's Press, whichannounced yesterday that it was "suspending" publication of the book, wasunable to make a similar determination before shipping 70,000 copies to bookstores--copies that it has so far not recalled, by the way. These peopleevaluate books for a living. Why couldn't they smell the huge fish rotting inthe top drawer?            The answer is that book editors, and especially some of those at St.Martin's, are very skilled at holding their noses. People often assume thatbooks are more reliable than newspapers and magazines because they are printedon higher quality paper and bound between hard covers. Nothing could be furtherfrom the truth. Book publishers have the lowest editorial standards injournalism, with the possible exception of the Drudge Report andSalon (which after putting the rumor into play in August and hyping the charges in Hatfield's book , is now reporting on the scandal as a disinterested third-partyobserver).            In news journalism, editors assume a degree of responsibility for theveracity of what they edit. If a newspaper reporter quotes anonymous sources,his editor will usually want to know their identity, so he can reach someconclusion about whether they are trustworthy. Many magazines employfact-checkers (whose work is premised on the books-are-more-reliable fallacy).In book publishing, by contrast, editors avoid getting involved in issues ofreliability. Before the Dallas Morning News exposed him as an attemptedmurderer and he went underground, J.H. Hatfield told me that his editor onlyknew who one of his three alleged anonymous sources was. (I stipulate that Ihave no idea whether this is true, since St. Martin's employees refused allcomment.) Nothing in a book is ever fact-checked. And when the contents of abook are attacked, the editor is not obliged to defend them or even to have anopinion on the matter.            Thomas L. Dunne, the editor at St. Martin's Press under whose imprintFortunate Son appears, has taken this position explicitly in the past.In 1996, various individuals and organizations called upon St. Martin's not topublish a biography of Joseph Goebbels by the Holocaust revisionist DavidIrving. In defending his decision to publish the work (which St. Martin'ssubsequently dropped), Dunne made it clear that he considered it absurd forpeople to expect him to judge the author's reliability. "I have been told,"Dunne wrote in his press release, "that Mr. Irving is at the center of muchcontroversy of late and has been accused--and I do not know if this is true ornot--of denying the Holocaust." After making it sound like he knew about thebook only from reading about it in the newspaper, Dunne went on to assert thatfor an editor to sit in judgment of his own books would be censorship!            In place of editorial standards, book publishers have legal ones. While theymay not care whether what they publish is true or not, they do care whetherthey can be sued. So lawyers vet books like Fortunate Son for libel. Buta good libel lawyer doesn't charge his clients $300 an hour to serve as afact-checker. He concentrates on the risk that a living person might actuallysue his client. And in an instance like this one, a libel lawyer would say thatthe chance of a lawsuit was next to nil, even if he suspected that FortunateSon was fabricated out of whole cloth. Why? Because nonexistent sourcescan't sue, and politicians don't sue. By filing for libel, acandidate or elected official would open himself to an open-ended process oflegal "discovery." In this case, George W. Bush would be a fool to allow thatto happen even if he stood a chance of winning a judgment against St. Martin's.To sue would mean that Bush would have to answer endless questions about hispast drug use, among other things.              The lesson of this shameful episode is clear: caveat lector . Andcaveat especially lectors of books published by St. Martin's Press.
