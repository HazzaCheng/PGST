                                 The Miracle Mile                           Movies                                                         The Green Mile                (Warner Bros.). The critics render asplit verdict on Shawshank Redemption director Frank Darabont'sthree-hour adaptation of Stephen King's serial novel. The film chronicles thetime served on death row by a massive, simple, and saintly black man (MichaelDuncan) convicted of molesting and murdering two young girls, as well as hisrelationship with his white jailer, played by Tom Hanks. Some are moved by thefilm's themes of redemption and spirituality; Roger Ebert says it's full of"vivid characters, humor, outrage and emotional release" (the ChicagoSun-Times ). Less kind reviews note the "inadvertently racist overtones" ofthe relationship between Hanks and Duncan (Janet Maslin, the New YorkTimes ) and say the movie has the "suffocating deliberateness of a river ofmolasses" (Kenneth Turan, the Los Angeles Times ). (David Edelstein themovie in                   Slate               : "not all of the movie is melodramatic,pseudo-mystical drivel--only about two hours and 15 minutes.")                                             Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo                (Buena Vista Pictures).Not surprisingly, a slew of bad reviews for this bottom-feeding comedy about afish tank cleaner who falls into the gigolo business by accident: "Amongdevotees of comedy, Deuce Bigalow is for the undemanding" (Lawrence VanGelder, the New York Times ). Some go so far as to insult the cast,calling star Rob Schneider "a runty fellow of no particular talent" (SusanWloszczyna, USA Today ). One reviewer pipes up in the movie's defense,calling Deuce "an hour-and-a-half goof on kinky sex, bathroom humor andinner happiness  a considerable cut above the crop of recent features by otherSNL alums" (which is not saying much) and that it's "funnier than itdeserves to be, not to mention rather sweet in a sophomoric,manwhore-with-a-heart-of-gold kind of way" (Michael O'Sullivan, theWashington Post ).

Book                                                         Hillary's Choice               , by Gail Sheehy (Random House).Sheehy's psychological biography of the first lady is deemed old news by thecritics ("compartmentalization, the need of children of alcoholics to pleaseand Hillary the enabler, who feels closest to Bill when she's saving him fromimpending disaster") that will be of use only as a "compendium of all theprevious reporting on the Clintons' marriage" for "people who have been trappedin a mine for the last few years" (Gail Collins, the New York Times BookReview ). The Washington Post 's "Reliable Source" column has had afield day pointing out factual errors in the book over the past few weeks.Although Sheehy has a weakness for writing about "how our leaders feel, notwhat they stand for or what might become of them or even what we should thinkabout the things they do," the book has one point in its favor: It has theirresistible pull of "good local gossip" (Judith Shulevitz,                  Slate               ).

Death                                       JosephHeller (1923-1999). The author of Catch-22 died of a heartattack Sunday. Best known for his absurdist treatment of World War II, Hellerpublished six novels as well as plays, screenplays, and TV comedy. AlthoughCatch-22 received mixed reviews when first published, it eventually soldmore than 10 million copies in the United States and "enriched the Americanlexicon with its title slogan and its new definition of absurdity" (Elaine Woo,the Los Angeles Times ). Heller's seventh novel, Portrait of an Artistas an Old Man , was completed just before his death and will be publishednext year.
