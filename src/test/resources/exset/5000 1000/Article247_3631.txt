                                 Fly Me to the Moon                        One of my thousands of favorite things about New York is how weather-proofit mostly is. How it takes a three-foot snowstorm to shut it down, and eventhen the subways work. But all this changed a couple of weeks ago, when therewas a flash flood that shut down the city completely. Absolutely flooded thesubway system. Do you know why? I do. Because they're not spending enough moneykeeping the drains clean. This was in the newspapers, I think, but it's one ofthe nice side-effects of living with a former political journalist who is anexpert on all sorts of things like tertiary sewage-treatment facilities. I justheard from New York that everyone is being sent home from work at 1 o'clocktoday; that would never have happened but for the incident a couple of weeksago.            So you are thinking of canceling a book signing just because no one willcome?  You must go. I insist.            Yesterday you wrote that the '90s don't exist as a culturally distinctdecade. You are so wrong. The '90s began in around 1985, when the '70s ended.The '60s were about sex, the '70s were about drugs, and the '90s are aboutmoney. There were no '80s. They never happened. I know this: I am about to makea movie that takes place in the '80s, and when you make a list of what the '80swere, you come down to a list of what they weren't: no cell phones, no colorcomputers, no SUVs, no botox, no Starbucks, no Web sites, no *69, etc. For thepurposes of the movie, I think of the '80s as the moment just before everythingthat is currently happening happened.            This brings me to a thing I love to think about, especially when I fly toLos Angeles: the private plane. I didn't fly on one, I hasten to say. But I didread Vanity Fair on the plane, and if you look at their list of theNew Establishment, 45 out of 50 of them have private planes or access to them.I'm sure the other five think of nothing but how to get them. There are peoplein Hollywood who would truly rather die than be seen flying commercial. Infact, last year one of my Hollywood friends was visiting New York and said hewas going back to Los Angeles the next day. The next day I saw him and said, "Ithought you were going home." "We couldn't get out," he said. Now, what hemeant was not that he couldn't get a flight home--there are, as you know,dozens of flights to L.A. every day--but that he couldn't get the Warner jet.He actually stayed an extra day in New York rather than submit to thehumiliation of American Airlines.            And guess what! This brings me to Ron Perelman. Yay. Or the Ron Perelmans ofthe world. Because if you really want to know how these guys get beautifulwomen to sleep with them, I'll tell you: They take them on their jets. The jetis a powerful aphrodisiac. The jet is the thing that causes the Patricia Duffsof the world to lose their minds. The jet is the thing that makes them all dothe I'll-never-go-hungry-again thing. (Back to Gone With the Wind , somaybe it belongs on that list of the century's 10 best after all.) In fact,when Ron Perelman and Patricia Duff broke up, at the 1996 Democratic conventionin Chicago, her friends told everyone (without irony) that one of theinjustices of the breakup event was that Patricia was forced to flycommercial back to New York .            I wish you would write about private planes. Really.  I could go onforever.            My ghastliest show-business moments were spent with Dustin Hoffman, but badas they were, there were nowhere near as bad as being told you've flunked anexam you haven't flunked and being forced to go to summer school (and, as theTimes notes today, being punished by your parents for flunking saidexam). The story in today's paper is truly horrible: These are kids withserious self-esteem issues anyway.            By the way, in today's Los Angeles Times is an article aboutKenneth Starr, who gave a speech here in which he admitted to some qualms abouthis career as a special prosecutor. The man is clearly looking for a job.            I have a rule about who wins the presidency, too. Mine is the person with 1)the most authenticity and 2) the biggest balls. This is why W. is so dangerous.And your remark about Jesse Ventura truly strikes fear into my heart. Althoughsomeone gave me his autobiography for my birthday, and I feel you could notpossibly have read it if you believe you could pull even the smallest lever forhim.
