                                 Tanks for Nothing                           USAToday , the Los Angeles Times , and the New York Times lead with Wednesday'sonset in Washington of the Israel-Syria peace talks. The Washington Post puts the talks above the fold but goesinstead with the continued Russia vs. Chechnya fighting in the Chechen capital,Grozny.            The Israel-Syria leads all describe the day starting with a Rose Gardenceremony in which President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, andSyrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara spoke. Clinton's and Barak's remarks werebrief and cordial, the papers agree, but then Shara used his remarks to tickoff at some length a list of Syria's grievances against Israel. The papers makeit clear that this soured the mood and created considerable awkwardness. Boththe LAT and the NYT make this point high up, while USATholds it for the penultimate paragraph. But, says the NYT , by the end ofthe day, after several hours of three-way talks, the atmosphere seemed muchimproved.            The WP and NYT report that a Russian armored column'spenetration into Grozny was met with strong resistance from Chechen rebels.Both papers, relying on a Reuters reporter on the scene, say the three-hourbattle left 100 Russian soldiers dead, with the NYT noting that thetotal Russian KIA in this year's Chechnya fighting before yesterday's battlewas 400. The LAT dispatch is more noncommittal about the battle, leavingthe clear impression that it had no eyes on the battlefield. Indeed, thecaption on the paper's front-page illustrated reefer to the battle story insidereads "RUSSIANS ROLL IN." The Wall Street Journal runs an AP dispatch stating that theChechens have "repulsed" Russian forces.                           USAT reports that the Federal Aviation Administration has reversed along-standing position with its announcement yesterday that it will requirespecial safety seats for small children traveling in airliners. The storydoesn't mention who will pay for these seats, the parents or the airlines, butit does say that under the new policy, the parents will probably be buying aseparate ticket for their toddlers, something they can avoid now by holdingthem. The story saves for the 10th paragraph the total number of unrestrainedbabies who've been killed in plane crashes in the past 20 years: two.            Everybody reports inside that yesterday, for the first time, formerDemocratic fund-raiser and Clinton administration Commerce Department officialJohn Huang testified before a committee of Congress. The papers report thatHuang denied that he had any part in channeling money from the Chinesegovernment to the Clinton-Gore '96 campaign but that he did admit to receiving$40,000 in "gift money" from James Riady, a wealthy Indonesian with ties toBill Clinton. The WP observes the hearing was poorly attended: out of 43committee members, only five Republicans and one Democrat were present.            Following up its report yesterday on a federal investigation of MTV'spossible restraint of trade, the WSJ reports that major music companies,including Sony and Time Warner, have talked with federal antitrust officialsabout settling allegations that they have illegally discouraged retailers fromdiscounting CDs.            An inside WP story details the extent of domestic drug production inthis country. According to information supplied by the Clinton administration'sdrug policy office, marijuana has become the No. 1 cash crop in poor areas ofKentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, while "speed" manufacturing is on theupswing in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa.            The WP and NYT report inside that Al Gore released a summary of his medical recordsyesterday, which indicate he's in "outstanding overall health for a 51-year-oldman." The only real risk factor revealed is that his cholesterol is borderlinehigh--231. Meanwhile, here are some of the questions from the WSJ onlineedition's candidate questionnaire that Bill Bradley "declined to answer": "Whatsingle figure has had the greatest influence on the development of your ownpolitical thinking?" "If you had to rely upon a single person as your foremosteconomic policy adviser, who would it be?" "If you had to rely upon a singleperson as your foremost foreign policy adviser, who would it be?" "Whatcontemporary American liberal do you most admire? Why?" "What is your favoritetelevision program?" "Which book that you've read this year has been mostimportant?" "What book (excepting the Bible) that you've ever read has beenmost important to you? Why?" "What is the best movie you've seen in the pastyear?" "What is the best movie you've ever seen?"
