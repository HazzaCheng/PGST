                                 The Sheepskin Game            The top national story at the Washington Post is the U.S. marshalling support amongallies as it heads into another stare-down with Iraq over arms inspectionaccess. The New York Timesleads with the decision of the Israeli Cabinet to make no further withdrawalsfrom the West Bank until the Palestinians satisfy a series of "stringent"conditions. The Los Angeles Times leads with the explosion in cable TVrates, and USA Today goes with the news that this country's rate ofinflation now stands at a 32-year low.            The WP reports that for now, the administration is, in the face ofthe latest Iraqi provocation--the blocking of a U.N. weapons search led by anAmerican, William Scott Ritter--opting for a cautious diplomatic path aimed atorchestrating a condemnation from the U.N. Security Council. The WP runsa profile of Ritter inside, revealing that he once rattledNorman Schwarzkopf by turning up evidence that the U.S. Gulf War air campaignhad not destroyed Iraqi mobile missile capabilities. The NYT front-pageIraq story features a top-of-the-page close-up photo of Ritter, and theLAT top-front effort is accompanied by a wider-angle shot of him.            The LAT reports that the FCC just issued a report showing thatcable rates are rising at four times the rate of inflation andthat in California and a few other states, subscribers are looking atdouble-digit price increases. None of the other dailies runs this story.            The Wall Street Journal reports that two-thirds of U.S.households have answering machines and that fully half of those use them toscreen incoming calls.            The LAT reports on its front page that the Asian economic crisis isaffecting Asian students, especially Thais and Koreans, attending college in this country. The piece has the example ofone USC junior packing to go back to Korea after getting a call from her momsaying that the currency collapse had in effect doubled the cost of tuition. Inaddition, states the paper, "Wealthier students from struggling Asian nationssay their parents have pleaded with them to tighten their belts or even sellthem, especially if they carry chic Coach or DKNY labels."            The WP front reports that Sen. John Glenn's interest in going backinto space on a NASA mission (first reported widely last summer) is still beingseriously considered at the agency. The paper says the answer will be no unlessNASA can produce a solid rationale. The decision about whether or not toinclude Glenn on a flight this October, says the Post , could comeanytime.                           Post TV critic Tom Shales takes a long backstage look at the meddling by NBC executives that led to the firing of NormMacDonald from "Saturday Night Live"'s Weekend Update anchor chair. Many peoplequoted in the story seem puzzled by the new level of interference from thesuits. One possible explanation Shales doesn't consider: Maybe NBC honcho andO.J. Simpson buddy Don Ohlmeyer wanted to punish MacDonald for all the O.J.gags he did on the segment over the years.            The 1/12 "Today's Papers" was mistaken when it credited the WP withbreaking that story about the Navy asking and AOL telling about a possibly gaysailor. The reason for the error was the Post 's shabby sourcing.Although the Post didn't mention it, the story had already appeared inthe San Francisco Chronicle , and before that in the on-line version ofthe NYT and (on the same day) at www.news.com and before that, in theHonolulu Star-Bulletin , which--for now--should be credited with thescoop. (Thanks to the many readers who helped fill out this backstory.)                           USAT runs a "talker" across the top of its front reporting that"Study Finds Highly Educated Have Less Sex." But the results, based on a surveyof 10,000 adults, aren't quite so straightforwardly anti-intellectual. It turnsout that there's sort of a sexual bubble: while people who've been to gradschool average 52 sex acts a year, and those who've only been through highschool average 59, folks who left school after college average 61.            Note: If most people live another fifty years after college and if collegecosts a total of more than $100,000, then the additional sex achieved bycollege students over their high school counterparts is purchased at HeidiFleiss rates: about $1,000 per.
