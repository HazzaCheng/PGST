                                 Fuzzy Logic            It is said that publishing is not a business but an art. Movie executivesare famous for knowing their box-office grosses, dollar for dollar, the dayafter the movie opens. Not book executives. "I'll call an editor and ask how aclient's book is selling, and he'll say 'Oh, gee, I don't know! Let me checkwith inventory," an agent told me recently. "But of course, all inventory cantell you--when inventory finally gets back to the editor, three days later--ishow many books have been ordered, not how many have been sold." Not until muchlater (as much as a year later), after bookstores have returned all theirunsold copies, can publishers compile firm sales figures. And even then, thenumbers are not particularly helpful. Did a book sell better in Topeka or SanDiego? In the spring or in the summer?            There are ways to answer those questions, but the book industry doesn't seemall that interested in the answers. Bookscan, for instance, is a system madeand marketed by Soundscan, the company that brings you the music industry'sgreatest-hits charts. Soundscan gets its numbers from a scanning deviceinstalled at checkout counters at more than 85 percent of all music outlets inAmerica. Bookscan is trying to put a similar gizmo into bookstores. So far, ithasn't caught on. Unlike Soundscan, which swept swiftly through the musicbusiness after it was introduced, when Bookscan was unveiled last year, it wasdismissed by the American Association of Publishers, whose official line on itwas that it was too expensive. (Publishers would have to pay Bookscan for thedata.)            Was that the real reason it was rejected? Publishers could have comeback to Bookscan and said, we like your product but want you to bring yourprice down. You'd think they'd be eager to learn whether local or nationaladvertising works better, or whether book tours do anything other than strokeauthorial egos. Culturebox doesn't know how much Bookscan was charging, butwonders whether publishers really factored in the savings they'd accrue frombetter-targeted marketing.            Culturebox asked around and came up with a few other theories of whypublishing is one of the last industries to seek the comfort of hardnumbers:            1. Editors don't want to know exactly how well their books are selling. Itmight force them to stop buying the kinds of books they love publishing--theserious books with limited sales. A corollary to this theory is that publishersdon't want the world to see how small the unit sales are for even world-famousauthors (they usually linger under 50,000)--it might make the whole industryseem a lot less glamorous.            2. Hard sales data might eliminate a cash hoard publishers have secured forthemselves. It turns out that most contracts between authors and publishersallow publishers to withhold as much of 40 percent of royalties againstpossible returns during the first year of publication (and as much as 60percent for paperbacks). Precise point-of-sale data would obviate that clause,and force publishers to fork over all royalties right away.            3. The big chains have been quietly going into the business of compilingbook sales data themselves--an obvious thing to do, given their dominance ofthe retail market--and don't want to give up what amounts to a competitiveadvantage. This may explain why, so far, Bookscan has not cut deals with any ofthe big chains (though they are talking to them). Also, if publishers aregetting the numbers for free from the chains, why pay for them?            Whatever the reason, publishers are making it clear that what they want morethan anything is to keep their sales figures secret. A Soundscan executive toldCulturebox this week that one change it had made to Bookscan in response topublishers' concerns was to turn it into a "closed system." In other words, thedata will not be published and no one but the publisher of a book will be ableto learn its hard sales figures. (Soundscan, by contrast, is an "open system.")Expect industrywide numbers to remain fuzzy in the foreseeable future.            -- Judith Shulevitz
