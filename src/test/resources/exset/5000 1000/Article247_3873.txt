                                 Shattering Glass-Steagall            The Washington Post leads with a House Republican plan to cutGovernment spending across-the-board by 1.4 percent. The Republicans contendthat cutting $4.5 billion from federal agencies and delaying $1.3 billion inhealth spending will fill the hole in their budget. Administration officialsargue that the Republican plan does not add up and that the proposal wouldforce layoffs and harm military readiness. House Majority Leader Richard Armey(R-Tex.) explained his vision of how the Defense Department could cut 1.4percent from its $260 billion budget: "Instead of having two colonels to holdyour paper, you'll have only one major." The NYT and the LATcarry the story inside.            The New York Times and theLosAngeles Times lead with the product of decades of debate and intensivelobbying--an agreement to transform American banking laws.            Democrats and Republicans resolved to repeal the Depression-eraGlass-Steagall law, which restricted the cross-ownership of banks, brokerages,and insurers. If the accord is enacted, a NYT analysis forecasts thatfinancial institutions will agglomerate into "universal banks" to provideone-stop financial shopping. Consumers could benefit from reduced costs. TheLAT notes that the bill will prohibit nonfinancial companies from buyingbanks.            Even though Senate Republicans acceded to a Democratic provision that willprevent banks with unsatisfactory lending records from moving into otherfinancial services, advocates for disadvantaged borrowers argue that theagreement fails to strengthen fair lending laws. Yesterday, the WP wasable to squeeze early news of the 2 a.m. agreement into a late edition. Today,the story is the Post 's off-lead. All papers report that the stockmarket soared over 172.5 points on news of the accord.            The LAT fronts a United Nations Security Council vote to send 6,000peacekeepers to Sierra Leone. A NYT story explains that the peacekeeperswill disarm Sierra Leone rebels. The United States will contribute logisticalsupport to the operation, but no combat troops. On Monday, the Security Councilis expected to approve sending 10,000 U.N. troops to East Timor. The newcommitments will double the number of peacekeepers in the field. The U.N. isalso considering sending as many as 20,000 peacekeepers to the Congo.            The Post fronts Russia's acceptance and disavowal ofresponsibility for the bombing of a Chechen market. The incident cost over 100lives. Among the dead are women and children. A Russian military spokesman saidthat special forces bombed the market because it was actually an arms bazaar.But Russian Prime Minster Vladimir Putin claimed that the explosion was causedby warring Chechen rebels. The NYT and LAT carry the storyinside. All papers assert that evidence points towards a Russian bombardment.According to the New York Times , as violence spreads Chechens arefleeing into the neighboring republic of Ingushetia, where it is estimated that185,000 civilians are seeking refuge.            All the papers bury their coverage of the New Hampshire debate amongcontenders for the Republican presidential nomination. The NYT says thatthe five candidates "virtually ignored" front-runner George W. Bush and focusedon criticizing Bill Clinton. The WP asserts that after the debate thefive attending politicians blasted Bush by arguing that his absence from thestage was an affront to voters. "I think he was the big loser here tonight,"Steve Forbes said of the absent Bush. (                  Slate               's Jacob Weisberg analyzes the debate and highlights its strangermoments.)            A NYT piece reports on a particularly creative Internet start-up.RonsAngels.com, the brainchild of former Playboy director Ron Harris, auctionsthe eggs of fashion models to the highest bidder (presumably infertilecouples.) Even though the site will not premiere until Monday, Ron has alreadyreceived a $42,000 bid for one of his angel's eggs. Some ethicists are troubledby the combination of e-commerce, eugenics and egg pimping.
