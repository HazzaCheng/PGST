                                 The First Amendment Works in Cyberspace Too                        Having read Larry's valedictory, I amimpressed more with his plaintive, rhetorical ploys than his substantiveargument. It is not that he is a failed teacher who cannot convey the soundmessage to a slow student. It is that he is a skilled teacher, or at leastadvocate, who has tried to sell an alarmist message that just does not addup.            The first problem that I see is that Larry cannot distinguish between achange and a problem. Of course the proprietary systems will loom larger on theInternet with the rise of commerce. But that makes sense for most people. Ifthe system turns out to be filled with folks who plant traps along the way,there are responses to deal with them, whether they are the next generation ofcookies or the old bait-and-switch techniques. We have rules that regulate thefull-time surveillance of other individuals on land, and these can be carriedover to the Net as needed. And should we worry if the ACLU and the Christianright have their gates to filter information? Yes, if they can impose theirwill on individuals who do not join in their cause; but no if the service isrequested and disclosed in advance. But whether it is done online or in person,it does not count as censorship (or at least censorship worthy of scorn) ifrequested by the individual in question. Larry seems to think that public andprivate controls are the same, but they are not, at least when the privateareas give choices and allow for new entry.            The second problem that I see with Larry's approach is that he assumes thatthere is some selective, legal void in cyberspace. Take one of his examples. IfI give my information to Site 1, and then it is transfered without my consentto an affiliated site, that could well amount to a breach of duty that exposesthe operators of both sites to serious liabilities. Just think of the roar thatwent up when it was found out that some public radio stations gave their listsout only to Democrats for recruitment purposes. We could protest with the sameintensity for illicit sharing that takes place over the Net.            Larry thinks that the old Net had this virtue, that "it embedded,architecturally, a First Amendment." He laments that the new one does not. Butit is not as though once we shift to a partly restricted Net that FirstAmendment claims cannot be brought against governments that seek to regulatethe Net in ways they could not regulate other media. So here Larry tells usthat "it becomes possible for local governments to begin to impose regulationon people on the Net, by forcing local servers to condition access based on thefeatures of who people are." But the painfully obvious answer is, not if thatkind of restriction violates the First Amendment. The state could not conditionthe power of a newspaper to sell its paper on the willingness to sell itssubscriber list, so why here?            Let's be clear about one thing. My position is not that government can do nowrong on the Net, or that private firms can do no right. My view is that thestandard set of legal techniques, from contract to legislation toconstitutional protection, carry over well to this new environment, even afterit ceases to be organized as vast public space, as it was at its outset.Markets survive only if individuals value what they get for more than it costs.They require government protection of property rights to work well. Butgovernments can abuse their powers and should be subject to constitutionalchecks. All agreed. But nothing about the Internet, no special brand ofcyberspace liberty, changes these fundamental relationships and the problemsthey pose. The reason it is so difficult to come to grips with what Larry saysis that his threats are diffuse and often hypothetical. His down-to-earthanalogies are more instructive and less alarmist, because they do not ignorethe sensible constitutional, political, and market counterstrategies that areavailable. Of course there will be problems on the Net, just as there will beproblems in any space to which any of have to venture. No one should bePangloss, or Cassandra. Au revoir .
