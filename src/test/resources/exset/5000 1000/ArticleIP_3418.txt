                                 Tea With the Local Saint            By J.D.McClatchy                           (posted Wednesday,March 18)                        To hear the poet read "TeaWith the Local Saint," click .            I'd bought a cone of solidsugar and a boxOf tea for the saint himself, a felt-tip penFor his son, thesaint-elect, and bubblegumFor a confusion of small fry--the five-year-oldAunt,say, and her seven-year-old nephew.Nothing for the women, of course, thetattooed,One-eyed, moon-faced matron, or her daughterWhose husband had long agorun awayAfter killing their newborn by pouringA bottle of cheap cologne downits throat.This was, after all, our first meeting.            I was to be introduced bya Peace Corps palWhose easy, open California waysHad brought a water system tothe villageAnd an up-to-date word to its vocabulary.Every other gutturalspillway of ArabicIncluded a carefully enunciated "awesome,"The speakerbright-eyed with his own banter.We sat on a pair of Kurt Cobain beach towelsAndunder a High-Quality Quartz Clock,The plastic butterflies attached to whosehandsSeemed to keep time with those in my stomach.            At last, he entered theroom, the saint himself,Moulay Madani, in a white head scarf and caftanThefading blue of a map's Moroccan coastline,Its hem embroidered with geometricports of call.A rugged sixty, with a longshoreman's jaw,A courtier's guile, anda statesman's earnest pauses,He first explained the crescent dagger hefingeredHad been made two centuries ago by a clever Jew.Then he squinted for myreaction. I've no tasteFor bad blood, and gingerly cleared my throat to sayIwas inclined to trust any saint who carried a knife.            From a copper urn, glassesof mint tea were poured,Of a tongue-stiffening sweetness. I was allowed towaveAway the tray of nougat--or rather, the flies on it.Sipping, I waited for aword, a sign from the saint.I'd wanted to lie, as if underground, and watch Himdig up the sky, or stand at a riverbankAnd have the water sweep off mypresumptions,Have him blow light into my changeling bones.I wanted to feel thestalk rise and the blade fall.I wanted my life's arithmetic glazed and fired.Iwanted the hush, the wingstroke, the shudder.            But sainthood, I learnedsoon enough, is a fateWorse than life, nights on call for the demonsIn avomiting lamb, a dry breast, a broken radio,And days spent parroting thetimeless adages,Spent arbitrating water rights, property lines,Or feuds betweenrival herdsmen over scrub brush,Spent blessing every bride and anyone'sbig-belliedFourth or fifth wife, praying that they deliver sons.I thought backto the time, not ten feet from him,I heard a homily delivered by old JohnXXIII,Sounding wholly seraphic in his murmured Italian.            Ten interpreters steppedfrom behind the throne.The English one at last explained the Holy FatherHadurged us all to wear seatbelts while driving.My heart sank at its plain goodsense, as hymnsEchoed and golden canopies enfolded the pope,How like home itseemed, with my own fatherA preoccupied patriarch of practicalityWhen what waswanted veered wildly betweenThe gruff headmaster and the drunkenplaywright.Instead, I got the distant advertising salesman,The suburban dad ofwhat turned out to be my dreams ...            Dreams that, decadeslater, back at my hotel in Fez,A bucket of cold water was suddenly pouredon.I'd gone to the hammam, stripped, and lay on a patternOf sopping tiles thatmight have spelled God's will.Steam shrouded the attendant methodicallysoapingThe knots of disappointment he'd knuckled in my back.He paused. Idrifted [ The freezing shock. ] I looked upAt a bald, toothless gnome inswaddling clothesOn his way back to the fountain for more bad news.Something inhis bowlegged walk--perhaps the wearyRoutine of it--made me think of the saintagain,            Of how, whentea was done, and everyone had stood,He reached for my head, put his hands overit,And gently pulled me to his chest, which smelledOf dung smoke and cinnamonand mutton grease.I could hear his wheezy breathing now, like the prophet'sLast whispered word repeated by the faithful.Then he prayed for what no one hadtime to translate--His son interrupted the old man to tell him a groupOf snakecharmers sought his blessing, and a blind thief.The saint pushed me away, tookone long look,Then straightened my collar and nodded me toward the door.
