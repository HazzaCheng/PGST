                                 Veep Veep Beta Veep            All the papers except the New York Times lead with the recovery of a large piece ofwreckage from EgyptAir flight 990 and the discovery of an electronic beaconpossibly emitted by its cockpit voice or data recorder (this story also topsthe Wall StreetJournal 's "Worldwide" box).  The NYT fronts this story but leads with a federal judge's order to New York Mayor RudolphGiuliani to restore funding to the Brooklyn Museum, a story fronted by theLos AngelesTimes . Citing First Amendment violations, the judge issued a temporaryinjunction against the city, which said it will appeal and also fight themuseum's efforts to make the injunction permanent.Many air crash stories are filled with airy nothings. "The large questions ...remained unanswered," the NYT informs us. "Like many aspects of the early investigation,numerous facts begged for interpretation and elaboration ... but no immediateconclusions were forthcoming from officials. ... In an inquiry that willundoubtedly produce many leads, an intriguing one surfaced Monday" about apossible suitcase tampering. But two paragraphs later, the Times notesthat officials "were not attaching much significance to the lead." TheJournal does note that the Boeing 767 has an excellent safetyrecord.            The NYT off-leads the behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the Clintonadministration to admit China into the World Trade Organization by Nov. 30,when President Clinton hosts a world trade meeting in Seattle. Clinton walkedaway from a similar deal in April but restarted negotiations with a call toChinese Prime Minister Jiang Zemin "late on the night of October 16." The"secret exchanges" since then are intended to consummate 16 years of Americanefforts to include China in GATT and its successor, the WTO (which sets theterms for world trade). The Washington Post fronts a story chronicling the preparationsof the tens of thousands of WTO critics expected to protest in Seattle. Aseparate Post story notes that the House put off voting on a bill to strengthenTaiwan-American military relations in deference to the negotiations withChina.            The LAT fronts--and the NYT , WP , and USA Today reefer--the deathat 45 of football great Walter Payton. Payton, who had bile duct cancer, wasthe National Football League's all-time leading rusher. All the obituaries notehis legendary training regimen and brute strength, packed into a 5' 10'',204-pound frame. At age 23 he rushed for 275 yards in a game, a league record,and received the first of two MVP awards.            The Post fronts a long history of Bill Bradley's military service.Unlike Clinton, Bradley did not nurture a strong political opposition to theVietnam War (eventually he grew cautiously opposed). Also unlike Clinton,Bradley soberly accepted his duty to serve by enlisting in the Air ForceReserves. The Post says he secured an extremely rare reservistposition (they numbered in the hundreds)--one which allowed him to tailor hismilitary schedule to Knicks games. Although he discovered the position throughtips from military friends, the Post reveals that Bradley'sapplication did not get special treatment from military personnel and that hespecifically asked the Knicks not to lobby on his behalf. Bradley's choices,the Post notes, "display characteristics that recurred often in hispublic life: foresight, circumspection, and skill at finding advantage whileadhering strictly to the rules."            Both the NYT and WSJ opinion pages run critiques of thecountry's rush to judgment on airline disasters. "An event with aone-in-a-million chance of happening to any American on any given day will, infact, occur 260 times each day in this country," notesmathematician John Allen Paulos ( NYT ), who argues that the EgyptAircrash was almost certainly a random event. (Read Paulos' "Breakfast Table"dispatches here.)And Barry Glassner writes in the Journal that most differences insafety records between airlines have been shown to be statisticallyinsignificant. Nevertheless, the Post runs a story detailing the (mixed) accident history ofEgyptAir. (To read Michael Kinsley on our irrational fear of flying, clickhere.)                           Post columnist Richard Cohen predicts the release of Al Gore, Version 2.0: Alpha Male."Do not be surprised if, someday soon, you hear Gore growl. Do not be surprisedif, at some Rose Garden event, he bares his teeth at Clinton or--in a suitselected by [Naomi] Wolf--sniffs him. He may even come up to him and challengehim to arm wrestle. No one has ever done that to a president before--not in anolive green suit, anyway. This will surely win Gore the respect, admiration,and sighs of countless Americans."
