                                 Brave Newt World            After Today's Papers: International Papers provides the low-down on overseascoverage of the war crimes tribunal, Mandela's birthday, and Queen Elizabeth'srising stature in Fiji. The New York Times ,Washington Post , and Los AngelesTimes lead with a story that's already made the rounds once thissummer--the Nigerian military leader's promise that his country will return todemocratic civilian rule. What's new is that on Monday he said this wouldhappen by May 29, 1999. USA Today also goes with a moldy oldy: It's hot. The onlyreally new heat news, on the LAT front and inside at the WP , isthat the Border Patrol is carrying out search-and-rescue missions to saveillegal immigrants who court heat death while trying to sneak into the U.S.from Mexico. In New Orleans, according to the Post , President Clintonsaid the summer swelter proved global warming.            The NYT reports that Nigeria's Gen. Abubakar apparently bowed tomilitary hawks in not agreeing to hand over power by October 1 to civilianauthority. (The NYT doesn't explain the significance of the date, butthe LAT does--it's Nigerian Independence Day.) But in a televisedspeech, he said he would release all political prisoners jailed by the previousmilitary regime, allow the formation of political parties, reform the prisonsystem and put an end to "lapses" in the management of public funds. Thespeech, says the Times , was intended to reassure Western governments.And Abubakar is clearly making the transition to Western political values--hesummed up his predecessor's reign of corruption and false imprisonment thus:"mistakes have been made."            The Wall Street Journal runs a front-page feature on anemerging force in Asian journalism, China's weekly Southern Weekend . Thepaper started out entertainment-oriented but under the leadership of itsWestern-oriented and literate editor, it has grown in circulation andprofitability as it moved from celebrity news and salacious scandals to realinvestigative reporting. Recent stories: thefts of antiquities during ahigh-profile government dam project, and false murder convictions. And, reportsthe Journal , the paper is changing the shape of Chinese media. In fact,last month a government paper launched its own copycat.            Additional perspective on the press comes in a NYTop-ed written by a Peruvian journalist, Gustavo Gorriti, who notes that inLatin America, journalists are often the only check on government abuse ofpower and, as a result, are generally viewed very positively. One reason forthis, the author says, is that the American principles of thoroughness, factchecking and the separation between editors and publishers have profoundlyinfluenced Latin journalists. Which leads Gorriti to wonder: What happened tothese values in American newsrooms? His answer: Conglomerates swallowing upmedia properties, the rush to do "impact news" of the Lewinsky sort, and"relentless greed for prizes."            Arianna Huffington's LAT column connects the two most consumingscandal stories of the 90s. If the "perjury epidemic" is to be checked, then,she says, the perjury cases involving President Clinton (who denied under oathhaving had sex with Monica) and O.J. Simpson (who denied under oath havingbeaten Nicole) must be pursued to their respective ends.            The most disturbing thing "Today's Papers" has read on the job yet was inSunday's LAT , which published an interview with a teenaged boy, DavidCash, who apparently learned right after the fact that his friend had murdereda seven-year-old girl in a Las Vegas casino bathroom and yet did nothing.LAT : "Were you appalled that a friend said he killed a little girl?"Cash: "I'm not going to get upset over somebody else's life. I just worry aboutmyself first. I'm not going to lose sleep over somebody else's problems."            Following up its story yesterday about Big Tobacco's propensity for flyingRepublican members of Congress around, today's WP passes along theresults of a Center for Responsive Politics study of the free travelaccepted by members (it's still legal as long as it relates tocongressional business). The chief finding: Corporations, trade groups and thelike spent $6.4 million last year on trips for members, their spouses, andtheir staffs. The member accepting the most free travel--over $44,000worth--was Newt Gingrich. Gingrich also had the single most expensive freetrip--a four-day jaunt to London that cost Atlantic Richfield $33,000. Askedabout Gingrich's $12,000 hotel bill at London's posh Claridge's, an aide offersthe Post this explanation: "Arco selected the hotel."
