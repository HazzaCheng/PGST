                                 Murphy's Law: A Chatterbox Investigation            The death of Air Force Capt. John Paul Stapp, who during the 1940s and '50sallowed his body to be used in various experiments testing the effects ofhigh-speed transportation, provides an occasion to consider how Murphy's Lawcame into being. The New York Times ' obituary of Stapp, who died Nov. 13 at the ripe age of 89, tellsit this way:                                             Stapp, who was known for his razor-sharp wit, suffered an injury in theexperiment that inspired Murphy's Law, after a ... rapid sled ride in1949.                              An assistant, Capt. Edward Murphy Jr., had designed a harness to strap therider in. The harness held 16 sensors to measure the acceleration, or G-force,on different parts of the body. There were exactly two ways each sensor couldbe installed. Murphy did each one the wrong way.               The result was that when Stapp staggered off the rocket sled with bloodshoteyes and bleeding sores, all the sensors registered zero. He had beenrestrained in vain.               A distraught Murphy proclaimed the original version of the famous maxim: "Ifthere are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in acatastrophe, then someone will do it that way."                        But a 1978 article by Ted Bear, then a flight-center historian atEdwards Air Force Base in California, where the experiment in question tookplace, tells it this way:                                             [Murphy's Law] was named after Capt. Edward A. Murphy, an engineerworking on Air Force Project MX981, [a project] designed to see how much suddendeceleration a person can stand in a crash.                              One day, after finding that a transducer was wired wrong, he cursed thetechnician responsible and said, "If there is any way to do it wrong, he'llfind it."                        Both versions of the story have the same basic theme, which is that it'salways good to be prepared for lots of things going wrong. But in theTimes version, Capt. Murphy's comment seems to be an exercise inevading blame . Rather than saying, "Gosh, I'm sorry," Capt. Murphy isattributing his                own screw-up to some larger cosmic tendency forall things to get screwed up. It's the engineering equivalent of thefamiliar political dodge, "mistakes were made." By contrast, in Bear's version,Capt. Murphy is attaching blame to someone else . Murphy is more or lesscalling the technician said to be responsible (we never get thetechnician's version) a schmuck . In Bear's version, Murphy is notstating any broad philosophical principle of any kind. If this is thereal version--for what it's worth, Capt. Leah M. Bryant told the storythe same way in the Sept. 1997 issue of Leading Edge , the house organ ofthe Air Force Materiel Command--then Murphy's Law was completely misconstrued.In other words, Murphy's Law is itself an illustration of Murphy's Law.(Neither the Times version nor the Bear/Bryant version is particularlyflattering to Capt. Murphy.)            To make matters even more confusing, there's a third version of thestory involving an entirely different Murphy--not Capt. EdwardMurphy, but Commander (later Admiral ) Joseph M. "Murph"Murphy. Chatterbox was unable to obtain details of this story, but "Murph"Murphy is the person to whom Edward H. Heinemann, an aircraft designer andengineer for Douglas Aircraft in the 1940s and '50s, attributes Murphy's Law inhis (Heinemann's) 1980 autobiography, Ed Heinemann: Combat Aircraft Designer . Chatterboxgot the poop on "Murph" Murphy from Fred Johnsen, the historian at the EdwardsAir Force Flight Test Center. Johnsen told Chatterbox that Heinemann onceshowed him "Murph" Murphy's photograph and said, "That's the guy who inventedMurphy's Law." Johnsen said that while Heinemann spent a lot of time atEdwards, he has no reason to think that "Murph" Murphy had any connection toEdwards at all.            "There are several reputable people in the aeronautic industry who claim tohave known Murphy, and it's a different Murphy in each case," Johnsen toldChatterbox regretfully. At least, Chatterbox thinks that's what Johnsensaid ...
