                                 Sense and Inessentiality                        Dear Dad,            That was a lovely letter. A long time ago you talked to me about Britishobituaries, and since then, when I've had time, I've tried to read the obituarypage of the Daily Telegraph . After getting your message, I went back toit on the Web, and saw again what you mean about the differences from Americanobits. Here's something from last Friday, from a short notice written by thepoet P.J. Kavanagh about his late brother-in-law, Lord Milford: "He could nothelp having a creative laugh: unfeigned, joyous, it made you feel much funnierthan you thought you were, which is among the kindest of social gifts." I can'timagine an American newspaper printing an obituary with a sentence like this,which might certainly help get readers through a cold day. There's a certaindelight in the inessential things in life which is one of the most pleasantthings about British (and also Irish) culture. I suppose it's one reason whypoetry remains so much more of a vital force in Britain and Ireland than inAmerica, for what is poetry if not inessential?            Tony Blair, of course, doesn't seem to have much time for the inessential.His Britain has to be dynamic, forward-thrusting, fully charged. In this, heresembles no one so much as Margaret Thatcher, whose attitude toward theinessential was one of brusque, snarling contempt. Speaking as an American,this trend in British politics is something I deplore, and my opinion has onlybeen strengthened by reading British authors like John Mortimer (of Rumpoleof the Bailey fame), and magazines like the Spectator , which havemade a fetish out of the British attitude toward inessential things. Long livefox-hunting, the House of Lords, High Table and High Church and High Tea, HorseGuards and public schools and the royal family! But as a historian, I can'tresist remarking that the cultivation of the inessential is a trademark ofaristocratic societies (aristocrats deliberately spend their time on trifles toshow that they can , and others can't), and that as charming as itappears to outsiders, most native members of the society are unlikely to be sowell disposed, since the burden of the aristocracy falls on their shoulders.And having seen one of the famous public schools at rather too close quartersback when I was 14, during your sabbatical year in London, I think that if Iwere British, I'd be more likely to approach those charming and inessentialaspects of British society with a box of explosives than with theSpectator 's pious reverence (and on the Speccie in particular,you'll remember Ian Buruma's devastating account of the place in his bookAnglomania ).            But back to the news. The most amusing thing I saw in the paper yesterdaywas that a man legally named DotComGuy (formerly, Mitch Maddox), is going tomove into an empty house carrying only a credit card on January 1 and not leaveagain for the entire year, relying exclusively on the Internet for furniture,food, services and entertainment. His Web site claims that he will spend theyear "living inside the Internet," as if this were some great foray into newand unexplored regions of cyberspace. Talk about being behind the curve! Ithink the real challenge for a currently employed middle-class professionaltoday would be to spend a year living entirely outside the Internet: noe-mail, no eToys or E*Trade or Amazon, no MP3s or game demos, no online bankingor selection of benefits through the company intranet, not to mention, ofcourse, no                   Slate               . I don't think I'd survive for more than a fewdays (which is why your daughter-in-law, alas, once referred to herself as a"wwww", for "world wide web widow"). You may have a different opinion, notbeing anywhere near as much a regular user of the Web as I am. But then again,here you are, in                   Slate               : the public intellectual as contentprovider for Microsoft.
