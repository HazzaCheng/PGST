                                 Union Dues and Don'ts            The New York Times leads with anexclusive: extensive corruption in the nation's second-largest union, theAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, based on aninternal union document. The Washington Post goes with the D.C. government's decision tofollow the example of numerous other cities by filing a multimillion-dollarlawsuit against the nation's major handgun manufacturers and distributors.USAToday leads with fresh polling indicating that despite close races inthe Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, both Al Gore and George W.Bush have "huge" leads among voters nationwide. The poll shows that amonglikely voters, Bush beats Gore decisively and beats Bradley too, although byless of a margin. And McCain beats each of the two Democrats as well. The topnon-local story at the Los Angeles Times is the expected announcement today byPresident Clinton that his proposed budget will include a $3 billion increaseover last year in federal science funding.            The NYT says the union report describes corrupt activities by 35union officials, mostly misappropriation of union funds, totaling $4.6 million.A particularly disturbing note: The paper quotes the union's general counsel assaying it is "cleaner than most unions." It should be noted that theTimes says high up in its story that the report was "made available by aunion official eager to have the federation take a tougher stance oncorruption." This exemplifies the paper's admirable general policy when dealingwith unnamed sources of at least communicating to the reader the source'smotivation and personal connection to the story.            The WP lead notes that municipal anti-gun suits have suffered aseries of legal setbacks recently, with judges throwing out several of them.Another obstacle, explains the Post , is unique to D.C.: Congress, whichoverseas the city's budget, can step in to prevent the funding of a lawsuit.And, indeed, the story goes on to quote Rep. Bob Barr calling the action"utterly frivolous." But still, the paper reminds, between 1992 and 1998, gunswere used in more than 2,000 D.C. homicides.            The two Times front yesterday's Jesse Helms U.N. visit/speech. Helms'gist was that Congress has the right to dictate conditions that must befulfilled by the organization before it receives U.S. dues. The main conditionHelms seemed to have in mind was for the U.N. not to impose its "utopian"vision on America. Even so, the reporting shows that Helms--said by theNYT to be the most powerful foreign policy voice in Congress--had muchmore productive contact with Security Council officials yesterday than he'dever had before.            The LAT and WP fronts report a rather striking sign that theRussian assault on Chechnya is in disarray: A senior Russian general leadingforces attempting to capture Grozny is missing in action. The Chechen rebels say that he has beencaptured alive. The LAT explains that the rebels are making this claimon their Web site. And the paper is to be commended for including the URL,which is http://www.kavkaz.org. The NYT mentions the Web site inanother connection, but doesn't give out the address. What's up with that?            The NYT and WP front the German parliament's launch of afull-scale investigation into the financial dealings of former ChancellorHelmut Kohl and the political party he led for 25 years, and the Los AngelesTimes puts it at the top of its front-page world-wide news index. TheLAT reefers the news. The WP 's headline makes no mention of atragic turn--the apparent suicide death of the party's finance chief. And, hey,how come nobody fronts the similar investigatory ratchet-up in a similarfinancial scandal involving Israel's longtime president?            The WSJ goes high in its front-page financial news box with therecord U.S. trade deficit posted for November, which it attributes to higherimports of cars and other consumer goods as well as Y2K stockpiling and risingoil prices. Everybody else stuffs this.            The WP reports that the search for bodies of victims of Mexicandruglords along the Mexico-Texas border has ended after having yielded ninecorpses--on Page 22. Contrast this to the front-page treatment accorded by manyof the dailies to the first stories claiming that there might be more than 100bodies at the site.            A front-page WSJ feature celebrates the return to fashionability ofthe mustache. The story doesn't note one quarter in which upper lip layeringseems permanently out of fashion: presidential candidates. What possibleexplanation is there for no presidential mustache since Taft? Another challengefor Jesse Ventura.
