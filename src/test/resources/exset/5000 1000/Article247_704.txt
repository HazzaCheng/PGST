                                 German Kohl Cuts            The LosAngeles Times and New York Timeslead with the German election results, in which Gerhard Schroeder defeated16-year chancellor Helmut Kohl, a story that makes everybody's front. USA Todayleads with the Gulf Coast arrival of Hurricane Georges. The big concern, saysUSAT , is the flooding that is likely when the storm hits New Orleans,where tens of thousands of residents have taken shelter in such locales as theSuperdome and the convention center. The Washington Post leads with Mark McGwire's final total of 70home runs, achieved via his second straight two-HR game, a story that getstop-of-the-page-with-picture coverage everywhere.            The LAT says that "Schroeder's policies differ little from those ofKohl--and his election expressed a hunger for a new face more than a newdirection." The NYT sees a bigger difference, saying that while Kohl campaigned onGermany's rise from Nazism and its role in Europe, Schroeder talked about jobs.The paper says that strategy worked because Germans are "tired of historylessons" and concerned that their society is fraying. The WP cites boththe "new face" and unemployment angles.            Schroeder's Social Democratic Party polled 41 percent of the vote, but willstill need, note the papers, to enter into a coalition with another party inparliament to rule Germany. One possibility mentioned is that the SDP will hookup with the left-leaning/enviro Greens. Both Times mention that theGreens have long opposed the current NATO set-up. The LAT adds that anysuch coalition would have to worry about radical Greens bolting. Anotherdevelopment: the successor to the Communist Party gained parliamentary strengthin the vote. The LAT says the numbers are such that Schroeder doesn'thave to enter an alliance with the neo-Communists. The NYT says he haspromised not to. There is one other recurring difference in the papers' Germanycoverage: all but the NYT render the winner's name "Schroeder," whilethe Ochs Sulzberger bund foregoes that "oe" for an "o" under an umlaut.            The sort of story that, post-Monica, has been far too scarce appears todayon the LAT front: the paper's long-time defense business reporter RalphVartabedian reports that new government information out today shows that thePentagon still can't protect itself against embezzlement and overpayment.According to the story, there have been a dozen cases of DOD embezzlement inrecent years, featuring such dodges as clerks creating fictitious contracts andthen honoring them--with checks to themselves. One case in the story: an AirForce sergeant who arranged for his wife and mother to receive more $900,000.The three accountants who tried to alert authorities to this were...removedfrom their jobs. The LAT says Pentagon financial controls have gottenweaker under the Clinton administration "reinvention of government." Of course,the paper should have mentioned that this hardly counts against the idea ofstreamlining bureaucracy--it only shows that not all reinventions are equallygood ones.            The WP reports that with less than two weeks before the federalgovernment runs out of money, twelve of the thirteen spending bills remainunsigned. The Post says that getting very little attention beneath allthe Monica mayhem are special provisions that have added billions to thedefense bill, and hundreds of millions to the veterans and housing bill and tothe energy bill, to name a few. But the paper is rather stinting on details,compared to say, its coverage of dress stains, and runs the story on page4.            A Wall Street Journal front-page feature explores aworrisome unintended consequence of the pesticide strictures in the food safetylaw passed two years ago: to ensure compliance, some top pesticidemanufacturers have resumed testing their products on people, a practice that, although legal,they'd abandoned in the early 1980s. In the U.S. and Britain, scores ofvolunteers are now swallowing small doses of toxic pesticides. Sometimes, thepaper reports, test subjects are told that they are ingesting a "drug" not apesticide.            The Post reports that a Democratic congressional candidate inWisconsin has formulated and signed an "affidavit of integrity" declaring that"he has never: committed adultery; abused his wife or children; engaged inhomosexual activity; experimented with illegal drugs; or been charged with orconvicted of a felony." Hey, where's the cigar clause?
