                                 Sterility: What Did He Think, When Did He Think It            Perhaps the most puzzling element to Juanita Broaddrick's story, as relatedon the editorial page of the Feb. 18 Wall Street Journal , is her claimthat after Bill Clinton allegedly raped her in 1978, "he looked down at her andsaid not to worry, he was sterile--he had had mumps when he was a child." (See"ProvingRape," "MoreProving Rape," and "Even MoreProving Rape." ) Subsequent events (e.g., the birth of Chelsea Clinton)suggest that if Clinton did say this, he was lying. That wouldn't domuch to prove or disprove Broaddrick's rape accusation, but it's mildlyinteresting to think about in the context of what we know about Clinton'smendacity.            It may be, however, that (assuming he really said it) Clinton reallydid think in 1978 that he was sterile. In 1996 James B. Stewart, aformer writer and editor on the Wall Street Journal 's news staff,published a book about the various Clinton scandals called Blood Sport . On pages 66, 80, and 81 of the hardcoveredition, Stewart reports that in 1978 the Clintons were "trying to conceive. Itseemed to be a subject of considerable anxiety for Hillary, who worried outloud to a few close friends that she might find it impossible to becomepregnant because of a medical condition." Although that sentence seems to implyit was Hillary who was presumed to have the "medical condition," Stewartdoesn't really say. If it was Bill who was thought sterile, conceivablythe couple wouldn't have wanted to admit that even to close friends, because hewas running for governor at the time in a campaign that emphasized his youthand vigor. According to Stewart's account, the Clintons continued to fret abouttheir ability to have children, and the following year even considered visitinga fertility doctor at the University of California at San Francisco. But thenHillary learned she was pregnant--famously, while they were in London,prompting Bill Clinton to sing, while strolling through Chelsea, JoniMitchell's "Chelsea Morning."            So: Maybe Bill Clinton really did think he was sterile when heallegedly raped Juanita Broaddrick. That tells us Broaddrick had access to afairly intimate detail about Bill Clinton's sex life--which she might havegotten 1) after being raped by Bill Clinton; 2) before or after havingconsensual sex with Bill Clinton; or 3) while reading Blood Sport .            Chatterbox is ready to concede that there is a little more evidencesupporting Broaddrick's story than there was when the Journal editorialpage broke it. In addition to the sterility business, there are, as previouslynoted here, three additional witnesses who say Broaddrick told them of the rapeback in 1978. (This was reported by NBC, which the Journal editorialpage, writing before the NBC interview aired, accused of expending too mucheffort trying to check out Broaddrick's story.) There are also PresidentClinton's suspiciously sullen, give-no-more-details-than-necessary denials;apparently the president's finger-wagging days are over. (Of course, no one islikely to believe Clinton no matter what he says.) But Chatterbox remainspessimistic that he will ever be able to draw a truly responsibleconclusion about whether Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broaddrick. Moreover, sinceChatterbox has already concluded that Clinton, being morally unfit toremain in office, should resign, he doesn't really know how his political worldview would change--beyond, of course, concluding that Clinton was an evenbigger creep than he thought--in the unlikely event Chatterbox couldverify Broaddrick's story. (It's too late for Broaddrick herself to take anylegal action.)            Meanwhile, Chatterbox is wondering when the news staff of the Wall StreetJournal will write about the Broaddrick controversy. Although D.C. bureauchief Alan Murray was right not to break Juanita's story, now that it's "outthere," the news staff is in an awkward position. Clearly, the best way for theJournal 's news staff to write about Broaddrick would be the way theNew York Times and the Washington Post have--partly siftingevidence concerning a widely publicized accusation, and partly examining theethics and motives of the Journal 's editorial page for printing it inthe first place. But while the Journal 's news staff remains free toreport on Broaddrick, it is presumably not free to really report on(i.e., question the ethics and motives of) the Journal 's editorialpage.            -- Timothy Noah
