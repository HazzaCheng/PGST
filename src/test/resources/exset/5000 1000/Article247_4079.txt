                                 Malpractice Makes Perfect                           USAToday , the Washington Post , and New York Times all lead with aprestigious independent medical organization's call for a new federal agencydedicated to minimizing medical mistakes, which, says the organization, are nowkilling between 44,000 and 98,000 people a year. The Los AngelesTimes reefers this to a Page 3 story, leading instead with the namingin Northern Ireland Monday of a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing Cabinet,which could mean the true end of "The Troubles" in that country.            The papers explain the basic point of the medical error recommendations:most slip-ups occur not from individual ineptness but from structural flaws inthe ways hospitals and caregivers function. An example both the NYT andthe WP cite is prescribing the wrong drug because its name is verysimilar to the right one. Systematically noting and disseminating such possibleconfusions to physicians would reduce risk. All three leads make the point thatmedicine could benefit from following the tracking and notification proceduresof other risky fields like aviation and nuclear power. The NYT notesthat establishing such a system is thought to cost only slightly more than 1percent of the $8.8 billion in health-care costs attributable to preventablemedical injuries.            The biggest unclarity in the medical error coverage has to do with who wouldget to see the results of the proposed systematic error tracking. Just doctors,or potential patients too? USAT refers to reporting "without fear ofpunishment," which suggests a pretty tight lid. Both the NYT andWP suggest that the system envisioned would allow serious medical errorsto be made known to the public but keep less serious ones confidential. Butthere's no discussion of whether this makes sense from the patient's point ofview. A related point: There's already a data bank for sharing informationabout incompetent doctors. Surely it would be relevant to know if it functionssimilarly to what's being proposed now and to know if it has indeed helped makemedicine safer.            The other significant wiggle room in the stories relates to the dimension ofthe medical error problem. USAT says it's the eighth-largest killer inthe U.S. The WP suggests it's the fifth. How do the two papers getdifferent results off the very same press release? Well, USAT goes withthe low end estimate of error-based fatalities and the Post goes withthe high end.            The NYT and LAT go high on their fronts with reports thatMexican and U.S. authorities have begun excavating sites in Mexico very nearthe Texas border believed to be a dumping ground for scores of Mexicans andAmericans killed by drug traffickers within the past few years. The LATsays officials are expecting to find between 100 and 300 corpses. Both paperssay that members of Mexican law enforcement are suspects in some of thesemurders. USAT blurbs the story inside.            The USAT off-lead and the top story in the Wall Street Journal business news index is that later thisweek, on the heels of a spate of problems with Boeing airliners, the FAA willstart a thorough safety inspection of the company's manufacturing plants,focusing on quality control procedures. The Journal says the field auditcomes after months of increasing tension between the agency and company.            The LAT fronts, and the WP and NYT stuff, thedeveloping saga of that 5-year-old Cuban refugee boy plucked from the oceannear Miami on Thanksgiving morning. The boy, who saw his mother drown and thenspent 24 hours adrift in an inner tube, is the object of an international tugof war. He is staying with relatives in Florida and has become, says theLAT , a poster child for anti-Castro exiles there, but his father, backin Cuba, wants him returned. The boy is said to want to remain in the U.S. Thematter will probably end up in federal court.            The WSJ reports that the World Wrestling Federation, faced withadvertiser pullouts, may be toning down its material. It quotes WWF minor domoVince McMahon as saying viewers will soon see less aggression, less colorfullanguage, and less sexuality. The biggest advertiser to pull out over contentis Coke, which has a wait-and-see attitude about coming back. Another refugeefrom the sex and violence: the U.S. Army.
