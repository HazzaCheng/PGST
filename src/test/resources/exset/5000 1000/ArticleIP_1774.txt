The pocket cartoon on thefront page of London's Daily Telegraph Thursday showed a little boy on his father's kneelearning about Monicagate. "And if the daddy bee is caught with a lady bee whoisn't the mummy bee, then the daddy bee might have to resign as President ofthe United States," said Dad. The resignation or impeachment of the presidentnow seems taken for granted in much of the European press.            The scandal story got moreattention in Europe than in other parts of the world, and much more in Britainthan in other parts of Europe. Rupert Murdoch's British tabloid, the Sun(circulation 4 million), carried a massive front-page headline, "Clinton: TheLast Hours," and an editorial saying about the White House "soap opera," "Theworld knows how the plot will end, and there are few episodes left." But theSun added that "for all the personal shame of Clinton, America can holdits head high. The land of the free has upheld the finest democratictraditions."            Thepolitical cartoonist of the Times of London showed the American eagle stealing the arrows offthe presidential seal and defecating on Clinton's head as it flew away. TheFinancial Times ran aneditorial titled "The Indignity of It All," blaming the president fully for hismisfortunes. "His words are weasel ones, his actions based forever on politicalexpediency," it said. "He still appears to think that the affair is aright-wing conspiracy, and he cannot see what he did wrong."            The conservative Daily Telegraph ran a two pagescandal chronology compiled by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, who, as its Washingtoncorrespondent, began investigating Clinton in 1993 and, according to the paper,was "vilified by the White House aides" as a result. "Once the members of thejudiciary committee have examined the text [of the Starr report], in all itsshocking and prurient detail," Evans-Pritchard wrote, "they will acknowledgethat the President is a borderline sociopath who must be removed at once." Inan editorial, the Telegraph described the president assitting "in a political wheelchair." "He may beat his breast. He may blackenhis opponents. His charm and theatrical abilities may see him through for a bitlonger, but it is, sadly, to no purpose. He cannot save himself; he can onlydegrade his office further."            Le Monde of Paris restricted itseditorializing Thursday to publishing on its front page, under the rubric"Point of View," the full text of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's speech to the SenateSept. 3. Clinton didn't make the front page of Le Figaro, the conservativeParis daily, but led the foreign news section under the headline "ClintonParalyzed and Demoralized." The paper also ran a short and unoriginal commenton the dilemmas facing Al Gore as he comes daily closer to fulfilling hispresidential ambitions.            In Italy,the story of the delivery of the Starr report was touched upon only briefly onthe front pages but was covered extensively on the foreign pages. La Stampa of Turin ran a commentby Gabriele Romagnoli, who asked why nobody has asked Clinton the mostimportant question: "Mr. President, who the devil ordered the bombing of Sudanand why?"            In Asia, which is preoccupied with its ownproblems, and in Australia, which has its mind on elections, the fate of theU.S. presidency did not dominate the news, though the Sydney Morning Herald ran areport Friday, headlined "Lameduck looks like a dying duck," from its Washington correspondent, JenniferHewett. "Mr. Clinton is in for the fight of his life just to remain in amuch-diminished Oval Office," she wrote. In Israel, Ha'aretz led its frontpage Thursday not with Clinton's troubles but with the news that U.S.special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, currently in Jerusalem, is hopingto draft a new Israeli pullback package before the end of this week.            Earlierthis week, the Pakistani paper Dawn ran an editorial about reports that Pakistani poppy growersare planning to recultivate opium on a bigger scale because they haven'treceived promised compensation for switching to other crops. "The authoritiesmust take the challenge of crop substitution seriously," it said.
