                                 Someday (Maybe), You'll Buy Cars on the Web                        The promise of the Internet, from a business perspective, is the promise ofa frictionless economy, in which buyers and sellers are able to meet withoutmediation. And since perhaps the most disliked mediators out there are cardealers, they would seem to be natural and inevitable casualties of consumers'migration to the Internet. Very few people like bargaining with car dealers.Auto companies don't like their now-almost-required reliance on rebates to movecars. And the whole phenomenon of the huge dealership, with acres of cars, eachdepreciating by the minute, seems like an archaic way of handling distribution(and, since someone has to make all those cars, production).            At the same time, the smartest auto manufacturers, like Ford and Toyota, arealready working hard at integrating the Internet into their operations anddeveloping build-to-order systems. Eventually, you should be able tocommunicate directly with Ford, pick out the car you want with the options youwant, and have it delivered to your door, just like a Dell PC. Ford won't haveto make cars it's not going to be able to sell, and you won't have to hagglewith some dealer. (This was what I was imagining at the end of the lastMoneybox, when I wrote about GM truly becoming an Internet company.)            The only problem with this picture of the future is that it's currentlyagainst the law. Just about every state in the United States, in fact, hasstrong franchise laws that limit the size and scope of dealerships, effectivelyregulate the allocation of vehicles to dealers, bar large-volume discounts, andprevent dealers from selling across state lines. Needless to say, actuallybuying a car on the Internet is therefore impossible, which is why all thecar-buying services on the Net are actually local filtering devices, allowingyou to comparison-shop. That's an obvious advance over the old days, but it'sstill a long way from a real Internet market.            In essence, local car dealers have been able to create and maintaingeographic oligopolies through the use of franchise laws. That's one reason whythe category-killer approach to car-selling, exemplified by AutoNation (whichjust announced it was closing its used-car superstores), has floundered sobadly. If Wal-Mart weren't able to offer lower prices in its stores because itwas barred from getting volume discounts from its suppliers, it would hardly bea powerhouse retailer. Economics of scale come into play only if things getcheaper the bigger you get. Otherwise you've just got more overhead.            But while the demise of the car superstore should probably be lamented, thereally nefarious impact of the state franchise laws is unquestionably on thenot-yet-existing Net market. Those laws are in part a product of older concernsabout vertical integration, so that they served the function of keeping theauto-makers from selling direct to consumers. And they also allow states tokeep a tight grip on the tax revenue from auto sales. But they are almosttextbook examples of bad regulation, which accomplish nothing but putting lotsof money in dealers' pockets.            Even if Congress, say, were to pass a law permitting the direct sale ofcars, that wouldn't mean that auto-makers would embrace direct sellingimmediately. An article in the new Fast Company , for instance, suggeststhat Toyota's management was hesitant to Web-ify the company precisely becauseit was afraid that would lead to direct sales, which would alienate dealers(and break the law). And it's plausible that a car is such a big purchase thatmany people are going to be uncomfortable buying one online, sight unseen. Butas an alternative, one can easily imagine something like what Gateway does nowwith its Country Stores, where you can test-drive a PC and then order itimmediately online. There will, of course, be auto manufacturers that even adecade from now are still working through the traditional dealer system. But ifyou look at the PC industry, and the difference between the success ofdirect-selling Dell and Gateway and the struggles of dealer-centric Compaq andIBM, the idea that those auto manufacturers who stay tied to dealers willflourish seems dubious indeed.            Of course, first all those laws have to be changed.
