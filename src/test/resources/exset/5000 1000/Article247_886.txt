                                 Twentieth-Century Foxes            BRENTWOOD--Twenty-one million dollars for Leonardo DiCaprio to star inAmerican Psycho , whose main virtue is it allows him to apply jumpercables to women's body parts? Can you say, "I hate my young femaleaudience?"            But it's nice he's getting the big payday, because after last week, you'dthink this town had in it for Italians. First, of course, came Frank Sinatra,his death the beau ideal of an on-time departure, given his image's pendulumswing over the last three decades from ultracool to camp to ultracool oncemore. Sinatra--the only celebrity who ever sued a journalist for writing a bookthat, in his view, made his life seem too boring--was pronounced dead in thesame Cedars-Sinai emergency room where one week earlier a 50-year-old mancollapsed and died of a Viagra overdose, his heart seizing up after taking justfour of the tablets. (Coincidence? Uh, probably.)            Then came the news that Mike Piazza, the Los Angeles' Dodgers star catcher,had been shipped off to the Florida Marlins--the first major move for theDodgers since the baseball team was purchased by Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Piazzawas the Dodgers' best player on the field, its most popular with the fans, andits most expensive to keep. He and his rocket scientist of an agent hadrecently turned down a six-year offer from the Dodgers worth more than $80million. Piazza publicly dissed the Dodgers' proposal, which made the Marlinsdeal look like management's up-your-nose-with-a-rubber-hose payback, especiallygiven Piazza's long-running romance with the SoCal lifestyle.            Baseball experts, such as the godlike Peter Gammons, have noted that thetrade leaves the Dodgers with an improved team ... but what's interesting aboutthe deal is the way it flies in the face of traditional L.A. sports-teamwisdom, which holds that any team in this showbiz-savvy market needsstars--marquee players--to attract attention. Exhibit A: Jerry West's Lakerteams, now seeking a basketball title with movie and rap star Shaquille O'Nealalongside fresh-faced phenom Kobe Bryant. Exhibit B: the faceless and fan-lessL.A. Clippers.            Piazza was that kind of A-list star, but Fox didn't care--a decision inkeeping with the studio's Hollywood strategy. Fox has taken a lot of heat forbeing the kind of company which didn't seem to care about shmoozing talent.When they wouldn't pony up huge bucks for TV and film producer James L. Brooksafter he brought them The Simpsons , Big , and The War of theRoses , he took still more money at Sony. Years later, Fox bid goodbye tothe producing/directing team of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, who've justmade Godzilla for Sony. Last summer, Fox made Speed 2 withoutKeanu Reeves, and lost a bundle. Earlier this year, they took plenty of heatfor not paying Jim Cameron despite reaping zillions from Titanic.                        The results? Jim Brooks is still a brilliant moviemaker, but while he gaveSony Jerry Maguire and As Good as It Gets, he also saddled thatstudio with the $40 million non-starter I'll Do Anything.               Godzilla will open, but its legs are suspect. Jim Cameron's pendingdivorce may go further toward explaining why he didn't arrange to see a lot ofmoney from his blockbuster right away than Fox's greed does.            Meanwhile, Fox is doing fine. It has the X-Files movie on the way, a$60 million picture with a cult following so large, the film'll get to $100million without breathing hard--even though it was months after shooting hadended before the studio's marketing head was allowed to read past page 60 inthe script. Something About Mary, a Peter Farrelly comedy, has niftyword-of-mouth. And Fox has the right to distribute George Lucas's inevitablylucrative Star Wars prequels.            And while Hollywood struggles to find meaning in Titanic andLeo-mania, Fox's newly-minted, longterm deal with Aussie auteur BazLuhrmann--who directed DiCaprio in Romeo and Juliet --shows that they doget it, after all. Titanic was an impossibly bold undertaking, cost $200million, and made five times its cost worldwide. Romeo and Juliet was aslickly-shot retelling of an timeless story, cost $19 million and made morethan five times its cost worldwide. Which success would appear less taxing to astudio's resources and more easy to repeat? Fox's star-averse approach hasn'talways made them popular--just ask all the kids still wearing Mike Piazza'snumber--but it might make them Most Likely to Succeed.            -- Chris Connelly
