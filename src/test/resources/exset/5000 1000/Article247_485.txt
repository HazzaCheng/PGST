                                 Verdicting It Up            The Terry Nichols verdict leads all around. USA Todaycalls the conviction on conspiracy and manslaughter counts but acquittal on1st-degree murder charges "a surprising compromise." The New York Timescalls the result "a nuanced verdict." The Los AngelesTimes and the Wall Street Journal emphasize that the decisionconsiderably lessens the likelihood that Nichols will be condemned todeath.                           USAT says that inside the courtroom, relatives of victims "appearedcrestfallen" at the news. The NYT finds them "stunned." The dailies arerelentless in their programmatic use of "balancing" language to describe familyreactions--"many" are angry, "some" are shocked, etc.--despite producing nofamily members saying the verdicts are just. Instead, when it comes toparticulars, we have everybody quoting the comment of a woman whose SecretService agent husband was killed in the Oklahoma blast: "It was a slap in theface."            The reactions noted are often incisive as well as anguished. A woman wholost two small grandsons tells the NYT , "Terry Nichols and TimothyMcVeigh conspired for seven months to blow up that building. That's notinvoluntary manslaughter. That's first-degree murder." Similarly, a woman wholost a daughter is quoted in USAT and the Washington Post saying, "He conspired to build the bomb;what the hell did they think he was going to do with it!" In the WP andNYT and USAT stories, the juxtaposition of these expressions ofdissatisfaction with President Clinton's remark that the verdicts "should offera measure of comfort" makes Clinton look particularly tin-eared.            When the papers strive to make sense of the verdict, they tend to look thatway too. The Times says that the manslaughter verdicts mean that thejury held that the deaths were foreseeable results of a lawful act. But whatwas that lawful act? The NYT doesn't say. (Surely not helping to build abomb.) Similarly, the Times editorial on the Nichols decision ably frames thepuzzle: "At first blush it seems contradictory to find that Mr. Nichols wasguilty of conspiring in the bombing, a crime that seems to have requiredpremeditation, but then not to find him guilty of first-degree, orpremeditated, murder. Involuntary manslaughter usually involves recklessnessbut not premeditation." But then the paper trots out a dubious answer: "Still,that may be a reasonable decision in that Mr. Nichols may not have planned thatthe bomb be set off with the purpose of killing these agents." But whatalternative purpose did he have? Not one word in all the coverage aboutthat.            The WSJ comes closest here, venturing that the jury must haveaccepted Nichols's defense that he had abandoned the plot before the explosion.But neither the Journal nor the other papers pass along any informationthat makes such a possibility plausible.            The Post makes a rookie mistake in referring to the jury's "innocent"verdicts. It's "Not Guilty," not "Innocent."            The NYT front carries word of a clearer resolution to anotherterrorism case: the conviction in France of Carlos "The Jackal"--once theworld's most feared terrorist--of three murders. The Post runs this onp.8.            The WSJ reports that Newt Gingrich, in an obvious bid to plug holesin the C-SPAN spring schedule (that damned yellow bus has to go in the shop fora tune-up sometime), is poised to launch investigations into White House andDNC activities that could involve fully half of the House's committees.            The WP states that the University of Iowa College of Medicine reportsthat people who are blind, deaf or have other disabilities are 36 percent morelikely to be injured on the job. The paper also reports that today's issue ofJAMA contains the news that although more than 90 percent of infants don't getanesthesia when they are circumcised, they should get it because "study ofinfant heart rates and crying patterns during circumcision clearly showed therewas pain." So, to sum up today's scientific breakthroughs: a) If you're blindavoid working in sawmills and b) Getting your brand-new knicky-knacks carved onHURTS LIKE HELL!
