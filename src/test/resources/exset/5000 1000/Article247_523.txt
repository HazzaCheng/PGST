                                 B-2 Or Not B-2?            Everybody leads with that case-against-Iraq speech President Clinton gave atthe Pentagon yesterday. Speaking to an auditorium full of military and civilianDefense employees, and from a platform he shared with his Secretary of Defenseand his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Clinton justified possible airstrikeswith an implicit reference to the failures of appeasement in the period justbefore World War II. "Force can never be the first answer," said Clinton. "Butsometimes, it's the only answer."            In its piece on the speech, USA Today mentions that the Secretary-General of theU.N., Kofi Annan, is going to Baghdad to try for a peaceful resolution. TheWashington Post makes it clear that if Annan'smission fails to produce Iraqi compliance, an air bombardment is a "virtualcertainty." The administration's old line was, says the paper, "weeks notmonths," but its new one is "days not weeks."            Both the WP and the New York Timesnote that Clinton has defined down his military objective--now we are after,not totally ridding Iraq of mass destruction weapons, but seriously diminishingtheir threat. However, Clinton did not, notes the Times , explain at whatpoint he would consider the Iraqi threat seriously diminished.            The Times ' James Bennet obviously got to somebody present at themilitary briefing Clinton attended just before speaking. His report revealsthat the briefing ran 45 minutes and centered on the details of a militarystrike. Clinton mostly listened and made no new decisions. But he did ask aboutthe potential casualties in a strike, both among Iraqi civilians and Americanpilots. He also asked about Iraq's ability to use chemical and biologicalweapons in a confrontation.            Both the WP and the NYT mention President Clinton's dismissalof Saddam's desire to exempt certain "presidential" sites from weaponsinspection. One such site, Clinton explained, is 40,000 acres, whereas theWhite House grounds take up but 18. The Times includes this quote of the president's: "We're not talking about a few roomshere with delicate personal matters involved." In the age of Lewinsky, youdon't have to be Freud to find that an interesting choice of words for whatgoes on in the White House.            The LosAngeles Times wisely puts at the top of its lead the simplest, mostforceful argument Clinton made, one that both USAT and WP omittedand the NYT postponed until the last paragraphs of its story: His"guarantee" that if Hussein isn't stopped now, he will someday use hisbiochemical weapons.            The USAT , WP , and LAT fronts all report PresidentClinton's lawyers asked the judge in the Paula Jones case to dismiss her suitfor lack of substance. The WP runs the text of Clinton's legal motion in the matter, which includes anargument that strikes the lay person as bizarrely permissive: Even on theassumption that then-Gov. Clinton undertook the actions towards Paula Jones inthe Excelsior Hotel room that Jones alleges, that would not constitute "hostileenvironment sexual harassment" because Jones went to the room voluntarily, theepisode only lasted at most 20 minutes, there was no violence or explicitthreats and she was able to leave when she decided to.            The NYT front marshals the factors behind that ski lift disaster inItaly two weeks ago: on his first flight in the area, the Marine Corps pilotdid not have maps showing the ski lift, was violating orders to fly 1,000 abovethe ground and was off-course. All this beneath a headline that is simplyextraordinary in this age of lawyers restraining editors restraining reporters:"HOW WAYWARD US PILOT KILLED 20 ON SKI LIFT."            "I know it's not the most traditional way to balance the budget, but it justmight work." According to the Wall Street Journal "Tax Report," some 3,000 taxpayersrecently received notices from the IRS informing them that they each owed theagency $300,000,000.            At the Pentagon, real-world combat requirements come first--except when theydon't. A WP front-page piece reveals that even though the B2 stealth bomber is the most expensive aircraft ever built($2 billion a copy), and could drop large numbers of "bunker buster" bombs onIraq without ever setting foot on skittish Arab runways, it's not likely to seeaction over Iraq. The Pentagon corridor explanation teased out by the WPis that if it were to fail it would be a colossal embarrassment for the AirForce, while if it were to succeed it might siphon money away from newer hotAir Force aircraft programs.
