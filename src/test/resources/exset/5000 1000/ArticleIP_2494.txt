Tothe surprise of the buyers, present at the small gathering was no other thanMonica herself. She was, they reported, not only luscious but charming andwitty. Soon we can expect a raft of such reports in which Monica will slowly berevealed as a renaissance woman, whose deep knowledge of American poetry ismatched only by her understanding of the historical tensions underlying thecurrent insurrections in Kosovo (she worries especially about the Bulgarianconnection tho doubts that Kosovo's natives are in fact the heirs ofAlexander).

I ran into her last night at the Mayflower Hotel where she washaving cocktails with several middle-aged men in double breasted suits. She isas perky and precocious as Bill Safire and Cokie Roberts say. When I spoke withher, she apologized for her slightly glazed eyes, having spent the lastforty-eight hours teaching herself ancient Greek. With all this time on herhands, she has decided to read Homer in the original. She also said she was atwork on a translation of Vico. We engaged in a perfectly delightfulconversation about the Pentagon's two-war strategy. The descriptions of her inthe press as "competent" hardly do her justice.

I understand she's been invitedby Sally Quinn to speak at that school for challenged kids in Georgetown.

She was applying for adevelopment position with the Windows 99 team. Her resume said she couldprogram c, c++, Java, DHTML, VSS, BSS, and STD. She claims STD was one of theeasier ones to acquire!

She gave me a 15-minutedisquisition on the NBA's illegal defense rule: I've never heard it explainedso carefully. Turns out she's a big basketball fan too--she played a little forLewis & Clark (shooting guard, natch), and was even drafted by the WNBA. (Iguess that explains where she got those kneepads.)

You're all being sexist. If a man haddone what she did, no one would ... wait a minute, that's not right. Well,never mind, just get back to work.
