                                 Fed Up            The New York Times ,the LosAngeles Times , and the Washington Post lead with the Federal Reserve'ssecond interest-rate hike of the summer. USAToday mentions the Fed's news on the front page, but leads instead witha possible link between the Kremlin and the Bank of New York launderingscandal.            All the papers give the same lowdown on the Fed's decision. The federalfunds rate (that is, the one banks charge each another for overnight borrowing)was lifted from 5 percent to 5.25 percent, reversing last year's cuts. TheFed's announcement was characteristically opaque. The stories follow the Fed'slead, hedging their bets as to whether this will be the last hike of theyear.            The WP and the Wall Street Journal run helpful explanations of thehike's repercussions. According to the WP , banks already announcedincreases in their prime lending rates to 8.25 percent from 8 percent. Sincemany credit-card balances, home-equity loans, small business bank loans, andsome personal loans are tied directly to the prime rate, millions of consumerswill see their monthy payments swell soon. A piece inside the Journalwarns the higher cost of borrowing may keep funds away from Latin Americancountries that need the cash badly.            Meanwhile, a WP editorial argues that Alan Greenspan has become soeffective that he's ineffective. If Greenspan raises rates, investors areassured by what they interpret as a wise, pre-emptive strike against inflation.If he doesn't, they are emboldened by what can only be a sure sign of economichealth. So even though the rate hike might stave off consumer inflation,Greenspan is inevitably contributing to stock price inflation.            Last week the Times reported that hundreds of millions of dollars in IMFloans to Russia may have been illegally diverted through the Bank of New Yorkvia the Russian mafia. Today USAT adds that Konstantin Kagalovsky,Russia's representative to the IMF and a close crony of Victor Chernomyrdin, isnow under scrutiny. He is married to a Bank of New York executive who is alsobeing investigated. The scoop certainly sounds like a potentially juicy one.But it lists no allegations against the Kagalovskys, and doesn't surmise abouthow they might have fit into the IMF-Mafia-Bank triangle.            The NYT and the WP report that China will prosecute the mostsenior members of Falun Gong--and only the most senior ones. A government orderexcused most of the sect's adherents as victims who didn't know they werejoining a subversive political organization. The group's leaders, on the otherhand, will almost certainly be sent to prison for life--just in time, says theTimes , for the Chinese Communist Party's 50th birthday bash.            According to a NYT front-pager, the San Francisco Department ofHealth has traced an outbreak of syphilis to an America Online chat room. Atleast six men have contracted syphilis from sexual partners they met at SanFrancisco Men 4 Men, a chat room hosted by AOL. Citing privacy concerns,America Online would not divulge the real names of the chat room users to thehealth authorities. Instead, the company contacted Planet Out, a gay onlineservice based in the city, which pelted the denizens of local gay chat roomswith e-mailed and instant-messengered warnings.            The WP and the NYT front the news that Samuel Sheinbein, theteen-ager who set off an extradition battle when he fled to Israel afterallegedly committing murder in Maryland, has accepted a plea bargain in Israel.The Israeli Supreme Court had refused extradition on the controversial groundsthat Sheinbein is Israeli (his father was born in 1944 in Palestine. Israel wasfounded in 1948). He will serve 24 years--a heavy sentence in the Israelisystem, but a light one by American standards. Prosecutors from both countriesdecried the way he manipulated the discrepancies between the two legalsystems.            A NYT front-pager provides welcome perspective on the Kansas SchoolBoard's recent decision to excise evolution from its official curriculum. Mostscience teachers will continue to teach evolution. Moreover, "there are 304locally elected school boards who have the option to tell the state board to gojump in the lake," said an aide to moderate Republican Gov. Bill Graves. "TheGovernor is confident the overwhelming number will."
