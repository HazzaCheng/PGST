Participants are invited todescribe his final strip. (Question courtesy of JonDelfin.)                                                         "BothSchroeder and Peppermint Patty come out of the closet as Schulz admits his'don't ask, don't tell' policy was a failure."-- Ken Novak ( ChrisKelly had a similar answer.)

Snoopy muses on whatlife will be like without the boy with the crooked smile. Back in the surgicalunit, the doctors prepare to give Charlie Brown his first round ofchemotherapy. Lucy comes running in, and kicks the needle out of the doctors'hands."-- Larry Amoros                        "Charlie Brown wakes up in bed with Suzanne Pleshette and discovers it's allbeen a horrible dream.

Randy's Wrap-Up                        I liked Peanuts .(It is difficult to be funny in praise of anything, so if you want your littlelaughs, leave off here and go peruse those newly released medical records withtheir vivid--a little too vivid--description of the polyps Al Gore doesn't havein his colon. I'll meet you there later. I'll bring the sandwiches.) For 50years, with impressive economy of line and language, Schulz avoided thedimwitted rhythm of setup/lackluster punch line that defined comic strips andwould soon dominate TV sitcoms. Unlike most strips, his was about adults,albeit adults depicted as children. And still more unusual, he was notconcerned with the follies and foibles of everyday life, that least interestingcomic subject, but something deeper, darker, and less ephemeral. Along withMad magazine, he provided comedy to my suburban boyhood--Schulz thephilosophical and Mad the topical--at just the right intellectual levelfor a suburban boy. And if he sometimes wandered into whimsy--that alluringcomic swamp--and even farther, into mawkish sentimentality with "Happiness Is aWarm Puppy," he more often executed that most difficult comic turn, beingsimultaneously funny and sweet. Few can. Thurber, Woody Allen, and MarkO'Donnell come to mind. But not many more. I'll miss the strip.                           Happiness Is aWarm Answer                        We can, of course, only speculate. Schulz worksabout six weeks ahead; the final daily installment will run Jan. 3; the lastnew Sunday strip will be published Feb. 13.            The first Peanutsappeared Oct., 2, 1950. It now runs in 2,600 newspapers, reaching about 355million readers daily in 75 countries.
