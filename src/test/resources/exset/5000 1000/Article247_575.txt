                                 Journalism's Pellet Surprise                           USAToday and the Los Angeles Times lead with the latest U.S. economic news:surging growth but the slowest rate of inflation increase in 35 years. The topnational story at the Washington Post is President Clinton's hard-nosedself-defense at his first press conference in months. The New York Timesmetro edition goes with the Senate's overwhelming approval of NATO expansion(the earlier, national edition goes with the tax evasion indictment ofalready-once-convicted Felon of Bill, Webster Hubbell).            The WP coverage of the presidential pressconference--accompanied by a picture of a pugnacious double-fistedClinton--reports that he dismissed allegations about his character as the workof organized foes "unable to counter his ideas or record," but acknowledgedthat seven years of their attacks have diminished his personal standing withthe American people. This used to distress him greatly, said Clinton, but notanymore. The paper observes that nearly half of the questions posed by thepress concerned his still-unexplained relationship with Monica Lewinsky, butthat despite his January promise to illuminate it, Clinton didn't answerthem.            The NYT wash-up of the NATO vote explains that all 16current members of the alliance must approve the change in order for it to takeeffect. ( USAT 's front page NATO story says that such total approval isexpected by the alliance's 50th anniversary summit in Washington next year.)The Times piece also includes a workmanlike exposition of the politicsof the vote, including the observation that expansion was supported by the U.S.defense industry, which stands to "reap huge profits" from increased weaponssales to new NATO members.            The WP front features new federal statistics about teen birth rates (the storyruns inside at the NYT ) indicating that for the first time they are downamong every racial and ethnic group. Oddly, neither story includes any data onteen out-of-wedlock birth rates. Highlights: The African-American teenbirthrate is down 21 percent since 1990--its lowest level ever. Hispanic teens,while still the most prolific, have experienced a rate drop for the first time.Non-Hispanic white teens are still almost three times less likely to becomemothers than either Hispanics or blacks.            Earlier this week, the WP took a front-page look at the Pentagon'stroubled and expensive history with anti-missile defense systems. Today, a newdevelopment in the arena gets covered by the Post , but is relegated tothe business section. Curious, since yesterday's award to Boeing of a contractto develop a missile shield could be worth up to $5.1 billion. The LATwhispers the story the same way. Which, is, of course, the way the defensecontractors like it.            The Wall Street Journal front features an excellent storyuncovering a little-known problem: racial discrimination in farm loans. The paper describesthe attempts by some struggling black farmers to get restitution from the USDA.Thus far, despite a four-hour meeting with President Clinton and an admissionby USDA secretary Dan Glickman that his department had swept the problem underthe rug, as well as numerous specific findings of illegal denials of loans, thefarmers are still waiting to be made whole. Scandalous.            The LAT front covers a sensational, disturbing story likely to be much discussed in thedays ahead. Yesterday, during L.A.'s rush hour, near one of the city's busiestintersections, a distraught man killed himself with a shotgun blast to thehead--while many Angelenos watched on one or another of the local TV stations'live broadcasts. Afterwards, most of the stations expressed regret for thecoverage and some offered counseling to viewers.            The episode could have a number of important consequences: Before taking hislife, the man had unfurled a banner reading: "HMOs are in it for the money!!Live Free. Love Safe or Die." So perhaps the suicide will further crystallizethe discussion of the impersonality of managed care. (Why, by the way, didn'tthe LAT mention the sexual disease-- probably AIDS--angle?) And perhapsit will break the back of the L.A. trend of automatically going with(invariably highly rated) live broadcasts of potentially violent freewayincidents.            The Hubbell indictment gets lots of ink and produces the day's strangestquote. "The office of independent counsel could indict my dog. They can indictmy cat. But I'm not going to lie about the president. I'm not going to lieabout the first lady or anyone else." Hubbell's wife, who was indicted alongwith him, must have been thrilled with this disclosure of the true familypecking order.
