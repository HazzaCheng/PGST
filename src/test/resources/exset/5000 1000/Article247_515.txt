                                 Tripped Up            The New York Timesleads with a bit of a bombshell about the grand jury testimony of PresidentClinton's personal secretary. The Washington Post leads with the news that Linda Tripp gavean affidavit about Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Wiley to Paula Jones' lawyers.The top national story at the Los Angeles Times is the emerging pressure on theClinton administration to not just strike against Saddam Hussein, but removehim. USAToday goes with the severe storms that are forecasted to punish bothcoasts starting today.            According to the NYT lead, Ken Starr's quest to find out who the Presidentknew and when did he know her may have gotten a big boost from the grand juryappearance of Betty Currie, who testified that Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinskywere sometimes alone together in the White House. Additionally, says the paper,the day after giving his Jones case deposition, Clinton told Currie that he hadnever been alone with Monica Lewinsky and that he had resisted her sexualadvances.            Also, the Times reports, Currie turned over to investigators severalgifts that Clinton had given to Lewinsky--a dress, a brooch, and a hatpin.According to Lewinsky's account to Starr, after Jones' lawyers issued asubpoena demanding Lewinsky surrender any gifts the President gave her, shediscussed this with Clinton and he told her if she didn't have the gifts, shewouldn't have to turn them over. And soon after that conversation, says theTimes , Currie collected the items from Lewinsky. The paper also quotes aperson who has read Clinton's deposition as saying that when asked by Jones'lawyers if he had given Lewinsky any gifts, the president replied that perhaps,but only ordinary White House souvenirs.            The Post lead nails down the scandal's earliest knowndetails. In her January 21, 1998 affidavit for Jones (still under seal butsomehow obtained by the WP ), Tripp says Lewinsky told her of an affairwith Clinton commencing on November 15, 1995, and that Lewinsky had played atleast three tapes for Tripp containing Clinton's voice and showed her giftsfrom Clinton. Tripp also says that Lewinsky had told her she planned to lieunder oath if questioned about the relationship by Jones' attorneys.            Inside, the Post runs Tripp's sworn statement in its entirety. In it, Trippdescribes herself as having once served in the Clinton White House as an"apolitical careerist."            The Wall Street Journal reports that during his Middle Eastshuttle, Secretary of Defense Cohen may ask some smaller Gulf states to take upto 60 U.S. fighter-bombers now based in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon, says theJournal , feels it can live with the Saudi policy of not allowing U.S.bombers to base there, but still allowing other U.S. combat support aircraft todo so.            The WP front and the NYT inside run stories about the clashbetween U.S. and Italian officials over what happened when that Americanmilitary jet sliced a ski-lift suspension wire killing 20 people. An Americangeneral says the plane was following a standard training route, and thus farthe crew have refused to speak with Italian investigators. The Italians arecharging that the aircraft was too low and was hot-dogging. They are evenalleging that the plane was equipped with a flight data recorder but that theAmericans are withholding it. "Killer pilots" is a phrase that has appeared inthe Italian press.                           USAT reports that the makers of the best-selling drug in the U.S,Astra, has agreed to pay a record nearly $10 million to female employees whoclaimed that they were pressured for sex by company officials and urged to wearbikinis at a beach function.            A NYT top front piece discusses how newly released documents from thetobacco industry giants make it clearer than ever just how hard the companiestried to market cigarettes--especially mentholated ones--to blacks. A 1973Brown and Williamson document quoted speaks of the possibility that "Kool willcover the top 25 markets in terms of absolute Negroes." The revelations haveled to calls from minority lawmakers and health authorities that some proceedsfrom any global tobacco settlement be earmarked for minorities.            What with all the headlines about Democratic Party fundraising, you mightthink the Dems take in more dough than the Republicans. You might be wrong--theWP runs a Reuters piece inside stating that in 1997, the GOP raised $37million more--$114 million to $77 million.            Yesterday's WP ran a story on the current political turmoil inZimbabwe under the headline "Winter of Discontent." But that's wrong. Afterall, with a latitude of 19 degrees below the equator, Zimbabwe's now in themiddle of summer .
