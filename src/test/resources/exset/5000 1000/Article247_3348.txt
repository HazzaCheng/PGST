                                 Is the New Economy Over?                        For the really bad news, we'll have to wait until Friday morning, when theJuly jobs report is released. (Actually, most of you reading this will probablyalready have heard the bad news.) But Thursday's news on the inflation frontwas already dismaying. The Department of Labor reported that nonfarm businessproductivity rose just 1.3 percent in the second quarter, after a 3.6 percentleap in the first. Along with that came news that unit labor costs leapt 3.8percent in the second quarter, after a minuscule 0.8 percent increase in thefirst.            A rise in labor costs is, of course, a good thing for American workers, mostof whom are still seeing only slight increases in their real income. But a risein labor costs without a concomitant rise in labor productivity is generallytaken as a sign that inflationary pressures are in the offing. (If they're not,then corporate profits are going to take a serious hit.) Today's numbers werenot disastrous. But assuming that the jobs report is as good (or, rather, bad)as is expected, meaning that hundreds of thousands of new jobs were created inJuly, a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike now seems like a foregoneconclusion.            Productivity is the key economic statistic, because only increases inproductivity can increase the ability of the economy to grow without theartificial boost of inflation. The more output we get per worker-hour, the moreincome per hour each worker can earn. If productivity were to remain stagnant,then the economy could grow only as fast as the size of the work force grew.But when, as in the last three years, productivity increases at a 3 percentannual rate, the limits of the economy are extended.            Output per worker hour may seem slightly esoteric, but in fact it's theideal measure of productivity because it makes explicit the heart of alleconomic growth: the conversion of time, through labor, into value. The onlyway an economy can become something more than a bunch of people taking in eachother's washing, that is, the only way an economy can actually improve livingstandards and increase the collective wealth, is when one of two thingshappens: Either people work more hours, changing empty time into a product orservice, or people create more value with those same hours. In a boomingeconomy like this one, people do both.            The slowdown in productivity, then, doesn't bode well for those who assumedthat the economy could keep growing at 4 percent indefinitely without sparkinginflation. And yet it was striking that, confronted with this news, the bondmarket, which is usually hypersensitive to the possibility of inflation, didnot sell off. In fact, bonds rallied, with yields dropping to 6.04 percent.            You could say that this was just irrational. But when you look a littledeeper at the productivity numbers, the evidence for real inflationarypressures starts to look rather sketchy. On a year-over-year basis (rather thanquarter-to-quarter), nonfarm productivity was up 2.9 percent, compared to 2.7percent in the first quarter, and unit labor costs were up just 1.4 percent.(Again, what's important is that increases in productivity outpace increases inlabor costs. Though not by too much.) So, from that perspective the economydoesn't appear to be overheating.            Still, the combination of this report and last week's Employment Cost Index(which showed worker compensation rising faster than at any time since 1991)should throw at least a hint of caution into the New Economy advocates, thosewho are convinced that inflation is permanently dead and that the computer hasforever revolutionized the productivity equation. We're still in the middle ofa remarkable run. But a boom built on productivity improvements is real. A boombuilt on easy money is not. And distinguishing betweeen the two is the mostimportant thing Alan Greenspan can do right now.
