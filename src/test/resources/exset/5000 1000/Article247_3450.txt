                                 The Day Ganja Defeated Wiener Schnitzel                        Dear Chris,            I want to close this quite enjoyable week with a plea for clemency. Let'sforgive Miller on two points.            One is his valuation of rock's lesser-known collaborators (Glenn Matlock,John Cale, etc.). At this point, these come mostly as correctives to what'sbeen drummed into our heads by countless bios and Time-Life specials.Flowers in the Dustbin is idiosyncratic enough that it's hard to imaginesomeone taking it as a definitive text on rock history--believing that Lou Reedwas a Warhol puppet or that Johnny Rotten's rheumy dynamism was simply aproduct of the Situationists. (And yes, the latter perspective does owe morethan a little to Savage's England's Dreaming . This must have been saidbefore, but if someone named Jon Savage wasn't born to write about the SexPistols, I don't know who was.)            I've also come to appreciate the subtlety of Miller's critique a bit moreover the past few days. While doing his best to expose the men behind thecurtain--Ertegun, Warhol, McLaren--Miller rarely falls into the pat stance ofso many social-crit rock writers who, unable to trust their ears, rely uponunspoken formulations like Commercial = Sucks and judge all music accordingly.Miller actually tries to address the nuances that make a music succeed or fail,which is pretty uncommon in his milieu. He recognizes that even prefab,target-marketed music can have life-changing effects on people.            As far as the reggae chapter, I'm not sure how much slack to cut him. Is theinclusion of reggae a worthy redress of a common rock-historical oversight, oris it a cursory attempt to include still another music that discerningwhite college-educated guys tend to have in their record collections?            I think you're right that Miller includes Jamaica--as befits his mode ofintellectual genealogy--mostly to represent rock's effect on the world andvice-versa. The chapter even ends by imagining musicians in Kingston, SoPaulo, and Capetown, as "rock and roll rebels in Third World disguise." Butthat's pretty parlous ground to dash over in eight pages. Miller obviouslyenjoys the moment of The Harder They Come knocking The Sound ofMusic out of Jamaica's No. 1 slot--implying it was a triumph ofrock-'n'-roll attitude over goody-goody moralism. Of course, it's also atriumph of Jimmy Cliff over Julie Andrews, ganja over Wiener schnitzel,and--isn't this a bit more important?--local art over cultural imperialism.            Moralism is certainly alive in today's rock (mostly around subjects like thedeath penalty and Tibet), but it seems quite ably offset by crass irony, sillyprovocation, emotional retardation of most pop culture. If we're going tocompare the moralism of this multimillion dollar culture industry with that at,say, Oscar Night, I know which one I prefer.            The Carter administration: What a time to first hear "All Tomorrow'sParties"! Energy crisis. Iran hostages. Village People. I think I first heardit during Reagan's second term. Crack. AIDS. Huey Lewis. How differently didMiller, you, and I hear it? Obviously, popular music needs some contextin which to be understood. But more and more of these disengaged bits of audioexpressionism are floating around us, daring us to make sense of them. Tolisten intelligently, which I believe is still possible, you have to drawparallels, be alert to links and exchanges, respond both musically andsocially. Which--to answer one of the first questions you asked me--is onereason why it's hard to write well about rock.            But maybe we're all being too sloppy with this term "rock." Maybe Miller'sactually right to end his chronology at 1977, a year that most of myfavorite trends in this, er, "cultural form" began. Did all of the music,personalities, and ideas that first captivated me--the Sex Pistols, GrandmasterFlash, Public Enemy--do nothing but recycle Miller's paradigms? That would suremake things easy for us content providers, but I don't think so. Still, maybeall this newer music--born of new technologies, multiculti babble, youth/mediafeedback loops--falls under some other rubric we have yet to define. The reallytrenchant analyses often come years later. Maybe the etymological evolutionfrom "rock 'n' roll" to "rock" to whatever else we decide to call this intense,edgy, corrupt, joyful form of musical expression is long overdue.            I'm accepting suggestions.            Yours,Chris
