                                 Clinton's Kid Stuff                           The Toughest Job in theWorld , produced by Young & Rubicam Inc. for the Advertising CouncilInc./The Coalition for America's Children PSAs.                           The Toughest Job in theWorld gives us a different Bill Clinton. This isn't a politician trying toshrug off the shroud of scandal. This is a hard-working man, an engaged parenttrying to do the best he can in a world where the odds are stacked up againsthim and others like him. The issues the spot focuses on--children, theireducation and development--are what the public really cares about, say thepolls. The picture it presents of Clinton--as father, as promoter of family andcommunity values--is one that the White House has been trying to push for atleast a year.            As Clinton's luck would haveit, Madison Avenue and big media have partnered to extend the president'sre-election themes of family and community at no cost to him. These ads,created by the nonprofit Ad Council, will be run free on television, radio, andin print as part of a public-service campaign on behalf of children. And thisflagship 60-second spot does at least as much to promote the president'sfamily-values image as it does to jump-start that public-service campaign.            Recalling the DickMorris-Bob Squier spots for the '96 election, this one opens with Clinton at apodium complete with waving flag. It moves on to shots of oil paintings ofLincoln and Washington, implying that these men, like Clinton, who's doing thevoice-over, were also charged with doing "the toughest job in the world." Theconsequences of failure, Clinton tells us, "could be serious."            Cresting around thatportentous pronouncement, our expectations are confounded by what comes next.The job in question isn't the presidency, Clinton tells us: "It's being aparent." Appropriately, the camera no longer focuses on the president alone. Ahome-video-style shot of him with wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea (who'sclearly going to be seen more in the second term than in the first) is followedby one of the first lady, seen next to the president, talking of "drugs and allthe other pressures facing our children." The ensuing images and words evoketwo of her favorite themes: a wider investment in our children (it takes avillage, stupid) and the importance of reading (one of her--and theadministration's--major education initiatives).            Shots of a politicallycorrect mix of kids, of a mother with her teen-age daughter, of an adultreading to a youngster, are followed by a series that shows the first coupleinteracting with the children on whose behalf they are crusading. Where thefirst set of shots was in black and white, the second is in vibrant color--theaim being, of course, to equate involvement with warmth. The first lady speaksof the "350 wonderful organizations" that have come together "to help parentsraise good kids," an idea that infuriates ideologues on the right, especiallywhen it comes from Hillary. Her husband, speaking to the camera and viavoice-over, invites viewers to help: This isn't just about parents doing thebest they can; everyone, young adults and seniors alike, can "make adifference." An e-mail address and a phone number invite viewers to take up thegauntlet and become involved.            Theimages of the president and the first lady together, of their obvious bond,speak volumes about their commitment to family values. What would have beenpowerful in an explicitly political ad is even more powerful in an ostensiblynonpolitical context. For Clinton, this kind of image-making couldn't have comeat a better time: The scandals aside, he was recently attacked in anAtlantic Monthly article about the adverse effects of welfare reform onkids. The author, Peter Edelman, was once Clinton's top advisor on the issue(Edelman's wife was responsible for bringing Hillary Clinton onto the board ofthe Children's Defense Fund). This spot leaves little doubt that Bill Clinton,like the coalition for which he is speaking, is "fighting for the children,"that he's trying to do well at the toughest job in the world. It might alsohelp him do better for himself.                           --Robert Shrum
