                                 Lighten Up, Steve Brill                        Tucker:            Ooh, Steve Brill. Do I really want to say what I think about him and thenhave to read a 25-page analysis of my various journalistic indiscretions inBrill's Con Job ? Including a discography of all the free copies ofBeastie Boys CDs I received in the mail and kept?!? Even though we neveractually ran a review?!?            The trouble with him and his self-police force is they have no sense ofhumor. Ombudsmen? Agate-type footnotes? Geez. My heart aches for the days ofthe old Spy , when columnists hid behind pseudonyms, skewered Abe "I'mWriting as Bad as I Can" Rosenthal and other Times men, and recounteddelicious personal details about editors I'd never heard of who left thebathroom without washing their hands, etc. Instead, we get pots calling kettlesblack; and not just pots but rich and powerful pots with rich and powerfulfriends. Lighten up, Steve. Let he who is without synergy cast the firststone.            For what it's worth, my somewhat obvious street-corner view is that theconflicts of interests that drive Brill nuts are inevitable. Media mergers andgobblings-up and the like have made it impossible for us to do our jobs ifwe're obligated to disqualify ourselves from covering companies or people a) wedo business with, b) we have a personal relationship or history with, or c) arein competition with. I'm not saying I like it; I'm just saying there it is.Where Brill goes wrong is in failing to distinguish between the most innocuousand naturally occurring conflicts from those lipstick-smeared ones that couldhave and should have been avoided. In the former category, I put, say,Entertainment Weekly 's decision to review the Pokmon movie, which wasreleased by Warner Bros.; what's it gonna do--not run a review? In the latter,I put the Times ' decision to keep Bernie Weinraub on the movie businessbeat all that time after his wife ascended to the ranks of studio muckety-muck.And I won't even mention the sort of logrolling that routinely goes on in thebook-review biz, the most recent example of which involves a certain D.C.-basedweekly political magazine that shall remain nameless. But not shameless.            Into the latter category, alas, I must also put at least one of your currentemployers (which each seem to be piece of a big, honking conglomerate, as ismine). Can you tell that I'm dying to talk about Alex Unpronounceable LastName's Talk piece in yesterday's Times ? In a way I admire whatTina Brown is doing (he said respectfully, protecting his future jobprospects). Rather than mincing around on the edges of the conflict-of-interestminefield, she's charging down the middle, ignoring the explosions to her leftand right. What I don't admire is her pretending, however energetically, thatshe's doing something other than shilling for the Weinsteins. Knowing that[insert blonde starlet here] appears on the cover because she's got a moviecoming out doesn't make me want to read the story less--or more. Whereas Tina'sinsisting that she put Elizabeth Hurley in an extraterrestrial fashion spreadbecause it was a cute idea and not because she starred in My FavoriteMartian , a film available right now on video from Miramax's parentcompany, Disney, totally and completely strains credibility. My advice: Outyourself. Come clean. Tattoo "Bob" on one set of knuckles and "Harv" on theother, like Belushi in Blues Brothers . It's not as if we'll stop readingthe magazine--or start.            Before I sign off, I must point out my favorite wire story of the week,month, and year. Reuters reported yesterday that a Canadian tourist has filed a$1.5 million lawsuit because his penis was allegedly crushed in a Starbucks.No, not in a roaster--he was in the bathroom making, as they say, agrande , when he reached back for the toilet paper and inadvertently gothimself caught between the seat and bowl.            But did he wash his hands? Brill, get me rewrite.            Regards,Evan
