                                 Nut Cases            Everybody leads with the Monica-related maneuverings taking place on CapitolHill. The general consensus is that the public's support for PresidentClinton's remaining in office has withstood the airing of his grand jurytestimony and indeed, has even grown a bit stronger. This has, report thepapers, encouraged Democrats to seek a compromise outcome short ofimpeachment--say, having Clinton testify before the House Judiciary Committeewith a guarantee that he wouldn't be removed from office, although perhapscensured and/or fined. The Washington Post reports that former White Housecounsel--and Washington Wise Man--Lloyd Cutler has been working the Hill for acensure deal as an unofficial Clinton rep.            But Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde is quoted by USA Today andthe New York Timessaying that talk of such a deal is "very premature." Hyde expects a committeevote recommending impeachment hearings to come in early October, with thehearings beginning after the November election. The NYT explains thepolitics of that schedule: it would allow Republicans to avoid looking too softor too hard on the president before the elections, while still forcingDemocrats to cast a pre-election vote on Clinton's fate.            The papers report that as part of its anti-impeachment lobbying, the WhiteHouse legal team went on the offensive yesterday, writing a letter to Hydeaccusing Ken Starr of deliberately leaving exculpatory statements he'd turnedup out of the formal report he tendered to Congress. "Ultimately, we just gotthe sex," a presidential advisor is quoted in the LAT. Exhibit A of somethingin evidence but not in the report is Lewinsky's statement to the grand jurythat "no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for mysilence." The LAT notes, referring to the Starr office's response, thatwhen this statement was paraphrased in the report the modifier "explicitly" wasadded. The WP notes that the Starr office sarcastically observed thatthe Clinton team now appears to find Lewinsky credible on some topics but notothers.            The papers report that at a White House East Room reception, Nelson Mandelasaid that South Africa, Africa and the entire world supported Bill Clinton. Itwas, notes the NYT , "the kind of emotional endorsement that Clinton hastrouble getting these days from members of his own party."            The Wall Street Journal reports that China has banned a kind offoreign joint venture that was the principal way such telecommunications firmsas Sprint had begun gaining entry into Chinese markets. The move is the latestin a series of protectionist steps that are worsening the business climate forU.S. companies and widening the U.S.-China trade gap. The trend is puzzling,the paper notes, in that the Asian economic crisis has already made foreigninvestors leery of investing in China. A WP story says that trade is quicklybecoming the biggest issue between the U.S. and China. According to U.S. stats,the U.S. deficit with China is second only to the one with Japan. China saysU.S statistics are exaggerated. The big leverage the U.S. has to remedy theproblem is, according to the Post , that--especially with other Asianmarkets in such disarray--America is China's most important export market.            Although the NYT 's off-lead reports that any U.S.-Iran thaw is stilla long way off, LAT 's front, and inside stories at all the other papers,report that Iran's president Mohammed Khatemi told reporters yesterday that thefatwa issued against Salman Rushdie for blaspheming Islam was "completelyfinished."            A front-page NYT story shows that private and suburban school parentsstill lead the way in fighting against threats to their children so slight asto be all but invisible to ordinary folk. The latest bogeyman: peanut butter allergies. A number of elite schools in theNew York area, the paper reports, have declared peanut-free cafeterias. Othersserve peanut butter sandwiches only in a special designated area. Some schoolshave stored syringes of antidote around their buildings. And thought is beinggiven to providing separate instructional materials to peanut-allergicchildren. One lawyer who represents many New York private schools is concerned,says the paper, that peanut allergies might qualify as a disability that mustbe accommodated under the American with Disabilities Act. The NYC publicschools have done none of these things, largely because no one has complained.(Although peanuts are not served because they are deemed a choking hazard.) TheTimes notes that according to the Center of Disease Control, from 1979through 1995, there were but 88 deaths nationwide from all forms of foodallergy combined.
