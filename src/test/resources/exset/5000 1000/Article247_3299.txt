                                 FDR's and ER's Sentimental Politics                        Dear Marjorie,            I must have overcompressed my last letter, because you've read as a singleargument what I meant as two: (1) By "Gingrichian," I meant profiting offgovernmental power that is not really your property. Maybe that's a problem,maybe not. But Eleanor's using the money she made to reward like-mindedphilanthropists (hence, buy political support) doesn't change the ethics of it.(2) For someone intent on remaking the social order, Eleanor was working with acuriously narrow definition of privilege, a definition that left her lifestylelargely untouched.            Another thing: I didn't say FDR was dictatorial, but anyone who sent afriendly greeting to an American Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden in 1934 (adiscovery for which Cook deserves great credit) was worth keeping an eye on.The most high-handed moment of his presidency--the attempt to pack the SupremeCourt in 1937--is made the worse by his almost insane assertion that theSupreme Court was one of the "three horses" pulling the New Deal "plow."Without calling him undemocratic, one can wonder what his idea of democracywas.            The best point either of us made all week was your Monday one about thedivision of labor between presidents and their wives. You asked,                           Did the bifurcated Roosevelt White House do a disservice inproviding a model for later administrations, in which poor folks and childrenand the lame and the halt were insidiously sentimentalized as women'swork?                         My answer would be: Yes, we're still stuck with that model--although Iwouldn't blame Eleanor for it. And I'm less bothered by the gender stereotypingit entails than by the good cop/bad cop tactics through which it gets playedout.            Because sentimental politics can be a way to fob off rhetoricalsolutions on people demanding practical ones. Sometimes this is a good way todefuse radicalism which would otherwise be hard to answer. When the BonusMarchers came back to Washington, FDR couldn't tell them to take a hike, but hecouldn't cave in to them, either, without unleashing similar protests acrossthe country. So he gave them three-hots-and-a-cot across the Potomac and sentEleanor out to sing "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" with them.            But sometimes sentimental politics is merely a way to salve one's consciencewhen real action is possible and one would prefer to do nothing. Cook feels FDRdid much less than he could have to help European refugees in the late 1930s.She's right. But I would ask whether Eleanor's public hand-wringing didn'tprovide him with cover for his inaction. (One note: If I left the impressionyesterday that Eleanor's pacifism extended to support for unilateraldisarmament , I should be clear that--particularly as war approached--itdecidedly did not.)            You're right that it's race where the interplay between rhetorical andprogrammatic politics was most complex. Cook snorts throughout at the demandsof FDR's advisers, particularly Jubal Early's grandson Steve, that "racialetiquette" be respected. But at some level she understands that it wasa matter of etiquette. The guerrilla warfare of manners that Eleanorwaged--showing up in public with Mary McLeod Bethune and Walter White, turningthe White House into a place where black people were routinely seen coming inand going out the front door--may have been the most effective way to strikeagainst racism at a time of severely limited options. (Of course, it alonecould never carry the day. Bull Connor advised FDR on Southern matters untilFDR's death, ran Birmingham for almost three decades after Eleanor's sit-downprotest, and was even the Democratic National Committeeman for Alabama duringthe Kennedy administration.)            You also noted early on that some of the "mixedness" of Eleanor'srelationship with FDR was lost in Volume 2 . I liked this book betterthan the first, but I think you're right. I never quite figured out, forexample, what the particular crisis was that left Hick worried that Eleanorwould ditch FDR on the eve of re-election--although it's another tidbit to addto our Clinton-Roosevelt Parallels file. Poor Hick, bereft of career, living ina perpetual state of low-intensity jiltedness ("Miss you so much," runs thetypical Eleanor letter, "but you'd hate it here so don't come "),traveling the barrooms of the country as Eleanor's eyes and ears, remains forme the hero of the book.            Marjorie, it's been a delight to correspond with you this week. Best wishesuntil we meet again--perhaps over Volume 9 of some future 14-volumebiography of Rosalynn Carter.            Yours,            Chris
