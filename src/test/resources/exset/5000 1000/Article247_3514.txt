                                 Nixon's Monica Stonewalls, Part II            Monica Crowley, the Fox News political analyst and author of two books abouther former boss, Richard Nixon, is annoyed with Chatterbox for characterizingher stance toward her plagiarism controversy (see "Nixon's Monica Stonewalls About Plagiarism!") as "stonewalling." She toldChatterbox (who finally reached her today by phone): "I did not stonewall youor the issue." She hadn't returned Chatterbox's earlier queries because she wason vacation, she said; and she'd already explained herself to FelicityBarringer of the New York Times .            But careful readers of Chatterbox's earlier item--about the strikingsimilarities between a recent Op-Ed piece Crowley wrote for the Wall StreetJournal and an essay written 11 years earlier by Paul Johnson forCommentary-- will note that Chatterbox had already allowed for thepossibility that Crowley was on vacation. They will also note that Crowley'scomment as quoted in the Times --that "I have not read" Johnson'spiece--seemed, under the circumstances, to be less than truthful. It was mainlyin reference to this Times quote that Chatterbox was accusing Crowley of"stonewalling." And guess what? Crowley--who confirmed to Chatterbox that she'scurrently writing a Liddy Dole profile for Talk magazine--isstill stonewalling!            To review: No fewer than five passages in Crowley's Op-Ed, a tributeto Nixon pegged to the 25th anniversary of his resignation, were worded in waysthat were identical or nearly identical to passages in the Johnson article.(Scroll down to the bottom of Chatterbox's earlier item to assess the extremely damaging evidence.) It isn'tpossible that Crowley never read Johnson's piece. When the Journalgot wind of the similarities, it published an editor's note saying it wouldn'thave published Crowley's piece had it been aware of the "striking similaritiesin phraseology."            Crowley now says she does not remember making the absolute statement ("Ihave not read") that the Times attributed to her. Her mantra toChatterbox was, "I do not remember reading the [Johnson] piece." Cleverlypretending the accusation against her was that she stole Johnson's ideasabout Nixon, she said that "the concepts in question are shared by those with aknowledgeable background of [Nixon's] life and career." Well, sure, it can wellbe imagined that two people would independently arrive at the (erroneous)idea that Nixon got screwed. What can't be imagined is that two peoplewould independently arrive at the same words to express this idea.            "I understand that there are clear similarities in some of the language use,but I arrived at my conclusions independently and I expressed them that way,"Crowley told Chatterbox. "Nor would I ever submit material from a source forpublication without attribution, without citing it properly."            But surely, Chatterbox sputtered, you must have read Johnson'sarticle. Are you saying you didn't read Johnson's article?            "I don't remember ever reading the piece," Crowley answered.            But that's not possible! Chatterbox said. Lengthy passages are repeatedverbatim, or almost verbatim!            "I acknowledge to you there are similarities in the phraseology," Crowleysaid.            Oh, come on, Chatterbox said. Why not come clean and at least admit that youmust have plagiarized inadvertently?            "I did not plagiarize. Absolutely not."            What about the giveaway Britishism (Johnson is British; Crowley is not) yourepeated--that Nixon emerged from Watergate "with credit"?            "Come on, Tim, I've been using that phrase for a long time."            Chatterbox briefly considered dedicating the rest of his life to finding outwhether Crowley has ever before used the phrase "with credit," and decidedagainst it. Clearly, Crowley wasn't going to do even a Ruth Shalit (i.e., admitplagiarism but say it was inadvertent and trivial), which Chatterbox previouslythought was the minimal amount of self-abnegation such a situation demanded.Crowley was just going to ... stonewall.            It's working. Aside from Chatterbox's rants on the subject, there continuesto be no follow-up to the Times item (and an earlier one by theNew York Post ) in any news outlet tracked by Nexis. This providesfurther evidence that Bob Woodward is wrong when he argues in his new book,Shadow , that lying and obfuscating by public figures is inevitablyself-destructive. Chatterbox remembers writing this before ("Why Clinton WasBetter Off Lying"), but the archival link doesn't seem to be working just now,so he'll just plagiarize himself.
