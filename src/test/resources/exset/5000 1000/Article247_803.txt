                                 Whose Ox is Gore?            With little news breaking on Christmas, the papers lead with dependablyworrisome issues. The Los Angeles Times sets off on a whirlwind tour of troublespots all over the planet (potential violence in Africa, the Balkans, and theMiddle East, economic crisis in Asia and Russia) and frets about the impact ofimpeachment on American stewardship of global stability. The Washington Post reviews weather-induced havoc in the South.The New York Timeslead describes the easy end run that insurance providers have found around thelegally mandated minimum coverage for mental illness. The 1996 Mental HealthParity Act only requires that dollar limits on mental health coverage equalthose for general medical services. So providers and employers simply mete outtreatments in non-monetary denominations, like number of visits and days in thehospital. Congress is expected to close the loopholes next year.            The LAT fronts a four-day-old interview in which Vice President Goreprevaricates about how to handle his role in an impeachment trial. Yes, theConstitution requires him only to preside over the Senate and to break any tiedvote on verdict or procedure. But can he lobby Senators to vote againstimpeachment? Gore opines that it would be "inappropriate" for him to"buttonhole" Senators, but hedges--if he's asked, he will "feel free tocommunicate with them in full." In this spirit of indecision, the interview wasconducted Tuesday, "downplayed" by his aides on Wednesday, and then "embargoed"until the safety of the Christmas news lull. Meanwhile, the piece doesn'tarticulate the stickiest and most obvious of the Vice President's conflicts ofinterest: how Gore's own presidential ambitions could influence his performanceas referee.            The NYT and the LAT front the agreement between Russia andBelarus to merge their currencies, synchronize trade, and relax politicalbarriers. The LAT describes the deal as the first step of a full-onmerger, but the NYT points out that a) it's not really a merger, becausethe plans are just too vague and b) the Belarussians are considerably moregung-ho about it than their Russian counterparts. The deal brings Russia thechance to flex its slackened superpower muscles, but at the cost of providingshelter to Belarus' destitute population, bankrupt government, and bone-dryeconomy. In addition, the LAT notes Belarus President AlexanderLukashenko's dubious record: he extended his term in a dummy referendum, andhas been known to gag the opposition press and imprison dissidents.            The NYT reports inside that U.S. officials have been able to protectan eggshell-fragile cease-fire in Kosovo. An AP story inside the WPreports that Western monitoring forces will continue to saturate the area inorder to prevent more fighting. However, ethnic Albanian rebels seem eager toshatter it at any minute: "We will win or we will turn to dust," says one youngcommander to the Times .            A survey by the WP suggests that Americans tolerate but do notcondone homosexuality. A front-page feature, one in a series on "AmericanValues", maps out the ambivalence many Americans feel about the issue: 72% ofrespondents call "gay sex" unacceptable, but a robust 87% say that homosexualsshould have equal rights and opportunities in the workplace. The piece suggeststhat gay rights may become the same kind of ideological litmus test forelectoral candidates as abortion. However, the ideological confusion reportedin the survey is complicated by unclear statistical reporting: although thecredentials of the pollsters are described at length, the size and nature ofthe sample is not.            The WP front page also reports that PBS stations are no longerrelying on simple tote-bag-giveaways to raise viewer contributions. Instead,stations are scrapping their fusty regulars for fitness experts and self-helpgurus who capture minds and pocketbooks with lectures on "spiritual healing"and "de-toxifying your negative emotions." Reaction within the publictelevision community has ranged from sheepishness to horror. But perhaps thesestations are banking on very, very long-term loyalty.
