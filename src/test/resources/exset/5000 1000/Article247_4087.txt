                                 Does OPEC Have Us Over a Barrel Again?                        It may not be the greatest comeback in business history, but there-ascendance of OPEC is certainly one of the more surprising turnarounds inrecent memory. Back in March, the benchmark price of West Texas Intermediatecrude oil was $13 a barrel, and it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that theability of the world's key oil-producing nations to keep prices high hadforever vanished. In an earlierincarnation of this column, in fact, I argued that the combination of newoil-discovery and oil-recovery technology with the advent of the spot futuresmarket in oil meant that the OPEC's glory days were long gone. So why are oilprices now at $27 a barrel, with consumption actually outpacing production, andthe OPEC nations holding firm?            The simplest answer--and the simplest excuse for that earlier column--isthat no one ever suggested that transformations in the oil industry were goingto have the effect of repealing the laws of supply and demand. Oil prices havedoubled because the global economy has made a powerful recovery in the past 12months. The U.S. economy has grown faster than it did in 1998, Europe is nowhumming along nicely, Japan has crawled out of recession (at least for themoment), and much of Asia is now moving again. (Some predictions call forKorea, for instance, to grow at 12 percent next year.) Since oil prices areprospective, the markets do not anticipate a global slowdown any time soon. Andthe more oil consumers want, the more expensive it will become.            Until, that is, more oil becomes available, either through expandedproduction by the leading oil-producing nations or expanded exploitation ofexisting reserves by the giant oil multinationals. And here's where the"foregone conclusion" looks a little less foregone, primarily because both OPECand non-member countries, such as Mexico and Norway, have shown restraint inthe face of rising prices. The history of OPEC, at least since the mid-1980s,has been one of massive cheating on the part of its members, who have regularlyviolated their production quotas in order to reap as much profit as possible.That, of course, has sent prices tumbling. At the same time, OPEC has had animpossible time dealing with its non-member competitors, who were prone toflood the market at any time.            Prices have also stayed high because the major oil companies, having beenburned in the past, have been temperate in expanding their exploration andproduction budgets. Although most of the majors will do more capital spendingin 2000 and 2001 than they did last year, their annual budgets for the nextcouple of years will probably not equal what they were as recently as 1996.That's what a few of years of $13-a-barrel prices will do for you.            Still, there's another way to look at the relatively tempered way the oilgiants are expanding those budgets, and that is that they do not see pricesgoing, as some have suggested, to $35 a barrel. In fact, the oil companiesappear to be planning on prices between $20 and $25 a barrel, which would meanthat while filling up your tank is going to be more expensive than it was ninemonths ago, any inflationary impact from oil prices will be seriouslymuted.            There's no guarantee that the oil companies are right. But there's anexcellent chance that they are, because the structural transformations in theworld oil market are real, and so too is the fact that running a cartel has notgotten any easier in the past couple of years. Price-fixing cartels can workquite well in the short term. But over the long run the incentive to cheat issimply too high, and the measures of coercion and punishment simply too weak,to keep everyone in line. At the moment, the memories of what low oil priceswere like are probably strong enough to keep Venezuela, for instance, frompumping oil as fast as it can. But memories fade, and cash in the bank cansometimes look like forever.
