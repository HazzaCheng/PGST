                                 Name That Scandal: And the Winner Is ...            Chatterbox has harnessed the vast power of the Net in search of a handy,irresistible name for the Lewinsky-Tripp-Willey-Clinton scandal, andChatterbox's pathetic little hard drive now overflows with the results--morethan 215 responses, containing no less than 209 distinct suggestions. All wecan say is, For God's sake, stop! The contest is over!                        Explicitly disobeying Chatterbox's instructions, many entries contained thedespised "-gate" suffix, including the three most popular entries--"Fornigate"(23 submissions), "Tailgate" (13), and "Zippergate" (12). Despite theinsubordination, Chatterbox actually likes each of these; "Fornigate" may wellwind up the name that wins out in popular usage. But somehow we can't see theNew York Times adopting it. So Chatterbox will pass over these excellententries, taking the advice of contest entrant Jonathan Weisberg to look for aname that might at least conceivably wind up in a high-school history book.Plus, Chatterbox doesn't want to have to buy the 23 copies of Leaves ofGrass it would take to reward the Fornigate brigade.            Several other entries also fail the "history book" test. "Whitefluid" is toodirty for anyone except Slate's Scott Shuger to use, as are "Pussygate,""Billygoat," "Deep Throat," "Starr 69," and one of Chattterbox's favorites,"Come-a-lot," with its evocative, ironic historical reference. (Some Chatterboxreaders seem to have spent a bit too much time going through the X-rated binsdown at the video store.) The same goes for "Moby Dick," despite the usefulallusion to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's Ahab-like pursuit of proof ofthe president's sinfulness. Chatterbox also likes "Incredible Sucking Sound,"but doesn't want to annoy Ross Perot. Anyway, wasn't it a "giant suckingsound"?            "Daughtergate" is cute but ugly. "Interncourse" doesn't exactly flow easilyoff the tongue, while "Wag the Intern" rests too heavily on an ephemeralpop-culture reference that will be lost on future generations. "PotusInterruptus" is pretty good, but too long for convenient headline usage. Thesame goes for "Intern Explorer," which might also attract unwanted scrutinyfrom the Department of Justice's antitrust division. Chatterbox likes "TheJohnson Presidency," "Sexpot Dome," and "Nookiegate," the last so reminiscentof New York Observer writer Philip Weiss' prescient admonition to thepress: "Follow the nookie." But no.            Some of the entries are too awful to actually list here. Here is a list ofthem: "Ejacugate," "Whit 'n' tits," "Suck 'n' duck," "Fellation Conflagration,""Clintonlingus," and "Spewinsky." One reader offered "Lobster Thermidor," whichrequired a long explanation (you don't want to know). Chatterbox was puzzled byanother entry: "Screw You." One or two brilliant entries may have been lostbecause they were MIME. (Chatterbox is non-MIME, though it doesn't make a bigdeal of it.)            Numerous entries played on the names of the special prosecutor("Starr-gate," "Starr Chamber," "Starr Trek," "Starr Grazing") and thescandal's mad secret taper ("Trippwire," "Tripplash"). "Starr Tripp" combinesboth names nicely. But Chatterbox believes neither Starr nor Linda Tripp willgo down in history as the scandal's central figures--although "Trippwire,"submitted by at least four readers, actually packs quite a bit of info aboutthe scandal into a small package.            That leaves a few slightly more anodyne but serviceable (sorry) entries.Both "The Clintern Scandal" and "The Clintern Affair" will do fine. "TheLewinsky Affair" fits in with the American tradition of naming scandals afterunlucky people or objects, and it sounds great in French. But Chatterboxprefers "Flytrap." It's short. It makes at least a bit of a joke. It canaccommodate the possibility that Clinton yielded to temptation as well as the(not completely incompatible) possibility that the whole thing was a vicioussetup. And it was only submitted by one reader, as far as Chatterbox cantell.            So Chatterbox wanders off into El Nino in search of the sole remaining copyof Leaves of Grass in the National Capital Area to send to "Susan" atIndex Publishing Group in San Diego. Congratulations. Thanks as well to all whodared to share their good and, more courageously, their bad ideas.
