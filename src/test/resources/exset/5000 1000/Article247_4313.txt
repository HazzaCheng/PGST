                                 Gore Mellows                                             Editor's note : Jacob Weisberg has filed a report fromThursday's debate among the GOP presidential candidates. Click here to readit.                        DURHAM, N.H--A good night for Al Gore. His progress in this, the fifthDemocratic debate, was finally arriving at a reasonable tone. As in theprevious encounters, Gore was highly critical of his rival. But this time hewas able to be critical of Bill Bradley without coming off as smarmy orhectoring. Gore made all his familiar criticisms--that Bradley wasn't puttingany money aside for Medicare, that his health-care plan wouldn't covereverybody, and that when the going got tough in the Senate, Bradley got going.But absent was about 80 percent of the sense of artificiality thatcharacterized Gore's earlier performances. Gore dispensed with the vocalizedsighs and weary head-shakings of the Meet the Pressdebate. This meant that you could listen to what he was saying withouthaving to spend the whole time disliking him.            Gore also included one new attack on Bradley that was very much on point. Hefinally took the advice of "Kausfiles" and nailed Bradley for opposing welfare reform in 1996.Given the opportunity to ask Bradley a direct question, Gore asked whether hisopponent thought he made a mistake on three big votes in the Senate--in favorof the Reagan budget cuts, against the use of force resolution the Gulf War,and against welfare reform. Bradley responded with a stream of gobbledygook,the thrust of which was that he stood by his decisions and would do the sameagain, even with the benefit of hindsight.            "I think all three of them were a mistake," Gore responded, neatlyunderscoring the lameness of Bradley's answer. "I think that people weretrapped in the old welfare system. ... Saddam Hussein would still be in Kuwaitif we had tried to rely on sanctions. Those budget cuts from Ronald Reagan hurtNew Hampshire."            Peter Jennings, who was a somewhat off-key moderator throughout the event,then asked a pointless thumbsucker of a follow-up: "How large a mistake is apresident allowed to make?" The occasion not being a seminar at the KennedySchool, both candidates wisely ignored him. Jennings' other moment of weirdnesswas asking Bradley "what you really thought when Gore held out his hand" in thelast debate--as if he was hosting some kind of debate post-game show ratherthan the debate itself. Infinitely less adept at stoking an argument than TimRussert, Jennings kept trying to get the candidates to repeat highlights fromtheir previous session. But perhaps because arguing offends his sense ofpoliteness, he kept trying to change the subject when they did start scrapping.Perhaps Jennings was confused about how to handle a broadcast that didn'tinvolve any costume changes.            His pathetic answer on welfare aside, Bradley turned in a strong performanceas well. Substantively, I thought his best moment was his question to Goreabout why the vice president wouldn't join him in supporting the registrationand licensing of all handguns. Gore's lame response was that "it doesn't have aprayer of ever becoming law." Bradley then delivered a lecture on what it meansto be a leader. "Where would the country be today if Franklin Roosevelt saidSocial Security's too difficult to do? Of if Lyndon Johnson said Medicaid's toodifficult to do? The essence of leadership is taking something that isdifficult and making it possible because you engage the American people in anattempt to make it happen."            Bradley's other best riff came after Gore asked him again why he hadn't putmoney aside for Medicare. After explaining that continued strong economicgrowth might vaporize the problem, Bradley tried to cast Gore as a small-mindedinside-the-Beltway character for dwelling on the point. "When I hear you talk,Al, it reminds me of a Washington bunker. I think you're in the Washingtonbunker. ... The Democratic Party shouldn't be in the Washington bunker withyou."            Canned as it probably was, this was a wicked sound bite. It would have beenmore effective, though, if Gore had been badgering Bradley the way he has inprevious debates. But for the first time, Gore wasn't the clear aggressor--andBradley wasn't clearly the aggrieved.
