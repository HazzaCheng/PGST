                                 Willey, Adversary                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with the grand jury appearance ofKathleen Willey. The New YorkTimes covers the Willey questioning in its lead too, but goes higher inthe story with the news that President Clinton may be headed for a grand juryappearance himself. The Los Angeles Times leads with the news that the INSannounced that none of a new batch of Border Patrol agents is being assigned toSan Diego--because the agency feels that illegal immigration there has "reacheda level of control." The paper notes that some Southern Californians, includingsome area politicians, dispute this, noting that while San Diego's illegalentries seem to have dropped, nearby areas of inland California have seen theirillegal immigration arrests skyrocket.            Yesterday's WP said that Willey was coming to the Starr grand jury,but nobody predicted this soon. The papers seize on various indications that inWilley, Starr seems to have at last found a cooperative witness, noting thatshe did not appear to have her own lawyer with her ( USAT ), that shearrived in a Starr van (the WP ), and was accompanied inside thecourthouse by prosecutors (the WP and NYT ). The WP notes the White House projected an air ofunconcern, quoting spokesman Joe Lockhart's comment: "When people tell thetruth, they tell the truth. It doesn't matter who drove you there." But thePost also notes that the White House was mum about how Willey, aclerical volunteer, managed to wangle the private appointment in November, 1993with Clinton to discuss her husband's financial troubles and her sudden needfor a job, during which, she charges in her Jones case deposition, he gropedher.            The Post observes that Willey's appearance indicates Starr iswidening his investigation beyond the allegations involving Monica Lewinsky todetermine whether President Clinton has testified truthfully in his Paula Jonesdeposition about other women as well. Everybody reports that Starr is alsointerested in determining if Willey was--as she stated in her Jones caseaffidavit--approached by Democratic fund-raiser Nathan Landow in an effort toinfluence her to back off her grope charge.            It has been widely reported that a woman named Julie Steele now says Willeyasked her to falsely claim that she was told by Willey about the incident notlong after it happened. But USAT says that it has found another Willey friendwho says Willey told her of the incident shortly after it allegedly took place.On the other hand, the paper also notes that in her 1995 testimony inconnection with a lawsuit over her late husband's estate, Willey says she neverhad a conversation with anyone in Washington about her husband's financialreversals.            The NYT front reports that sixIraqis who worked with the CIA in plots against Saddam Hussein have nowbeen declared threats to U.S. national security and hence subject todeportation, in a ruling so secret that their lawyers aren't allowed to readit.            Another Times front-page piece describes how fear of litigation hasmade high school guidance counselors much more hesitant to passalong information about applicants to college admissions personnel. "They'llwrite that Johnny took these courses and was a great student," remarks oneexpert in the field, "but they won't tell you that Johnny burned down thegym."            The Wall Street Journal "Tax Report" says that the number oftax cases referred to the Justice Department in which taxpayers have simplyrefused to recognize the basic legality of the income tax has doubled over thepast three years.            And the Journal 's piece about the upcoming Blumenthal vs. Drudge libel suit quotes First Amendmentscholar Floyd Abrams as saying, "If one were rewriting libel law today, onewould try to write it to assure that the false statements of Matt Drudge weretreated as libel." And what exactly would that rewrite say? You know, thatwouldn't allow Matt Drudge to say what he says, but would allow Floyd Abrams tosay what he says.            The WP reports that according to a new GAO report, in 1995-96, $8.5million worth of food stamps were issued to more than 25,000 dead people.            Both the NYT and WP report that when asked to identify himselfby reporters in front of the courthouse where the Starr grand jury is located,Kathleen Willey's son said he was "the sausage king of Chicago." TheTimes is stumped by this, but the Post gets it: he's quoting aline Matthew Broderick used in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
