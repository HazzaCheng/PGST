                                 Internet: Lots of Balls            The Washington Post leads with Washington, D.C., officials'decision to reopen two homicide cases and their pledge to revamp the city'ssupervision of 150 group homes for the mentally disabled, all in response to aSunday Post story revealing that in the nation's capital, officialsroutinely don't investigate the suspicious deaths of retarded people. TheLos AngelesTimes lead is what the Post went with yesterday: the decision byAT&T to give competing Internet service providers access to its high-speedcable network. The New York Timesruns this inside, leading instead with the trend in many states to aggressivelyenforce truancy laws that threaten parents with fines and jail time. The storystuns early with this statistic: Last year, more than one-third of Detroit'spublic school students missed more than a month of classes. USA Today ,which also runs AT&T inside, leads with the claim that the Federal ElectionCommission will have increasing trouble doing its job of enforcing federalelection laws because of the upsurge of work brought about by the mostexpensive election cycle ever.            The Post lead points out the limits of good journalism when itreminds the reader that Washington, D.C., still hasn't implemented the reformsit promised in response to a Post series done earlier this year on abusein those group homes. Obviously, the city needs to bring in people with moreinvestigative talent and a better sense of the bureaucracy than those callingthe shots now. How about hiring (in jobs with real power) some of thePost reporters who keep nailing these stories?            The USAT FEC lead raises more questions than it answers: Why exactlyis this election cycle producing more work for the agency? The story mentionsthe rise of complaints about "issue ads," but is that the sole cause? And whatdo independent experts think? The only people quoted by name in the story areFEC personnel, which is less than convincing since it's in the interest ofevery government agency to cry being underbudgeted and understaffed.            The WP and LAT front, and the NYT reefers, word that atthe moment, the Mars Polar Lander is still MIA. The papers report that there isgrowing concern among project scientists that the craft will not complete its$165 million mission. One question: Why don't the stories mention themanufacturer of the craft? When an airliner crashes, the papers quicklyannounce that it's a Boeing or an Airbus--why should this be different?            For the second time in a week, a NYT front-pager about Congress'performance this year is brutally frank, appearing under the headline "HEALTHINDUSTRY SEES WISH LIST MADE INTO LAW."            A pair of WP front-pagers emphasize that taxes are looming large inthe Gore vs. Bradley battle. Gore, says the paper, is charging that Bradleywill have to raise taxes in order to finance his health-care plan, and Bradleyhas chosen not to rule out an increase. The Bradley story serves up a memorableline from Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, whocalls Bradley "Dukakis with a jump shot."            In its "Heard on the Street" column, the Wall Street Journal makes a great observation aboutAT&T's likely announcement today of an IPO of a tracking stock tied to itswireless business: underwriters of such deals tend to be firms that have in thepast given good ratings to the issuing company. Which of course means thoseratings aren't exactly reliable for the rest of us.            The LAT 's "Column One" details a corollary of Russia's constitutionalprovision that no member of its parliament can be prosecuted for a crime whilein office: One hundred and five of this year's candidates are convicts and fourothers are wanted by police. It would have been nice if the story had mentionedwhat sort of immunity is enjoyed by members of the U.S. Congress and indeed howmany, if any, are convicted felons.            The LAT business front reports that that Disney Internet executivewho was arrested a few months ago by the FBI on charges of using the Internetto solicit sex from a minor has a defense ready to go for his trial this week.He will claim that the Web is a massive masquerade ball and that he neverexpected that anybody portraying themselves as a minor there would actually beone.            Sunday's NYT was more than a little fascinated with the topic ofwhether or not companies with "20th Century" in their names would change withthe times. So fascinated that it ran not one, but two stories on the apparentlybottomless topic, one in the "Money and Business" section and one in the "Weekin Review."
