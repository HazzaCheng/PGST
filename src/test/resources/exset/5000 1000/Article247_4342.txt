                                 Pay Up, Shrum!            On Meet the Press yesterday, Gore adviser Robert Shrum* attemptedmanfully to deny that his candidate had ever suggested he'd make support of hispolicy on gays in the military a "litmus test" for nomination to the JointChiefs of Staff. All Gore was doing, Shrum said, was restating theconstitutional principle that the Chiefs are obliged to obey their commander inchief:                           What he said ... was that he would insist that people appointed tothe Joint Chiefs of Staff agree to support his policy as president. He neversaid in the New Hampshire debate that he would inquire into their personalconvictions. His litmus test is a constitutional one, civilian control of themilitary ... I defy you to find a place in that transcript where he ever saidhe would inquire into someone's personal position. ... I'll bet you 10 bucks.Find him saying that he's going to examine their personalconvictions.                        Nice try, Bob! But the transcript of the New Hampshire debate makes itpretty damn clear that Gore was saying exactly what Shrum said he didn't say.The video clip played by MTP host Tim Russert might not have nailed theissue down (it showed Gore declaring, "I would insist before appointing anybodyto the Joint Chiefs of Staff that that individual support my policy."). But thediscussion that precedes the clip does. The whole context was Peter Jennings'question about whether Gore or Bradley would apply a "litmus test" to JointChiefs nominees like that occasionally applied, controversially, to SupremeCourt nominees. In the context of the Supreme Court, of course, "litmus test"clearly means an inquiry into a potential nominee's personal convictions--on,say, abortion or civil rights--prior to their nomination.            Gore said he had "rejected the notion of litmus tests on the Supreme Courtby saying there are ways to find out the kind of judgment somebody has withoutposing specific litmus tests." He then said:                           I think that it's a little different where the Joint Chiefs ofStaff are concerned, because you're not interfering with an independentjudicial decision. As commander in chief, a president is giving orders, ineffect, or he is the superior of the officers that are reporting to thecommander in chief in the chain of command. I would try to bring about the kindof change in policy, on the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, that PresidentHarry Truman brought about after World War II in integrating the military .And I think that would require those who wanted to serve in on the positionof--on the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be in agreement with that policy. So,yes. [Emphasis added.]                        This isn't quite a smoking gun, but it's mighty close. As Gore's boss mightsay, it all depends on what the definition of "in agreement with" is. It wasclear to me, watching the debate, that Gore meant that the nominee's personalviews had to be "in agreement." For one thing, that is what "in agreement"means. It's also what the explicit analogy with the Supreme Court litmus testimplies. (Otherwise Gore would have said, "You don't need a litmus test,because they have to obey the policy whatever their personal views are." Or hecould have used the word "obey" or "support" instead of "be in agreementwith.")            This interpretation is reinforced by the reality of the gays-in-the-militarydebate: The president can't just order the Chiefs to change the"don't-ask" policy, since that policy has now been written into law byCongress, and changing it requires congressional action. That's why it would beso important for a president to know that his Joint Chiefs nomineespersonally support his policy (so they'll be on his side in the battlewith Congress) and not just that they will obey him (which wouldn't do thepresident any good).            Bob: Don't you owe someone $10?            * Conflict of interest disclosure: Shrum and his wife, Marylouise Oates,are friends of mine. I've eaten dinner at their house; I've even stayed therewhen in Washington. God, it's all too embarrassing. I think Shrum may have beena good soldier in this instance, attempting to defend an untenable position.But in a very brief phone conversation, he said he'd read the whole transcript,and he seemed sincere in sticking to his interpretation. I admit I haven't beenso understanding of others, such as                JamesCarville               , who haven't fed me so many meals.
