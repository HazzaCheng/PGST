What?                              "Allcan be purchased in Beijing."-- Daniel Radosh ( Greg Diamond andDavid Ballard had a similar answer.)               "Theyare each based on a Jane Austen novel.

Manyof you wallowed in the olfactory, particularly in the odor of corruption andfish. (If News Quiz were played by dogs, what a merry romp that would be!Crazy, hey? I give the Cabinet secretary; you give the scent.) Oscar nomineeWilliam Shakespeare alludes to fish aroma when he says, "Something is rotten inthe state of Denmark." His was another example of the bisexual symbolism offish; it is one of the few things used to represent both male and femalegenitalia. "Stinking fish" was a derogatory Elizabethan reference to vaginalodor; and cod--as in cod piece--was slang for penis. Perhaps the fish is such aflexible metaphor because the general shape of its body is phallic, while itsopen mouth suggests the vagina. So, who's hungry? Anybody up for seafood?                                 Inductive,Funductive Answer                              As Pamela Weishaar knew (click for more PamelaWeishaar), "We're No. 2!"               Mattel, the nation's No. 1 toy company will becomeits second largest consumer software producer, behind Microsoft, when itcompletes its purchase of the Learning Company for $3.8 billion.               Al Gore requires no explanation except, perhaps, forhis astonishing physical grace. The man moves like a young panther.               Landry's is No. 2 in what the restaurant industrycalls the "casual seafood" category. Last week, Landry's agreed to buyConsolidated Restaurants for $84 million in stock and $80 million in assumeddebt, giving Landry's control over The Spaghetti Warehouse. For my money,nothing says good eating like "warehouse."                                 Cruel Intentionswas No. 2 at the box office this past weekend in what the movie industry callsthe "dim-witted teen remake" category. ( Analyze This was No. 1.)
