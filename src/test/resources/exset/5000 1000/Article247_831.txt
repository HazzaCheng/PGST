                                 Mills for Their Grist            Defense, of two different kinds, dominates today. The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes go with Wednesday's effort before the Senate by PresidentClinton's defense team. And the New York Timesand USAToday go with the U.S.' renewed interest in erecting a missile defensesystem.            The papers report that the Clinton lawyers yesterday waged an aggressiveattack on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges lodged against theirclient. The day's arguments are widely seen as a continuation of the Clintonteam's willingness to not only question whether the prosecution's facts mandateimpeachment but also to question the facts themselves. But for the most partthe coverage makes it clear that the weapon of the day was nonetheless not thescalpel but the broad brush.            The papers' consensus star of the day, Clinton attorney Cheryl Mills (thepapers want whenever possible to have heroes and villains and they love newfaces), responded to the House prosecutors' charge that Clinton had violatedPaula Jones' civil rights with what the LAT calls a "spirited defense"of Clinton's civil rights record, referring along the way to Bill Clinton'sshopkeeper grandfather's penchant for selling to blacks when few whites would.Mills also put her client firmly in the civil rights pantheon of AbrahamLincoln, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The WP plays Mills'civil rights salute high, while the NYT puts it atthe very bottom of its account. The LAT also plays it high, but thenlate in its story flatly states that in making this response "Mills strayedconsiderably from the facts of the case." And the Post dings Mills forsaying that the Jones case was thrown out without mentioning that the presidentpaid $850,000 to make it go away.            All the papers report that Pat Robertson said Clinton's State of the Unionspeech was a "home run," mooting his impeachment. And they all quote Clintonattorney Gregory Craig's claim that "if you convict and remove PresidentClinton, then no president of the United States will ever be safe fromimpeachment hearings." But none of them wonder, Why would we want that?Obviously, impeachment was designed as a sanction that would regulatepresidential conduct, a feature utterly lost if it were to become a deadletter.            The USAT lead flatly states that the Pentagon plans to construct aprimarily ground-based anti-missiledefense system by 2005 and that the next federal budget, due out on Feb. 1,will plan for $10.5 billion spread out over six years for just that purpose.The paper goes on to point out that most of the hardware that would go intosuch a system has never been tested. The NYT says that although thePentagon is sure the new system will be developed, President Clinton has notgiven final approval. And the Times emphasizes not the hardware but thelegal constraints, noting that Clinton last week wrote to Boris Yeltsinbroaching the topic of renegotiating the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the U.S.and Russia have signed so as to allow the development of the system. Bothstories emphasize that the renewed interest in missile defense has beenprompted by the rather sudden development of long-range missiles by roguestates, such as North Korea. The WP also fronts the story.            Another Rashomon effect is on display in the papers' treatment of AlanGreenspan's congressional testimony yesterday about the just-announced Clintonproposal to allow some Social Security funds to be invested in the stockmarket. The WP calls him "wary" and the NYT says he sees a"possible threat." Meanwhile, USAT says he "opposes" it and theLAT says he "assails" it.            The Wall Street Journal front-page news box and the LATfront report that a California jury has ordered the insurance company Aetna topay $116 million in punitive damages for refusing to cover an experimentaltreatment for a patient who later died. The papers say the award is anothersign that the public feels health care companies are too bottom-lineoriented.            Inside USAT is a great example of a piece that gets beyond theoft-repeated facts. It's a commonplace now that the Brady Bill has keptthousands of guns out of the hands of felons. But it turns out, reports thepaper, none of the more than 13,000 people (mostly convicted felons)stopped so far from buying guns by the FBI's recently instituted instantbackground check has been arrested, even though trying to buy a gun by lyingabout one's background is a federal crime.            Back to Cheryl Mills for a minute: None of the papers note that two of thecivil rights heroes she compared Clinton to were also secret philanderers.
