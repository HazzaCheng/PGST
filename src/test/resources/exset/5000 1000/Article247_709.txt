                                 Yesterday's Papers            The New York Times leads with President Clinton's push for anew International Monetary Fund strategy to avert further global economicturmoil. The Washington Post 's lead forecasts that during Monday's HouseJudiciary Committee proceedings, more grounds for the impeachment of PresidentClinton will be added to the 11 counts currently pending. The Los AngelesTimes leads with the story that preoccupies everyone's front: thelatest act in the Lewinsky circus, namely the 4610 pages of evidence releasedyesterday by the House Judiciary Committee.            The new three-volume set of documents includes excerpts from Linda Tripp'staped conversations with Monica Lewinsky and grand jury testimony from VernonJordan, Bettie Currie, Bruce Lindsey, and other key figures. With so many freshdetails, it is hardly surprising that each paper emphasizes a different aspect.All papers note, however, that the new evidence does more to disclose thedetails we've all been wondering about than to substantively change theinvestigation.            The papers also agree that the tapes portray Tripp as a manipulator, whichplays into White House hands. (From the NYT analysis: The "friendship"between Lewinsky and Tripp seems "less a real friendship than a temporaryalliance between two women obsessed with Bill Clinton who often do not evenseem to like each other very much.") The LAT highlights the improbableassertions by Betty Currie, President Clinton's secretary, that despite hidingin the Oval Office bathroom during one of the Clinton-Lewinsky encounters(according to a synopsis of Tripp's account), she remained uncertain about thenature of the encounters: "I had a feeling, but I had nothing to base it onother than a gut." The WP fronts a story about strenuous efforts byJordan and Lindsey to persuade Clinton to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit afterLewinsky testified. As all papers note, Jordan strongly denied that hisjob-search on Lewinsky's behalf was an attempt to get her to lie in the Jonescase.            Citing "an informed source" throughout, the WP lead says thatRepublican investigator David Schippers' new impeachment counts againstPresident Clinton will involve accusations of witness tampering, obstruction ofjustice, and making false statements under oath (as distinguished from moreserious and difficult-to-prove perjury charges). Of the 11 counts already setforth, one which relates to executive privilege will be dropped, becauseSchippers views privilege as the domain of the judicial not the legislativebranch. Schippers' presentation will be countered Monday by Democraticinvestigator Abbe Lowell, who will downplay the gravity of Clinton'soffense.            The NYT lead story, also the off-lead at the WP , describesClinton's proposal that the IMF distribute preemptive emergency lines of creditto countries that show relative economic stability but nonetheless couldsuccumb to panic swings. (The NYT observes that Clinton's "hastypresentation . . . suggested the idea had been cobbled togetherquickly"--perhaps to deflect attention from Starr's new releases.) Clinton'swords came on the same day as the release of a Labor Department report showingthat fewer jobs were created and unemployment rose incrementally duringSeptember--developments which raise some fears that the Asian malaise isspreading to the U.S. Clinton's IMF proposal contains a number of weaknesses,as the papers point out. First, these "lines of credit" are as-yet vaguelydefined and may not differ significantly from current IMF policy. Second andmore crucially, the IMF needs to collect its money before it can activate sucha plan. The U.S. (among other debtor nations) still owes the IMF $18 billion.Approval for the payment is mired in the House, where Republicans are staunchlyopposed to additional IMF funding.            And now for some comic relief: The NYT Arts section reports thatFrench literary great Marcel Proust has just joined company with Asterix andTintin. His 12-volume classic Remembrance of Things Past has been remadeinto a French comic book, which has been selling like mad(eleines). All 12,000first-run copies were scooped up in three weeks. This naturally has sparked aheated debate in France, where attempts to "democratize Proust" affront Frenchcustodianship of high culture.            Anyone sending mail to Russia is out of luck. The NYT front pagereports that almost all of the country's mail service has shut down becauserailway companies and some airports are demanding $13 million in back pay fromthe post office. Predictably, the post office is owed approximately that sameamount by the government. Hey, Russia, it's email time!
