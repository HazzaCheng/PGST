Inquiring minds in the "Clinton and the Media" threadfocused this week on the question of key Whitewater witness David Hale'spossibly tainted testimony. The possibility that outside forces (notablybillionaire Clinton-hater Richard Mellon Scaife) might have tampered withStarr's star witness stoked the debate. Starr's conservative defenders,naturally, chafed at the notion that they might be sidetracked in their doggedpursuit of the president. His liberal critics, on the other hand, over Starr'sno-win dilemma: He must investigate his own chief witness--a course that wouldinvite all kinds of political fusillades--or turn the process over to JanetReno's internal investigators. Oh, and that gal back in Arkansas--Paula Jones?Her planned appeal raised scarcely a blip.            A by anunassuming fraygrant caused the venerable "Language" thread to erupt into itsmost intense debate ever. The topic: Does language influence culture? By week'send, the lines had been drawn, with two opposing camps staking out their turfand even coming up with labels for their positions. The Bi-Directionalistsbelieve that language influences culture even as culture influences language;the other side avers it doesn't. The debate should segue nicely into nextmonth's discussion of Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct in the"Reading" thread.                           NewThreads                        "Black in America" eruptedwhen an African-American fraygrant asked which white fraygrant would be thefirst to apologize to him for slavery. Affirmative action was debated, as wasthe question of privatizing schools: Would it collapse America's classdivisions or just lead to even more problems? But the biggest firestorm eruptedover test scores: How are they used? Are they obsolete? Do test-resultdisparities reflect just cultural-knowledge disparities?            After aslow start, the "Higher Education" thread got a shot in the arm when onefraygrant posed a . A lengthy debate ensued on vocational education programs inhigh schools: Are high schools the best place for them? Should some programs bemoved to the post-secondary level? Should the whole lot be moved? Another topicemerged: the issue of exit exams in higher education. Which states use them,and in what fields are students tested? The focus has now shifted to TheBell Curve and its discussion of the needs of gifted students.                           FrayFeud                        In the"Religion" thread, one irreverent poster asked, "Is Gandhi burning in hell?"Another on why Gandhi never became a Christian despite having been possibly thebest Christian of the century. This question tapped an ongoing battle betweenstaunch conservative Christians and liberal-minded believers on topics rangingfrom PBS's Frontline special "From Jesus to Christ" to the interplay ofpolitics, Christians, and gays. Not much common ground here; the battlecontinues.                           A Feastfor the Eyes                        The "Arts" thread was allabout the legendary art critic Clement Greenberg. The debate was inspired byAdam Gopnik's recent New                Yorker review of Florence Rubenfeld'snew biography, Clement Greenberg: A Life , and the Charlie Finch reviewin ArtNet magazine. Did Greenberg really have a great eye, or wasJackson Pollock just a lucky loser foisted on a gullible public by a bull in achina shop?                                             Slate               's"MoviesToday" dialogue between David Denby and Alex Ross has inspired someinteresting posts in the "Movies and Television" thread. To illustrate theirviews, fraygrants posted lists of their favorite films in different genres,from the familiar to the obscure. This led to some on just what belongs on alist of favorite films.
