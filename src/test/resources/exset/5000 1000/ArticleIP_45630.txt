                                 Gore's Internet Problem            AlGore has an Internet problem. No, it's not that silly remark about him havinginvented it. Gore's real problem is that Net surfers apparently think his siteis too dull to visit.            Arecent study by Direct Hit, the Massachusetts-based company that operates a"popularity" search engine, revealed that for five days in late October, almostno one searching the Web for information about Gore actually made their way toGore's official Web site. By a large margin, Web surfers preferred going to aGore parody site or an anti-Gore site to the real thing.            DirectHit tracked the paths of about 1,400 Web surfers who entered the names Al Goreor Bill Bradley into search engines from Oct. 22 to Oct. 27. These were thedays leading up to the "town hall" meeting between Gore and Bradley in NewHampshire. Direct Hit has partnerships with a large number of Web companies,including Microsoft Network, Lycos, InfoSpace, LookSmart, and others. Thecompany claims that it tracks some 71 percent of all Web users over the courseof a month.            Thegood news for Gore is that more Web surfers were looking for his name thanBradley's, by a factor of 57 percent (793 surfers) to 43 percent (597).            Thebad news is that when the search results came up, there was no indication thatanyone during those five days used the results to visit Gore's authorized site .            Theofficial site "didn't even make the top 50" choices of those who searched forGore's name, according to a Direct Hit executive. Instead, Web surferspresented with a variety of options were more likely to visit a joke or parodysite. Gore's site in Spanish was among the 30 sites most often visited by thosesearching for his name, but Direct Hit executives say that after the top 10,there's no significant traffic worth measuring.            Bycontrast, Bradley's official site was the most common destination of those whoentered Bradley's name into a search engine, according to Direct Hit. TheBradley campaign declined to comment on the study.            RogerSalazar, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, says that he has not seen theDirect Hit study. "It doesn't really surprise me," Salazar says. "The vicepresident is much better known than his opponent, and so it makes sense thatmore people would be looking for first-time information that way." Salazar sayshis campaign is focused on making Gore's site "as comprehensive and informativeas it can be" and estimates that the site attracts several thousand uniquevisitors per week.            DirectHit says that while it cannot detect the identity of individual Web users, itcan track their movements with unprecedented precision. "We process the datafrom our partners on a daily basis," says Gary Culliss, Direct Hit's chairmanand co-founder. The process is similar to that used to track banner advertisingon the Web. Culliss added that the popularity rankings also take intoconsideration the amount of time that visitors spend on a given site.            Someof the Gore-related sites that Direct Hit said were visited most by thosesearching for Gore material are out of date and thinly visited. Thethird-most-visited Gore site, according to Direct Hit, is an Al Gore jokerepository, posted on the home page of a GeoCities member and sponsored by theRipon College Republicans. The site is actually no longer at the address thatDirect Hit found to be most visited (a common problem with search engines). Nowon a Tripod home page, the site itself claims to have been hit only 1,110 timessince December 1998. (Nothing currently on the site is going to hurt Gore verymuch. Sample joke: "Topping the list of top 20 shortest books of thecentury-- Al Gore: The Wild Years .")            Ofcourse, the Direct Hit study doesn't mean that no one is going to the Goresite. Loyal visitors probably already know the URL or have it bookmarked intheir Web browsers. And it's possible (though statistically unlikely) thatlarge numbers of Web surfers using search engines not measured by Direct Hitwere flocking to the Gore site. Most important, with the first primaries stillmonths away, the Gore campaign hasn't advertised much to bring newcomers to thesite.            It's also possible thatthe problem is not Gore's alone, but rather is common to front-runners.Although Direct Hit has yet to produce a similar traffic study for theRepublican candidates, a search on its Web site shows that George W. Bush'sofficial siteis also not among the top 10 sites surfed by those entering Bush's name.However, upstart John McCain's official site , like Bradley's, is the most populardestination for those who've entered his name into a search engine.
