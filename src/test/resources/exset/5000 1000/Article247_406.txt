                                 Mine Kampf            The top national story at the Washington Post is the crash of a stealth fighter at anairshow (the first Redskins game at the new stadium dominates the front page),and that accident and two others involving military aircraft are the lead atUSAToday . At the New YorkTimes the lead is the U.S.'s possible shift to endorsing a land mineban, while at the Los Angeles Times , it's a new study about the impact ofimmigration on the California economy and what to do about it--on a front pagedominated by a backstage picture and the accompanying headline "'3rd Rock,''Seinfeld' Stars Win Emmys."            The immigration study, prepared by the Rand Corp. warns that theincreasingly skill-based California economy cannot continue to absorb largeflows of poorly educated immigrants and calls on Congress to: reduce new legalimmigrant admissions to "a moderate range," allow the rate of immigration tofluctuate with general economic conditions, and add education levels andEnglish proficiency as admission criteria. One immigrant advocate is quoted inthe paper denouncing the study as "think tank poppycock."            The NYT land mine story reveals a major policy change: the Clintonadministration told allies over the weekend that it could sign a land mine banprovided the U.S. was allowed nine more years before removing them from theKorean peninsula. Administration sources admitted that the death of PrincessDiana, who had embraced the ban, raised the pressure on the U.S. to make amove. Some hurdles remain however, says the Times : the U.S. would likeat least a limited exemption for anti-personnel mines used in conjunction withanti-tank mines, and also wants an escape clause allowing exemptions forcountries who are the victims of aggression.            The Wall Street Journal reports that Seagram has escalated itscampaign to advertise hard liquor on television by preparing ads including acaveat about responsible drinking. But the Journal reports that three ofthe four major networks said that this latest move will have no impact on theirexisting policies prohibiting liquor ads. (ABC didn't return the reporter'scall.)                           USAT has a big photo-essay inside called "Battle of the Sexes InvadesBoot Camp," in which the paper takes a comparative look at two South Carolinabasic training installations--an Army base where recruits of both sexes traintogether and a Marine one where they are sexually segregated. The reporter evenfound a female Marine who had previously gone through the basic training at theArmy base--she prefers the Marine way of handling the sexes in training. Thepiece says that "the future of gender-integrated training in the military is onthe ropes."            Following a revelation first made in yesterday's Washington Times ,both USAT and the WP run pieces about Paula Jones' tax audit. Thetwo headlines chosen emphasize opposite sides of the dispute. The Post 'sreads: "IRS Audit of Paula Jones Is `Harassment,' Adviser Says" andUSAT 's is: "Clinton Lawyer: No Link To IRS Audit Of Jones."            The top of the NYT front features a sprawling piece about how privateinvestigators are using online resources to dig ever deeper into privateinformation. The piece explains that certain Web sites specialize in sellingsuch personal data as unlisted telephone numbers, bank account numbers, beepernumbers, and even annual salary and investment portfolio information, but ineffect serves as wonderful free advertising for them by mentioning their namesand quoting their rates for these particular services.            There's an odd lacuna in the piece, where it describes the formidablestaffing of "one of the best-connected Washington investigative agencies,"Investigative Group International. It identifies the company's chairman by nameand says also that Ray Kelly, the former NYC chief of police, used to run thefirm's New York operations, but does not elaborate on the following fascinatingtidbit: "The promotion brochure features veteran investigative reporters whonow work for IGI."
