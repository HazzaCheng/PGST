"The euro is born. Long livethe euro!" declared LeMonde Tuesday, celebrating the birth in Brussels over the weekend of thesingle European currency. The Paris newspaper led its front page with theheadline "Euro: outrage in Germany," referring to the "violentattacks" in the German press against the compromise agreed between Germany andFrance over the presidency of the new European Central Bank, which will managethe euro. Dutch central banker Wim Duisenberg, the candidate supported by allEuropean Union members except France, will "voluntarily" serve only half of hisstatutory eight year term and will then be replaced by the governor of the Bankof France, Jean-Claude Trichet.            Thiscompromise, held by many critics to be in contravention of the terms in theMaastricht Treaty for establishing the single currency, was described in theFrankfurter AllgemeineZeitung as "a shadow over monetary union" and in the German businessnewspaper Handelsblatt as horse-trading that would encourage theEuroskeptics in Germany. The popular Bild Zeitung called the birth of the euro in these circumstances"a forceps delivery."            But like the German newspaper Die Welt, which titled its editorial "An Historic Day,"Le Monde said the compromise shouldn't overshadow history. "Never mindthat it has humiliated the man without whom the euro wouldn't have seen thelight of day, Chancellor Helmut Kohl." "Never mind that it has shaken one ofthe last great European leaders ... that it has given arguments to his socialdemocrat opponents only a few months from the September elections. ... That'severyday Europe. The most important, the essential, the historic thing is thecreation of the euro."            TheItalian press was seized with euro excitement. La Repubblica of Rome ledTuesday with news of a stock-exchange boom across Europe, under the headline"Euphoria in the markets," and reported from London that the new currency hadalready been given a market value of $1.124. It also carried an article fromBrussels predicting--despite U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's statementsto the contrary--that the euro would threaten the primacy of "the king dollar."Reporting lack of enthusiasm from the Vatican, La Repubblica said churchofficials feared it would necessitate modifications to the concordat governingrelations between Italy and the Holy See. Italy's leading newspaper, Corriere dellaSera of Milan, pointed out in a front-page comment that Rome was the onlycity in Europe to organize a municipal party to celebrate the birth of theeuro.            In Britain, which has excluded itself from thesingle European currency for the time being, the main headlines Tuesday wereabout the unsuccessful Middle East peace talks in London, though the liberalGuardian's maineditorial was an attack on France for its insistence that aFrenchman should run the new European Central Bank. "No one comes out of itwell, least of all Jacques Chirac, President of France who, like a bullyboy inthe playground, picked up the ball and refused to play on until everyone agreedto his terms," it said.            The conservative DailyTelegraph saidin an editorial that the pressure was not on Benjamin Netanyahuto reach an accommodation but on Yasser Arafat to convince Netanyahu that "hewould be a dependable neighbour" and guarantee Israel's safety. As the talksmove to Washington next week, the Telegraph said only the United Stateswas in a position to mediate a final deal. "[I]ts subsidies throughout theregion give it a clout that Europe lacks and, unlike the EU, it is regarded astough on terrorism, the issue on which the process will ultimately stand orfall," the editorial concluded.
