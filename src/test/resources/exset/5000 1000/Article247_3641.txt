                                 Thus Spake Groucho and Gertrude                        Do you remember the first time you ever heard the expression, "There's nothere there"? I do. I practically remember where I was sitting when I firstread it. Of course, it's Gertrude Stein, speaking of the place she grew up,which I'm pretty sure was Oakland, Cal. This is the sort of thing I could checkif I weren't in Los Angeles. So, forgive me if it's Berkeley. Anyway, what agreat line. What a great great line! I mean, when I first came across it, Ijust stopped reading for a few minutes and rolled that line around in my brainand thought, I would kill to say something that amazing. There's no therethere. No there there. It's right up there with "Everyone will be famous for 15minutes," which is definitely another of the other top 10 lines of the last l00years.            Anyway, you are right about Bush and Clinton and just about everyone: nothere there. Bush I find dangerous precisely because he will win according tomy criteria (and yours), and he knows absolutely nothing. Also, call me crazy,but I hate Republicans. Could never vote for one. Just couldn't. It's as closeas I get to being a practicing Jew. I mean, God would strike me dead if I votedRepublican. If I believed in God. And those horrible Supreme Court justicesRepublicans nominate really matter. (Although it's surprising and fascinatingto see what's happened to Sandra Day O'Connor and--of all people--David Souteras they've carved out a middle-of-the-road pragmatism no one could ever havepredicted.)            One of the things I always find interesting about L.A., where I grew upwaiting desperately for the moment I could get out, is how it found its "there"(kind of the way Miami did). Fred Allen: "Los Angeles is great if you're anorange." Another of the top 10, don't you think?            And Groucho Marx: "I wouldn't join any club that would have me as a member."(Probably not quite accurately quoted, but as I say, there's noBartlett's in my hotel room.)            I've been told that all sorts of people have "worked with" Bradley. I thinkSydney Pollack tried to help, although I could be wrong. Bradley's TV-Q hasdefinitely improved: He was great on Meet the Press a few weeks ago,as relaxed as he'd been the day I saw him in person. But I've also been toldthat people have worked with Al Gore, and it seems to be truly useless. I mean,if you just tied the man's hands together and lashed them down, it would be animprovement. If I were trying to help him, I would tell him to never ever readfrom a speech--that just makes the performance even more deadly. He shouldalways work from index cards with no more than a word or two written on them.Well, so should anyone who gives a speech. I wanted to die when Gore got upafter the Littleton shootings and stood there holding a sheet of paper with aspeech on it that he dutifully read from. On the other hand, if Gore runsagainst Bush and Ventura, we will both be voting for him, I guarantee it.            More children shot with guns last night. Another thing I like about Bradleyis his position on guns. In the L.A. Times today there's an articlethat says that the LAPD has asked Charlton Heston to be its guest speaker at afund-raiser next week. This is the LAPD whose chief is anti-NRA, and this isthe Charlton Heston who refuses to take a position against cop-killer bullets.The man who booked Heston for the speech has this to say: "I was unaware untilafter he accepted that he was the head of the NRA."            Well, I am off to work. And so this is the end of our days together. I feelrelieved, because frankly my entire life has ground to a halt for the last fourdays while I feverishly tried to think of things to say. But I also feel sad.Next week, there's American Beauty to talk about, and while I'm surewe'll both see it over the weekend, and maybe we'll even e-mail each otherabout it now that we know each other's addresses, no one will belistening .            xoxoxox
