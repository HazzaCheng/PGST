Randy'sWrap-Up                                       By rights, this story should have taken place inJapan, the most cuteness-loving country on earth and, coincidentally, the mostpornography-laden nation on the planet and hence a popular destination forvacationing animated space monsters. With perky breasts. And huge, adorableeyes. Whose crazy adventures are recounted in comic books available in vendingmachines on the platforms of every Tokyo train station. So what are we to makeof this Hello Kitty-porn juxtaposition?            Betty Boop. That was theAmerican manifestation of a big-eyed, baby-talking erotic ideal, a sexualfashion that's come and gone. (It is gone, right? Poppin' Fresh--he's a wholeother thing, right?) Perhaps in Japan the cute and the concupiscent do notcoincide but coexist as two distinct phenomena. Like here in the United Stateswith sex and the pizza. Still separate, right? Could I have that withpepperoni?                           TelechubbiesAnswer                        Bubbly Chubbies must be destroyed because they're aknock-off of Teletubbies.            The suspiciously cuddly and maybe just a little tooadorable dolls, on sale in Wal-Mart's 2,435 stores, threaten the$800-million-a-year business generated by the originals. Even the name waschosen "deliberately to rhyme with Teletubbies," charged lawyers for the ItsyBitsy Entertainment Company, the Teletubbies' owners.            "The company would neverknowingly infringe anyone's copyright," said Wal-Mart spokesman Michael Maher."Can I offer you a drink--a Croaka-Cola, or maybe something stronger, like ashot of Jack Spaniels?" he didn't add.
