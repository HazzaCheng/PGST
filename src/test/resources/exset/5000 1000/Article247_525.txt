                                 Goodbye, Columbus?            The Washington Post and New York Timeslead with the Clinton administration's post-Columbus moves to shore up publicsupport for its Iraq stance, with the Post reporting that critics of aU.S. air assault now include Jimmy Carter. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the brewing dispute between Kenneth Starr and seniorClinton aides he is questioning over whether or not they are relieved fromanswering by executive privilege. USA Todayleads with the arrest of two men, one of them a neo-Nazi, for possession ofsuspected anthrax for use as a weapon. Allegedly, the men were plotting todeploy the agent in the New York City subway system--yeah right, like anthraxcould survive that. The anthrax story also makes the NYT and LATfronts, but is pushed inside at the WP .            The WP reports that President Clinton warned Saddam Hussein not to mistake theskeptical questions raised at the raucous Columbus forum as a sign thatAmericans lack resolve for military action. This comment came, says thePost , as a new poll shows 63 percent of respondents support bombing Iraqif it doesn't stop interfering with weapons inspectors. The poll's fine pointsare a little more confusing, however. 56 percent of the respondents say theU.S. should try to force Saddam from power, but 56 percent also say they opposea U.S. invasion with ground troops. This sort of free-lunch result is anAmerican polling staple--it's just like all those polls that show folks want abalanced budget, but not higher taxes or reduced Social Security or Medicarebenefits.            The NYT 's coverage of the hearts and mind stage of theIraq run-up suggests more of an uphill battle than does the WP 's: "A dayafter U.S. policy toward Iraq was passionately picked apart at a town hallmeeting in Ohio, President Clinton tried to reassemble the pieces.."            The NYT reports this comment on the Columbus protests made by Sen.Barbara Mikulski of Maryland to Clinton as he appeared with her at an event onThursday: "You and the first lady weren't exactly angelic a couple of yearsago. I don't think you've done too bad being a protester."            The LAT lead states that presidential confidant Bruce Lindseydeclined to answer some questions during his two-day Starr grand juryappearance, which, the paper says, set the stage for a "Watergate-style battle"over the use of executive privilege.            A NYT editorial weighs in on this dispute, taking theposition that as long as Starr's questions "stick to the pertinent issues," andstay out of say, "military options in Iraq," they should be answered. Ofcourse, what counts as pertinent to Whitewater has already been loosenedconsiderably, and could get looser. If, for instance, there was prima facieevidence that President Clinton had discussed Iraq moves with Lewinsky, then bythe same logic that got us here, Ken Starr would be entitled to question herabout that too.                           USAT reports that Vernon Jordan met four times with Lewinsky, butnever mentions that this was first reported yesterday by the WP .            "Well, O.K., maybe not all our promises." The LAT front andthe WP inside feature stories stating that Promise Keepers is sostrapped financially that it will soon stop paying its 345 salariedemployees.            The Wall Street Journal main "Politics and Policy" piece has atidy break-out of lessons learned by both sides in the Gulf War. According tothe Journal , it's US: Minimize casualties, both civilian and military;stealth technology works; precision-guided munitions work; you need to be ableto deploy quickly; and air power is more effective now than in the past. AndSaddam: Survival is victory; Americans don't like casualties on either side;bring in foreign TV, but not foreign print reporters; portray yourself as thevictim, not the bully, and don't slug it out, but "shoot and scoot." The papersays Pentagon officials suspect the Iraqi secret police may be keeping thebodies of executed political prisoners in cold storage, to be blown up anddistributed wherever American bombs drop.            The WSJ has these Monica tidbits: 1) Vernon Jordan isn't part of thejoint defense agreement entered into by many other grand-jury witnesses withWhite House ties. 2) The House Judiciary Committee is making plans to hire 18"new" lawyers for a possible impeachment inquiry. For the sake of the republic,"Today's Papers" hopes the Journal means "additional."
