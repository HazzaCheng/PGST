                                 Courting and Mating            The surprise congressional resurgence of campaign reform leads at theWashington Post , New York Times ,and LosAngeles Times . USA Today leads with the FDA's warning about creatine, amuscle-building supplement widely used by athletes.            The dailies explain that House GOP leaders agreed to allow campaign financelegislation to come to floor votes next month because reform advocates wereclose to getting enough signatures on a special petition to force a voteanyway. President Clinton is quoted saying the development was "great news,"but House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt is quoted saying, "This was a retreatnot a conversion. The Republican leadership still opposes reform that reducesthe role of money in politics." And indeed the coverage points out that theSenate has already defeated a ban on "soft money" once this session.            Both the NYT and USAT fronts cover yesterday's oral argumentsin the fourth and final sexual harassment case the Supreme Court ishearing this term. The issue in this one is whether a supervisor's singlethreat saying a female subordinate's sexual compliance will ease her workingconditions constitutes harassment when her non-compliance meets with no adverseconsequences. The issue is an ingredient in the Paula Jones case and hence theCourt's decision here might affect her appeal. Both papers note that many ofthe justices seemed genuinely perplexed during yesterday's arguments.            Meanwhile, the WP front observes firm differences about gender on display in the Court's 6-3decision to uphold the law that automatically grants U.S. citizenship to anout-of-wedlock child if the mother is an American, but not if only the fatheris. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,presumed that there is a closer connection between a mother and her child thanbetween a father and his. But Justice Ruth Ginsburg dissented, taking a pureapproach to sexual equality. The Post 's Joan Biskupic, notes thatgenerational differences seem to be at play in this decision, with the olderjustices siding with the maternalistic bias.            No wonder the Administration's announcement the other day that needleexchange programs do work but won't be getting federal funds seemed so lame:according to a front-page story at the WP , until a half-hour beforethe press conference, HHS Secretary Donna Shalala was all set to announcefederal funding. That was when White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles toldher that President Clinton had decided the exchange position was toopolitically risky.            The WP runs an AP report stating that the first national survey ofphysician-assisted suicide found that 6 percent of the front-line doctorsresponding have hastened patients' deaths with lethal injections orprescriptions. The Post story goes on to say that one-third of thesurveyed doctors would write prescriptions for deadly dosages. USAT saysthat 11 percent of doctors would do so. The NYT , in the headline overits survey story, says the finding is that physician-assisted suicide is"rare." Meanwhile, the LAT reports on its front that Linda McCartney didnot die in Santa Barbara as the family first reported. The family admits nowthat this was a diversion which, says the paper, has in turn spurred some talkthat perhaps her death was an assisted suicide.            The WP front reports that NATO planning last summer to captureBosnian Serb leader and wanted war criminal Radovan Karadzic was compromisedwhen a French military officer met secretly with Karadzic. The NYT runsthe story inside, crediting the Post .            According to the WSJ, the IRS estimates that in 1996 taxpayers who itemizedgave $84.3 billion to charity, up 12.4% from 1995. Concomitantly, manycharities are having banner years. For instance, the Journal notesBaylor Healthcare System Foundation has raised $23 million through March,surpassing the $17 million it raised in all of last year.            The NYT front reports on a new web page for kids set up by the CIA(www.odci.gov/cia/ciakids). The site is laced with trivia quizzes on worldgeography and history. And it explains the agency's purpose: "Intelligence isinformation needed by our nation's leaders, also known as policy makers, tokeep our country safe. Policy makers, like the president, do not have time toread all the other countries' newspapers. There are just too many of them.""Today's Papers" has never felt more patriotic.
