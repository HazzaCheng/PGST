                                 The (Young) People's Car                           Sabotage , producedby J.J. Sedelmaier Productions Inc. for Volkswagen of America Inc.                           Sabotage resurrects aJapanese import from the '70s--the Speed Racer cartoon series--to sell a'90s German import, the Volkswagen GTI. Produced and directed by the legendaryJ.J. Sedelmaier, the ad exploits the nascent nostalgia of twentysomethings andthirtysomethings who watched the Speed Racer series in syndicationduring their younger days, or saw it during the '90s on MTV and the CartoonNetwork.            The spot plucks thenostalgia chord in the first frames, opening like an episode of the cartoonseries, with the Sabotage title splashed across the rotating wheel ofSpeed's car, the Mach-5. The Japanese characters at the bottom of the titlecard credit Sedelmaier and his team, who have expertly mimicked theJapanimation style of the original series. To make it look more authentic,Sedelmaier corrupted the new animation by transferring the negative to a secondone to make the cartoon look 25 years old. This emphasis on authenticityactuates Marshall McLuhan's notion of medium as message: The cartoon is thereal thing, and so is the car.            In the first scene, the hoodis up and smoke is pouring out. The Mach-5 has been sabotaged. The Mach-5 isbig, powerful, and gas-guzzling. What Speed needs something moreefficient--smaller, but with big pickup and quick response.            Speed's obviously rattledmechanic-friend, Pops, expresses panic--"Speed, if you don't win, we could loseeverything." As in the series, the words are slightly out-of-sync--as if dubbedfrom the Japanese. Just in time, Inspector Detektor reveals the solution toSpeed's problem--keys with a VW logo--and presents him with the car. Speedknows what it is--"The Volkswagen GTI!"            We cut/dissolve to ayellow-and-red checkered race flag and into the race. As the GTI gains on thepack, Trixie, sitting in the passenger seat, urges her pilot on: "Faster,Speed!"            With competitors bumpingeach other, Pops issues his warning from the back seat ("Look out!"),previewing the coming assurance that while the GTI can race along, it still hasroom for four. It's instantly maneuverable, too. Speed slips through the seamas a rival's car plunges into a fiery crash. Another note of authenticity: Theexplosive sound effects come from the show's old episodes.            Meanwhile, back inside thecar, Speed avoids another fiery collision to cross the finish line under theblack-and-white checkered flag. "It's amazing," Speed says. "It's got room forfour," chimes in Pop from the back seat. Then Chim Chim the monkey and Speed'skid brother Spridle pop up from the hatchback luggage space. "Make that six,"says Spridle, a perennial stowaway in Speed Racer episodes.            The green-and-yellow flagthat fills the screen signals danger past, victory won; Speed survives to raceanother day. As he jumps from the GTI in the cartoon's patented style, Speeddelivers the VW slogan in voice-over, shifting from nostalgia to the now: "Onthe road of life, there are passengers and there are drivers." Thetwentysomethings and thirtysomethings spent their time as passengers; theirparents were driving while they were watching Speed Racer . Now,Sedelmaier's spot brilliantly suggests, it's their time to do the driving--incars and in life. Time to race ahead in the vehicle that saved ourhero--unless, of course, they'd rather just hold back, stay at home, and becomecouch potatoes staring at reruns of Speed and Trixie.                           SpeedRacer's musical theme--"Go Speed Racer, go!"--finishes the spot as the VWend card comes up: "Drivers wanted." Sedelmaier has rescued Japanimation from agenerational memory hole to sell a German car to young consumers who mayconsider it the opposite of cool. One relic redeems another: Drivers wanted forthe gee-whiz GTI--and it may just get them.            --RobertShrum
