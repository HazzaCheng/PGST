                                 Brow Beating            Dear Culturebox--            In response to your "whole indie scene" point: To me this is the problem,not the solution. There was once in this country--let's say the 60's forshorthand--a thriving Highish Midbrow Culture.            This is a culture where Roth and Updike made the bestseller list; where BobDylan's "Blonde on Blonde" charted; where Francis Ford Coppola made a studiomovie called The Godfather ; and where Michael Herr published his VietnamWar Dispatches in Esquire . I think this culture mattered--notjust to the artists who created these works, but to the lived texture of lifein middle-class America. I think this culture mattered to as many middle-classAmericans as it did because these works were produced and dispensed andpromoted by mainstream businesses, who knew how to reach them. I think thesemainstream businesses produced, dispensed and promoted these products notbecause there were hard numbers because some individual in some office at theseplaces believed in the artists and their products.            Now we have a vapid Blockbuster Culture and a fringy Indie Culture and afragile Highish Midbrow Culture that ever more depends, like the High Cultureworld of museums and opera houses long has, on the largesse of angels--think ofSi Newhouse...or, closer to home, Bill Gates. Hold your Bookscan, please. I'lltake the rumpled editor who takes a bet on a Lorrie Moore and sticks with heruntil the breakout book--and maybe buys the time by signing up a decentcookbook.                           ---Gerry Marzorati                                       Dear Gerry--                        I don't know. I think you're letting nostalgia cloud your vision. Then asnow, there was infinitely more cheese-topping on the great cultural pizza thanthere was pepperoni, even if you lower the brow-level on the pepperoni. Whatabout that hit sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies ? ( Beverly Hills 90210is merely a few blocks over and up from that.) Or that musical wonder HerbAlpert and the Tijuana Brass, the pseudo-mariachi band that graced its albumswith photos of beautiful brown-skinned women covered with whipped cream? We'retalking cornball kitsch that couldn't even get an audience at a hip coffee bartoday. For books, bestselling titles like The Greening of Americaand Coffee, Tea, or Me float to mind.                        Conversely, I don't think the current music scene is half as bad as you makeit out to be. Last time I logged onto the Billboard Top 200site, Lauryn Hill's new CD was #2. You can't tell me her serious fusion ofhip hop and rap--or, say, the razzle-dazzle poetics of the Wu-TangClan--doesn't speak to some people today the way "Blonde on Blonde" did to itsgeneration. Same with Pulp Fiction , the Godfather of its era. Or DonDelillo's Underworld , which I personally couldn't stand but which spoketruth to many and lingered on the bestseller list for weeks. We                couldgo on all day, each jockeying to out-brow the other, high and low, which wouldbe enormously fun for us but boring, I'm afraid, for our readers.                                       On another front, I have to insist that better, clearer, more rigorousnumbers would help books more than they'd hurt them. For instance, if theNew York Times Bestseller List didn't fiddle with the numbers so much--onlylooking at certain bookstores and going so far as to seed the process bysending out a list of books it's interested in tracking, as my colleagueElizaTruitt                reported in                Slate                a little whileago--certain regional bestsellers, such as Cold Mountain , wouldn't takeso long to come to national attention. I know the conventional thinking is thatthe NYT Bestseller List is good for mid-list books, because it refusesto track crap, but if the NYT Bestseller List were based on firm andcomprehensive numbers, rather than guesstimates, why couldn't the Timesstill refuse to track crap? It would just have to be more upfront about howit slices the stats and then it would do much a better job of following theserious books throughout the country, not just at selected stores.                        --Culturebox
