                                 No Czechs Please?            The Washington Post and USA Todaylead with Janet Reno's protestations that her probe of Clinton fund-raising isfar from closed. The New YorkTimes leads with a simmering debate about the costs of NATO expansion.And the Los Angeles Times front, dominated by local stories, givessome play to the new stricter rules for disability aid to children (a storydone in greater depth last week by the Wall Street Journal ).            Today's Reno leads are the product of her Sunday "Meet The Press"counteroffensive in response to Republican charges of being duped by Clinton inthe handling of the coffee tapes. "Nothing has been closed, and nobody has beenexonerated," Reno is quoted as saying in both papers.            The Post juxtaposes its report that as of right now, Reno still feelsthe coffee videos are not indications of Clinton criminality with mention ofthe appearance in the tapes of Arief Wiriadinata, an Indonesian who identifieshimself on camera as an emissary of the Lippo Bank's James Riady, and of fivebusinessmen having coffee with the president in the Oval Office who, it is nowknown, each contributed $100,000 within a week.            The NYT points out that President Clinton's proposed expansion ofNATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic depends on the jointapproval of the Senate and the parliaments of the 15 other members of NATO, andthat cost will be the decisive issue in those votes. Senate conservatives, ledby Jesse Helms, says the Times , don't want to pay too much of the totalexpansion bill, but European politicians, who need to cut their deficits toqualify for the Eurodollar, are not much inclined to pick up the slack.            And apparently, nobody agrees on what the bill is. The current Americanestimate is up to $35 billion through 2009. The Brits think that's 40 percenttoo high. The French, not to be outdone, intend to pay nothing extra. TheCongressional Budget Office says the American estimate is too low.            The WSJ has given some good coverage lately to the upcoming globalwarming meetings and to the political debates they are provoking, and today's"Outlook" column by Alan Murray takes the issue seriously, saying that in thenext century the Earth's average temperature probably will rise by two to sixdegrees. Murray says that the question dominating the White House debatebetween the environmentalists and the economists, the question that PresidentClinton is faced with, is, "How much should the nation sacrifice now to buyinsurance against threats in the future?" Murray says that Clinton and Gore"know that proposing even something as modest as a 25-cent-a-gallon gasolinetax for this purpose wouldn't sell with the American public, which is busybuying gas-guzzling sports vehicles, or with Congress." But is that so obvious?In southern California, where the economy is roaring back, gas prices went upnearly that much this past summer and it was hardly a back-page story, muchless the cause of any political ferment. If the economy is good, people willpay extra for gas, and what the Journal tends to downplay is that almostall the environmental controls implemented thus far have proven to be good forbusiness.            The President arrived in Caracas, Venezuela yesterday, where he made hisinitial pitch for what will be the main theme of his ten-day South Americantrip--the expansion of free trade. The LAT puts this story on its front(although below the fold) and it also is the top item in the WSJ 'sworld-wide news digest. But it's buried by the WP (picture on the front,but story on page 22), and by the NYT (the national edition has apicture on the front, the story inside, while the metro edition dispenses withthe picture). Now, not every country is equally important to America orAmericans, but it's hard to understand, given the increasingly Hispanicdemographic of this country, how it is that the papers could show less interestin this trip than say, Bill Clinton's vacation on Martha's Vineyard.
