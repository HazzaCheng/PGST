                                 Bare Market            The New York Timesand Washington Post lead with the House JudiciaryCommittee's decision to grant President Clinton's lawyers two 9 AM-to-midnightsessions this week to make their case against impeachment. The Los AngelesTimes puts that story on the front but leads with the ever-worseningrelations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on the eve of PresidentClinton's Middle East trip. The big bone of contention is whether or not Israelis abiding by its Wye promise to free Palestinian political prisoners. Anotheris whether President Clinton's visit to Palestinian-ruled Gaza will have thefull trappings of a visit to an independent state. USA Todaygoes with upcoming statistics from the Centers for Disease Control suggestingthat the food-poisoning bacteria E. coli--usually associated with inadequatelycooked hamburgers--may be causing twice as much illness as previously thought.USAT 's off-lead is another scientifically based second look at U.S.life: New computer-assisted studies match up DNA left at violent crime scenessurprisingly often with the DNA of known burglars, indicating that contrary totraditional dogma, burglary is a good predictor of violent crime.            The NYT and WP leads communicate almost exactly the sameinformation: The tart letters back and forth between Judiciary and the WhiteHouse. The likely schedule of events, culminating in the committee vote Fridayor Saturday. Tom DeLay's judgement that the House floor vote will be close, butwill produce an impeachment bill. Both say that until last week the impeachmenttide had ebbed considerably but that Clinton's answers to Judiciary's 81questions made it rise again. Both have Rep. Christopher Shay's quote aboutthose answers: "I mean he still doesn't get it....He still doesn't tell thetruth." Both have Trent Lott saying that if the House votes to impeach, theSenate will put Clinton on trial quickly. The two stories are near twins because they both reflect the standardno-shoe-leather m.o. for many a Monday Washington story: Watch the Sunday chatshows.            The LAT follows yesterday's lead about the FDA ignoring warningsabout a diabetes drug now implicated in 33 deaths with a top-front effort todayrevealing that the man responsible for the federal government's largest studyof diabetes, which included administration of that drug, was at that time alsoon the payroll of the drug's manufacturer, Warner-Lambert, as a consultant. Thepaper says that according to legal experts, this seems to be a crime underfederal conflict-of-interest law.            The "cover story" in USAT 's "Money" section checks in on whathappened when management yoda Steven Covey merged his firm with rival FranklinQuest. According to the paper, there's hardly been one effective habit ondisplay, much less seven. The company's stock is but three dollars above itssix-year-old initial offering price, and sales of its business consultingproducts and services are flat. Meanwhile, there have been time-consumingwrangles between the two partners over such significa as the dress code and thecompany logo. One observer quoted sums up the situation this way: "It's proofthat the great business gurus know how to run everyone's business but theirown."            The WP front features a story about Y2K survivalists. In thefourteenth paragraph, the Post stops to explain something: "the Y standsfor 'year,' and 2K is shorthand for 2000."            Today, some poor soul (two actually) at the Wall Street Journal has to write about Scottish Power'sexpected announcement that it has agreed to acquire PacifiCorp, yadda yadda,but elsewhere in the paper, another reporter lucks out. Today, theJournal 's Asra Q. Nomani is an island of lust in a sea of lucre, filinga long, long, look at the slow, slow-sex industry known as Tantra. There aresome of the usual trappings of a financial story, but most of the multipleshere aren't P/Es. For instance: "Known as 'Shara,' Ms. Seabrook slips off awhite-gauze sarong from over her white G-string bikini as she climbs on amassage table to straddle the table with Ms. Clarke's live-in boyfriend, EvanSarver, 30, a Web designer, who sits naked, his face just inches from hers."Who cares what the market does today?
