                                 The Ships Hit the Fan                           USAToday and the Los Angeles Times lead with a major U.S. vs. Japan dust-upconcerning shipping. The Washington Post leads with yet another use by PresidentClinton of the line-item veto. And the New York Times goes with news that major carinsurers plan to raise rates for sports utility vehicles.            On Thursday, the United States told the Coast Guard to bar Japanese cargoships from U.S. ports and to detain those already here. The action came, sayUSAT and the LAT , after three Japanese cargo ship companiesrefused to pay $4 million in fines levied because of their costly and unfairtreatment of U.S. ships in Japanese ports. Both papers say the developmentinspired yesterday's 119-point drop in the Dow. And USAT calls it themost tense situation between the two countries in ten years. The decision wasmade by a federal maritime commission and could be overturned by Clinton. TheWhite House tells USAT that the two countries are in negotiations.            Yesterday, the WP reports, President Clinton used his newfoundline-item veto to kill a provision that would have allowed many federal workersto switch to a different pension system, boosting their annuities but costingtaxpayers about $854 million over five years. In response, a major federalemployees' union in New York filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionalityof the line-item veto. In a separate action, New York City also filed a similarsuit yesterday against a previous Clinton line-item move. Hence, for the firsttime, there are anti-line-item suits in the courts with plaintiffs allegingactual harm.            About a month ago, the NYT ran a front-page story revealing thatcrash tests show sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are inflicting veryhigh levels of harm to cars and their occupants in collisions, and today theTimes brings word that in response, some big insurance companies areraising their liability rates on the oversize vehicles. The move might be, saysthe paper, the largest overhaul of liability insurance since the advent ofno-fault, meaning perhaps increases of 20 percent for the big vehicles and cutsof 10 percent for car owners.            The Times wonders whether the adjustments will hurt oversize vehiclesales, but goes on to observe that their owners are perhaps too prosperous tobe affected, reporting that the typical Chevrolet Suburban buyer is now moreaffluent than the typical Cadillac buyer, and that the average household buyinga Range Rover or Lexus LX450 makes $360,000 a year.            The NYT , WP , and LAT all run front-page stories about afertility breakthrough: the first successful pregnancy in this country using afrozen egg. Although the egg in this case came from another woman, thisdevelopment sets up the possibility that young women will be able to freezetheir own eggs (which are less biologically problematic) and then much later,when the women are ready to have children, have them fertilized. The techniquewould also allow women undergoing chemotherapy to save some eggs for later use.According to details in the NYT piece, the "donor" of the frozen eggthat produced the twins was paid about $46,000, or almost five times the goingrate for a full-term surrogate pregnancy.            The Wall Street Journal 's "Washington Wire" reports that WhiteHouse aides are very unhappy that U.S. reporters devoted much of a Clinton newsconference with Brazil's president to Clinton's campaign-finance woes.            If you want proof that even at the NYT , the front page isn't alwaysso objective, check out the headline on the Times front page: "ClintonsPresent Their Act to an Admiring Argentina." Who gets sober, respectfulheadlines at the Times if not the president? Well on the same page, overa story about yesterday's speeches and ceremonies at the Times markingthe retirement of NYT CEO Arthur Ochs Sulzberger and the succession tothat title of his son is the headline "Sulzberger Passes Leadership of TimesCo. to Son." Not "Sulzbergers Present Their Act to Admiring Employees."
