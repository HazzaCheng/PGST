                                 Chatterbox Goes Too Far!            One reason Kathleen Willey's tale of groping and fondling in the Oval Officeseems credible is this: if she were making up a story, she could have made up amuch better one. For example, Willey told Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes thatwhen Clinton made his pass, she remembers saying to him, "Aren't you afraidthat somebody's going to walk in here?" Not exactly the strongest or mostplaintive objection she might have lodged. The pass itself could easily havebeen made cruder, and Willey could have alleged it was repeated--if she'd beenin a fabricating, sympathy-generating mode. Thanks to Time magazine, wehave evidence that when Willey wants to make up a story, she knows howto pull out all the emotional stops. Time says that in 1995 when Willeydecided to get back at a former lover, Shaun Docking, she told him she waspregnant. But not just pregnant, pregnant with his twins! Then she told him shewould have an abortion. Then on the morning the abortion was supposed tohappen, she had her then-friend, Julie Steele, tell him she'd called it off.Then she had her friend tell him she'd had a miscarriage! Could any hackscreenwriter have milked that scenario for more drama? Contrast that with thebanality of Willey's Clinton story. So, in a perverse way, Time's taleof Willey's pregnancy lie actually tends to support her veracity when it comesto Clinton. ... Okay, maybe that's going a bit too far. But you get the point...                           Save Clinton First! Some pretty good evidence that Flytrap hasseriously distracted the president: columnist Robert Novak reports that at theGridiron Dinner on March 21, he sat next to Clinton and asked the presidentabout Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's Social Security reform proposal, whichMoynihan had unveiled a week earlier. (See Jodie Allen's analysis.) For any presidentinterested in, say, a second term legacy, Moynihan's plan was a reasonably bigdeal. Social Security's solvency is one of the two or three major domesticissues facing Clinton, and "saving" the system was a central theme of hisrecent State of the Union address. While Moynihan hasn't been a Clintonloyalist and his social policy proposals (e.g. on welfare) don't always fly, hespeaks with some authority as ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.His plan was also considered radical, coming from a Social Security defender,because it suggested using part of Social Security's payroll tax to fund"voluntary personal savings accounts" that would supplement regular SocialSecurity benefits. (Indeed, Moynihan was almost immediately blasted from theleft.). Yet, according to Novak, on March 21 Clinton "did not seem familiarwith Moynihan's latest plan...." Whatever else you want to say about Clinton,he's not usually inattentive or uninterested in domestic policy. The MoynihanPlan is something he would normally be on top of, were he not preoccupied withother matters ...                           True Love: An excellent conspiratorial moment at a recent Washington,D.C., party given for Salon magazine. Present were: presidential aideSidney Blumenthal, newscaster Jim Lehrer, columnist Molly Ivins, journalistChristopher Hitchens, stunt man David Brock, and Murray Waas, the oddballinvestigative reporter who has been chronicling the machinations of the VastRight Wing Conspiracy for Salon and the New York Observer . At onepoint, Waas, looking around the room as if to make sure noone was followinghim, snuck out the rear door into the unlit back yard. A few seconds later,Blumenthal slipped out the same back door to join Waas. They could then be seenhaving a brief, but intense, tete-a-tete in the darkness. ...

Oneold-guard Rover executive complained to journalist Jeremy Clarkson that BMW'squality control policies were "stupid. They just won't tolerate any mistakes atall." ...
