                                 Service Without A Smile            The dramatic court fight over just how secret the Secret Service is supposedto be--going today to the desk of Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquistat the request of the DOJ--leads at USA Today andthe Washington Post . The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times lead instead with Lockheed Martin Corp.'s decision, inthe face of government antitrust objections, to abandon its planned $8.3billion acquisition of the Northrop Grumman Corp.            Rehnquist, who handles emergency matters for the Washington federal courts(and who, the papers note, is coming into town from Innsbruck, Austria, wherehe was teaching a summer course) is getting the case of what to do about subpoenas issued by Kenneth Starrto several members of President Clinton's Secret Service protective detailbecause yesterday a federal appeals court unanimously refused to quash them.Some of the language used by the appeals court judges was quite strident. "Thepresident's agents have literally and figuratively declared war on theindependent counsel," wrote one, quoted all around. The WP calls theappeals court pass a "resounding defeat" for the Clinton administration.            The papers note that top presidential bodyguard Larry Cockell--pictured onthe USAT , WP and NYT top fronts--was so distracted by theevents that he accepted being temporarily relieved of his presidential dutiesuntil the matter is resolved. Cockell's lawyer tells the Post that"being compelled to testify goes against everything he's been trained to do,"but that on the other hand, "He's a law enforcement official....He's not aboutto go with a contempt route or lie."                           USAT says today's involvement of Rehnquist amounts to a "high noonshowdown" between the Clinton administration and Kenneth Starr, and that theissue of Secret Service confidentiality is the most contentious issue yet inStarr's investigation of Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton. The Postsays some senior officials at Justice argued against filing the Supreme Courtappeal because of the long odds.            The NYT says the Lockheed pullback "signals the end of major mergers in thenation's military industry." The company board voted Thursday afternoon to endthe takeover, which had already been approved by both sets of stockholders andwhich would have created the nation's largest military contractor. TheLAT says the decision was made because the company couldn't see how toavoid a court fight. The deal, says the NYT , is the largest ever undonebecause of government opposition. The resistance stemmed from a fear that thedeal would leave Lockheed in control of so much of Northrop's electronicsbusiness that competition would be suppressed and prices driven up. TheTimes quotes DOJ antitrust chief Joel Klein applauding the development.(He did not, however, say he's pleased that the decision leaves the Americanservice member free to combine missile and radar systems as he/she seesfit.)                           USAT 's front section cover story on the closeness of the SecretService to the presidents they protect reports that they routinely hold him byhis belt when he goes into a crowd, and have been known to disguise themselvesas cap-and-gowned students at graduation speeches and as priests during papalvisits. Not to mention that they go through his dresser drawers looking forbugs and often follow him in to the bathroom.            The Wall Street Journal "Washington Wire" reports that fewreporters have signed up for Al Gore's upcoming trip to Russia. The budgets ofmany news organizations, the paper explains, have been stretched thin bytravels with Clinton.            The WP 's "Reliable Source" column reports that both Chelsea Clintonand Monica Lewinsky were named to a list of "non-anorexic achievers" put out byLane Bryant, the plus-sized women's clothing company. All the women on the listare, says the company's PR sheet, "accomplished, fashionable and beautiful."The column then goes on to quite sensibly wonder what it is that Lewinsky hasaccomplished.
