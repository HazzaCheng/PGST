                                 Elvis Leaves the Building            Finally, after a solid week, some of the big dailies lead with monographsthat aren't Monicagraphs. The Washington Post leads with the indictment of Clintonintimate Charlie Trie and another Democratic Party fund-raiser--the first inconnection with the Department of Justice's investigation into the 1996campaign. (This story is the off-lead at the Los AngelesTimes , but the New YorkTimes runs it deep inside.) And the LAT goes with MadeleineAlbright's pronouncement that if allies can't be convinced, the U.S. is readyto launch military strikes against Iraq on its own. Albright added that thediplomatic string is running out and reiterated the U. S. position: U.N.weapons inspectors must have unconditional access to Iraqi sites. (Elsewhere,this story doesn't get that much play either: at the NYT it only gets areefer on the front page, below the fold.) USA Todayleads with a new poll indicating the strength of President Clinton'spost-scandal popular support, and the NYT goes with new details aboutthe last White House meeting between Bill and Monica.                           USAT says its new poll (of 684 adults, done in concert with CNN andGallup) shows that after his State of the Union speech, Clinton enjoys hishighest approval rating ever--67 percent. The paper also reports that formerWhite House chief of staff Leon Panetta was questioned yesterday byprosecutors. (This news is also flagged in the Wall Street Journal front-page news box and on theNYT front.) USAT also states that Starr investigators picked upevidence from a former teacher of Monica Lewinsky's, who says he had an affairwith her.            The paper also offers a glimpse into Monica's vie en scandale: long dayssequestered in the Watergate with her mother, watching TV and talking on thephone in code. Her lawyer is quoted saying that she watched Clinton's SOTUaddress. "She thought he did a good job with it," he says. "She thinks he'sdone a good job as president. She still considers him a friend."            Pursuing a thread first pulled by yesterday's LAT , the NYT and WP delve into that December 28th White House meetingbetween the president and his ex-intern, prompted by her concerns over asubpoena in the Paula Jones case. The Times reports Lewinsky claims thatClinton told her at the time that she could testify her visits to him at theWhite House were to see his secretary, and that he suggested that she couldavoid testifying altogether by being in New York City. The paper goes on topoint out that besides the issue of what Clinton actually said at this meeting,it would be "ethically questionable" for a defendant in a civil lawsuit merelyto discuss the case with a potential witness already subpoenaed by theplaintiffs.            The Times says this meeting was confirmed by a White House aide,while the Post says the White House declined to comment about it and hasrefused to release the relevant entry logs.            The LAT front and the NYT inside report anincrease in the number of applications to the University of California fromblacks (up 4.9 percent) and Latinos (up 7 percent). This confoundsmuch-publicized concerns that the school's decision to end affirmative actionlast year would have a chilling effect on minority applications.            Dick Morris' verbal incontinence yesterday about Bill and Hillary's sexlives seems to have had immediate results. White House spokesman Mike McCurrytells the Post that, although in recent weeks Clinton would occasionallytalk to Morris, "I doubt that will ever happen again."            A big color shot of the president greeting an exuberant crowd of youngpeople sits athwart the NYT lead story about the Monica meeting andastride its story about his trip yesterday to the Midwest. From just oneglance, it's hard to say which story the picture goes with. In a way, it goeswith both. It was in fact taken yesterday at Clinton's appearance at theUniversity of Illinois. But it captures the very same hands-on political bodychemistry apparent in those shots we've all seen by now of Bill with Monica.Indeed, of the eleven people in the photograph looking up at and/or reachingfor Clinton, eight of them are women. They are all smiling at him.
