                                 Energizer Rabbit Run                           Woodchuck , producedfor Energizer Batteries by TBWA Chiat/Day and Epoch Films.            Political pollsters arguethat most commercials don't really work--that viewer recall of a product andits claimed attributes is actually remarkably low, and that the research"proving" the efficacy of the ads is largely controlled by the ad agencies thatmade the ads in the first place. (That's mild, by the way, compared with whatthe commercial advertisers say about the quality and ethics of politicalads.)            The Energizer Bunny is anexception to this rule. Batteries are practically a commodity, but thelong-running Bunny campaign has implanted the message of long-lastingreliability in the public consciousness. The Bunny is now almost a culturalartifact, and if the "keeps going and going" message is to be extended, it mustbe restated in ways that build on the image without boring the viewers.                           Woodchuck is a casestudy of the process--and a case of cultural updating. In a series of quickcuts--narrative bites that put old slogans into younger voices and visualechoes of popular entertainment--the spot extends the Energizer message to anew generation.            As the camera pulls backfrom a television set showing the Energizer Bunny in action, we see a group oftwentysomething guys--in T-shirts, shorts, chinos, with an occasionalbeard--gathered around a van or a utility vehicle. One of them talks about howlong "this thing's been goin', " and the "obsession" to chase it. (Where arethe women: Don't they buy batteries?) The group piles in and sets off down theroad while the rotating radar on top of the van searches out its target--like ascene out of Twister . Like the storm-chasers, we're told, this group has"gone days without seeing anything." Here and later, the borrowed images fromTwister are amplified by the searchers talking not to the viewers, butto what appears to be a third-party documentary filmmaker. The absence of musicadds to the documentary feel.            Staring through binoculars,one of the searchers expresses the frustration inherent in any search for anot-so-Holy Grail--whether it's Elvis, a UFO, or the Energizer Bunny: "It'stoying with us again." Next we encounter an X-Files moment--a blurryblack-and-white photo that's even less distinct than the ones of flying saucersthat are the talismans of an entire subculture. The searcher insists that thephoto is real, that it is proof: "Right there you can see its ears and itsdrum."            "Come on, baby!" One of thesearchers is in a field, trying to capture an undeniable video of the rabbit.It's reminiscent of the storm-chasers who miss the twister because they gonorth instead of south. The next scene is a closer rear view of the truck, theradar antenna relentlessly turning. Look closely: Is that a set of rabbit earsin the mirrorlike object mounted atop the van on our right? The almostsubliminal image tells us, but not the searchers, that they may have missed therabbit.            Thinking that they'vespotted the Bunny, the group clambers out of the vehicle, shouting and firingoff cameras--but it's just a woodchuck. The story reverses a fairy tale thatthese guys aren't that many years distant from: The hare is beating thefour-wheeled gadget--the rich tortoise of the '90s.            Inside, a searcher gives theoff-camera interviewer an explanation that again repeats the Energizer slogan:"It just keeps going and going--and therefore, you yourself have to keep goingand going." That might also serve as a mantra for the '90s generation, seekingthe constantly moving targets of meaning and success.            The spotcloses with the name of the product chyroned across the Bunny-searching vanthat just keeps going. Woodchuck refrains from identifying the productbecause it's selling the name of the product, not the product itself. And ifyou don't think the names of commodity products matter much in the marketplace,then why do people pay more for Calvins than they do for Fruit of theLooms?            --RobertShrum
