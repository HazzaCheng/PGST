                                 Paint It Black            The New York Times ,Washington Post , and Los AngelesTimes lead with President Clinton's surprise announcement that hisproposed 1999 federal budget will be balanced. USA Todayleads with turmoil at the opening of the Unabomber trial (which also getsconsiderable front-page coverage, along with big pictures of Ted Kaczynski'sbrother and mother entering the courthouse, at the Post and the twoTimes ).            The Post says the budget announcement marks the shift from the"politics of austerity" to the "politics of prosperity." The NYT says it is the "fiscal equivalent of the fall of theBerlin Wall." After all, all the dailies observe, the federal budget was lastbalanced in 1969. Indeed, the Times notes, no president has eventried to offer a balanced one since 1971. No wonder that the NYTsenses "euphoria" in Washington. "You'll see surpluses as far as the eye cansee" is the quote of the day from presidential advisor Gene Sperling, andeverybody has it. As the Times observes, this is a pretty dramatic shiftfrom just this past weekend when administration officials were discouragingtalk of a near-term surplus. (A Washington explanation for this is that theadministration wanted to preserve the momentum that comes with a bigsurprise.)            The NYT and USAT remind readers that two weeks ago NewtGingrich urged Clinton to propose a balanced budget for 1999 and theTimes remarks that "Clinton never mentions it, but a tax increase signedat great political cost by George Bush began the work of deficit reduction."The Post totes up the political causes, but says the development arose"mostly because of six years of relentless economic growth."            The WP budget lead stresses high up Clinton's view that the firstorder of business for any surplus is balancing the budget, not cutting taxes orincreasing spending. The LAT budget story also goes high with Clinton'swarning against any big new tax cuts. The WP reports that a spokesmanfor House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer complained about Clinton's"pre-emptive strike against tax relief."                           USAT reports that as soon as the Unabomber judge took the bench onMonday, Kaczynski, in a low calm voice asked to "revisit" the issue of hisattorneys, apparently referring to his desire to jettison them because theystill intend to introduce non-medical evidence of his mental instability. (Thepaper also cites an AP report that Kaczynski objects to the presence at thetrial of brother.) Then the defendant went into a four-hour conference with thejudge, without prosecutors present.            The Wall Street Journal "Work Week" column gives some insightinto the concept of going postal. Postal workers, it explains, can't strike andso their grievances accumulate unresolved in much greater numbers than in otherlines of work. The Journal quotes a government report stating that thecurrent backlog of them numbers nearly 70,000.            The Journal also brings news of a coming marketplace battle as Nike enters the sports equipmentbiz. Among its products will be a lightweight clamshell baseball glove,with plastic and wire instead of laces. (The company is considering lining theglove with leather, because right now, "it smells like glue.") Entrenchedequipment manufacturer Rawlings is set to respond with such products as abaseball containing a microchip that enables it to calculate the speed at whichit's thrown, a datum displayed on an LCD on the baseball's skin.            Both the WP and LAT run stories today reporting that the WhiteHouse is, in the LAT 's words, "fuming," about thatFirst-Couple-on-the-beach picture. The Post says that Clinton himself says he feels the picture was an invasion ofhis privacy and also reports that the Agence-France Presse official (aformer Bush staffer) who assigned the photographers says that if the presidentdidn't want them there, "the Secret Service could have made it happen." Inshort, the White House faces a dilemma: either it is being less than straightabout whether the pictures were staged or the Secret Service suffered a majorsecurity breakdown.
