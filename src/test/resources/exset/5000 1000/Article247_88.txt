                                 Fondlee, Kathleen: Isikoff on the Stand?            A potentially significant conflict is opening up between Michael Isikoff,the Newsweek reporter who's been a driving force in the Flytrap scandal,and Julie Steele, the erstwhile friend of Kathleen Willey who says Willey toldher to lie to Isikoff. As discussed in Chatterboxes for 2/3 and 2/18, Isikoffreported as long ago as last August that Steele initially told him (Version #1)that Willey had told her about an unwanted Clinton pass on the day it happened.Isikoff also reported, in the same August story, that Steele then recanted, andtold him (Version #2) that Willey had only "told her about the incident weeksafter it happened, saying only that the president had made a pass at her." NowSteele claims that Willey didn't mention anything at all about a pass, wantedor not--Steele has signed an affidavit (Version #3) claiming that Willey "neversaid anything to suggest that President Clinton made sexual advances towardher." What's more--and this is the key point--Steele, through her lawyerdenies telling Isikoff what he reported she told him last summer afterher recantation, namely that Willey had still talked of a "pass," if not anunwanted pass.            This is a direct conflict; the question isn't what Willey told Steele butwhat Steele told Isikoff. Isikoff says Steele told him Willey talked of a"pass." Steele denies telling Isikoff this. (In effect, she says there was noVersion #2) ... But there's more: Isikoff also reported, in the March 9 issueof Newsweek , that Steele had told him a second time that Willey hadindeed mentioned a sexual advance. He wrote: "Just two weeks ago, however,Steele repeated to Newsweek that Willey had told her about a sexual'overture' by Clinton." Does Steele deny telling Isikoff this as well?Presumably yes. (Her lawyer, Nancy Luque, said she would try to reach herclient and call Chatterbox back. Chatterbox is still waiting.) ...            Unless Willey's credibility is somehow destroyed, this isn't a petty sidedispute. It bears directly on Steele's credibility--has she changed her storyto exculpate Clinton?--and Steele is currently the main witness underminingKathleen Willey. Whom to believe? Isikoff is standing by his story. "We have nointention of printing any retraction," he says. Chatterbox doesn't know JulieSteele; it does know Isikoff. Chatterbox's money is on him. This doesn't soundlike something he'd make a mistake about, and he wouldn't print an untruth. ...Could it be a case of confusion and miscommunication? A lot depends on thespecifics of just how Isikoff grilled Steele, which he presumably did. Whichbrings us to ...                           A second issue: If Willey remains important, it's hard to see whyKenneth Starr shouldn't try to get Isikoff's testimony regarding what Steeletold him. But will Isikoff testify if subpoenaed? ... Chatterbox's unsolicitedadvice: Spill your guts out, Mike! It's not as if you'll be protecting theidentity of a confidential source. Reporters, like other citizens, have anobligation to testify. The alternative view, that reporters have a special roleand special rights, is snooty corporatism! (See Chatterbox 2/26) ... Butprobably Isikoff will resist ...                           A third issue: why doesn't the press report Steele's purported changeof story? If you read Time you have no idea that there was an issueregarding Steele's Version #2. ( Time just reports that Steele says"Willey didn't describe it as sexual.") Maybe Time doesn't want to getinto a pissing match with a rival Newsweek reporter. (Oh, go ahead!).But what's the New York Times ' excuse? Times reporter JohnBroder's front page story on the Steele recantation manages to run about 24inches, not counting a reprint of the Steele affidavit, without mentioning thissignificant factual dispute .... That's the second time Broder has embarrassedhimself in three weeks. (The first? His sophomoric sneering at SidneyBlumenthal. See Chatterbox 3/1) ...
