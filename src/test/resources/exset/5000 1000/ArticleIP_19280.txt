                                 Are Taxes Heavier Than Ever?            Republicans propose usingthe federal budget surplus to finance a tax cut. They argue that the tax burdenon the average American has grown. A tax cut may be a good or a bad idea forother reasons, but the notion of a growing tax burden rests on two highlymisleading statistics.            The first is that "atypical mother and father who both work paid nearly 40 percent of their incomein taxes," as Republican Rep. Jennifer Dunn stated in her reply to the Stateof the Union address. "That means," Dunn explained, "40 cents of everydollar they earned went to the government." Dunn also noted that the statistic"really bothers me." Dunn can stop tormenting herself; the 40 percent figure isbogus.            The number derives from a study conducted by the TaxFoundation, a conservative research group. The study found that "typical"families pay 36.7 percent of their income in total taxes, which is commonlyrounded up to a neat 40 percent. That's a sneaky increase of almost a tenthright there. But even the 36.7 percent figure is inflated. (These errors werebrought to light by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a moderatelyliberal--and methodologically sound--research group.) For instance, the TaxFoundation assumes that the average taxpayer pays an average share of estateand capital gains taxes, which is absurd. Most people do not have any capitalgains at all, and the estate tax only affects inheritances of at least $625,000(and actually a lot more than that unless you're exceptionally stupid aboutestate planning). The "typical" taxpayer paid estate taxes last year in thesame sense that the "typical" golfer scored some fraction of a hole in one.That is, in almost no sense whatever.            Even more bizarrely, the Tax Foundation study countsas part of the tax burden things that aren't taxes, such as private pensioncontributions by government workers or rental fees on property owned by thegovernment. If you lease office space in the Ronald Reagan Trade Center, shouldyour rent be considered a tax? The Tax Foundation's miscounting of nontax taxesalone overstates the federal tax burden by one-seventh.            Legitimate differences ofinterpretation do exist. But the Tax Foundation's calculation of the federaltax burden, which is nearly a quarter larger than the Congressional BudgetOffice's, and half again larger than the Joint Tax Committee's, is beyond thepale.            A more sophisticated statistical salvo, which conservativepundits have shot off recently, is that federal tax revenues now consume thehighest percentage of the gross domestic product since World War II. Thisnumber is true: Last year Washington took in 20.5 percent of GDP, whereas inthe decade before Clinton took office, the number ranged between 17.5 percentand 19.2 percent.            But this is misleading.The federal cup runneth over, in part, because the raging stock market hasproduced a gusher of capital gains tax revenues. But GDP does not includeprofits from stocks. This means that during a strong stock market, thenumerator (tax revenues) will shoot up, but the denominator (GDP) will not.            The main problem with the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio, though,isn't accuracy. It's relevance. During the heyday of the Reagan deficits,conservatives maintained, quite logically, that the important statistic was nothow much the government took in but how much it spent: Big government financedthrough borrowing was no better than big government financed through taxing.Today, the federal government spends 3 percent of GDP less than it did whenPresident Bush left office.            Leading Republicans, who now complain about analleged huge increase in tax revenues, insisted back in 1993 that PresidentClinton's tax increase would cause a decline in tax revenues. (This wasthe "free lunch" logic in reverse: If a tax cut will increase revenues, a taxincrease will reduce them.) That prediction failed spectacularly: Tax revenueshave boomed with the economy. Now the boom they denied could even happen hasbecome their main justification for a tax cut.
