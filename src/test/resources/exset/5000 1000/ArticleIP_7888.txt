Not AllJewish Women Are Like Lewinsky                        The lastparagraph of the Nov. 9 "Today's Papers" struck a discordant note with us. After catalogingpejoratives associated with Jewish women, which a group is trying to counter inthe media, the paragraph asserts that Monica Lewinsky fits them all. Thisimplies, unfairly and falsely, that Lewinsky is somehow representative ofJewish women. That implication is snide and condescending. Surely you wouldn'tbe so flippant with a list of pejoratives associated with another minoritygroup--blacks or Hispanics, for instance--or pretend that one negativelyperceived member of the group stands for the whole. The "joke" was anti-Semiticand unfunny. It is particularly annoying to read this on the anniversary ofKristallnacht .            -- Maud Lavin andLocke Bowman Chicago                           Scott Shuger responds:I did not create the list of pejoratives thought to be associated in the publicmind with Jewish women; the group of Jewish women did. I also wrote thateradicating that stereotype was a fine goal. I did not write that MonicaLewinsky was representative of Jewish women. I wrote that she fit the group'slist and that, given the tremendous exposure she's had this year, thiscertainly reinforces the stereotype and therefore makes the group's aim moredifficult to achieve. To pretend that Monica is not a problem for the image ofJewish women is like pretending that O.J. Simpson is not a problem for theimage of black men. To notice such things is not bigotry. But wanting to ignorethem is.                                       Holes inthe DNA                        Your Nov. 2 "Chatterbox" on Jefferson and the DNA tests is erroneous. The DNAtests only prove that a Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings' lastson. But that could include any of Jefferson's six male cousins--the sons ofhis father's brother. The more important finding is that the DNA tests proveJefferson--or any other Jefferson--could not be the father of Hemings'first son, the one who was born after she returned from France with ThomasJefferson and his family, pregnant at the time.            Historically, the Hemingsfamily always claimed that this first son was fathered by Jefferson. Theinteresting question now is who was the father of her first son, since he couldnot have been a Jefferson. And since we can't trace the paternity of her otherchildren because there are no male descendants, the likelihood that thepaternity was from other men is as likely as any other possible answer, nowthat we know that she had her first child by a non-Jefferson family member,i.e., that she had children by at least two different men from differentfamilies.            Finally,the largest obstacle in proving that it was Thomas Jefferson who was the fatherof Hemings' last son is the fact that Jefferson was 65 years old at that time,with no record of potency for almost two decades. You jump to conclusions tooquickly, forgetting that scientific answers such as DNA tests are most reliablein providing negative answers--and often ambiguous in providing positiveanswers.            -- Harold L.Orbach Manhattan, Kan.                           Micromiracle                        MichaelLewis is a breath of fresh air in his "Dispatches"on the Microsoft case. He reports it to us mortals in a funny andunderstandable way without putting in so much information that it becomesunintelligible. He is a breath of fresh air. I also think it is commendablethat his articles, although unfavorable to Microsoft in the main, are beinghosted on a Microsoft-owned site. This is refreshing.            -- MaryNugent Crumlin, Northern Ireland                           GuatemalaGringos                        I realizethat "The Breakfast Table" feature is supposed to be light,breezy, and chatter-driven, but little did I realize that Kathie Lee Giffordwas doing double duty this week. It is heartening to know that despite nothaving reaped the obvious benefits of British colonialism, Guatemala stillrepresents a cheap silver buying opportunity for fat American wallets.
