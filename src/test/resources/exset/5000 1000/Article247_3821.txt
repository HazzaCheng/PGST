                                 To Intel Analysts: Margins Aren't Everything                        Today's Nasdaq sell-off was relatively steep (although you have to rememberthat with the Nasdaq near 3,000, 71 points is just not panic-inducing). Andwhile picking proximate causes for market movements is a fool's game, I'll be afool and point to two important reasons: bond prices and Intel.            With the yield on the 30-year bond now at a two-year high, at 6.3 percent,bonds are looking like a tastier investment, and there's still a lot of concernthat the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Nov. 16 meeting.Neither of those things are good for stocks. As for Intel, it came in withquarterly numbers that were a couple of cents shy of analysts' expectations andgot crushed as a result, with much of the rest of the tech sector falling insympathy (or empathy, or whatever you want to call it).            Intel is a true tech bellwether, since its chips go into most of the PCs inthe world, meaning that if it's having trouble, a lot of other companiesprobably are, too. And given that in the past few months expectations for thesemiconductor industry have risen sharply, Intel's failure to blow awayestimates--something it hasn't done, by the way, for a couple of years--came asa shock. But there are good reasons to think that today's sell-off was overdoneand that whatever trouble Intel is having has less to do with the "tech sector"(whatever that mythical beast is) in general and more to do with Intel inparticular.            The company, for instance, took great pains to point out that demand for itschips was not the problem. In fact, in a curiously un-Intel-like performance,it was manufacturing the chips, especially its newest chips, that tripped thecompany up. Intel delayed the release of its highest-powered Pentium processor,Coppermine, and a new chipset for memory chips because it couldn't hit theproduction schedules its customers needed. Had they shipped as planned, Intelwould have had no trouble meeting estimates. Traditionally, it's Intel'scompetition, most notably Advanced Micro Devices, that finds deadlinesbothersome. But apparently even masters of manufacturing can trip up.            There's a bigger point than just manufacturing mishaps at stake in the Intelsell-off, though, and that's what you might call the "fetishization of margins"problem, which I touched on in last week's discussion of Amazon.com's zShops initiative. Nearly all the analystswho marked down Intel today emphasized that the company's gross margins--whichequals revenue from products minus the cost of sales for those products--fellin the most recent quarter. Now, they fell 0.2 percent, from 58.9 percent to58.7 percent, which is statistically insignificant. But the important point,for the analysts, was that they didn't rise.            What this demonstrates, supposedly, is the impact on Intel of having to sellso many more of its cheap chip--the Celeron--rather than its higher-pricedPentiums. As consumers have got used to the sub-$1,000 PC, Intel has had tomake chips that cater to that market, and naturally they earn less profit onthe $80 Celeron than on the $250 Pentium III. Analysts see this as a slipperyslope, so that pretty soon Intel will watch its margins driven down to asliver.            Well, maybe. But somehow I doubt it. In the first place, Intel's margins arestill remarkably high for a manufacturing company (and would have been muchhigher had they shipped Coppermine). More to the point, falling margins arenot, in and of themselves, evidence that things are falling apart. If you dothings right, turning inventory more rapidly, you can make it up on volume. Thevalue of a business depends not on how hefty its profit margins are but on howefficiently it uses capital, and you can use capital efficiently by setting upa revolving door of low-margin products (Wal-Mart), a steady stream ofhigh-margin products (most banks), or a mix of the two (which is where Intel isgoing). So let's wait a little while before deciding that Intel is really onthe road to destruction.
