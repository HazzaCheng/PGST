                                 Hankering for the Old Hanks                        As I'm sure someone has reminded you, Sarah, Samantha Morton in Sweet andLowdown isn't a "deaf-mute" but a mere mute: How else could she worship theprotagonist's artistry? Better than a mute, I might add: She is a mute who doeslaundry. It's the talent for laundry that puts her closest to Woody Allen'sheart, I bet.            Yes, we can all agree, Roger demonstrates unparalleled "consideration forreaders" and "habitual fairness." Roger, you have evolved into the conscienceof the American cinema. But I ask you: Isn't that role sometimes paralyzing?You treat The Green Mile as if it's a humanist milestone on the order ofTo Kill a Mockingbird . But it has been more than a third of a centurysince Mockingbird 's Great White Father and that shambling, saintly blackmartyr who pays for the sex crimes of white men--and in-between came thecivil-rights movement. Isn't it time to retire this archetype? Isn't it soviolently at odds with reality that it threatens to do more harm than good?(How disillusioning that some African-Americans have rough edges.) And whileI'm at it: Why'd you like that damn Jar Jar picture???            I'm sympathetic to your complaints about critics who loudly swap opinions atscreenings, but I think it's more an issue for you (and Elvis, now) than forme. I could broadcast my views over the PA system and no one would much care,whereas word of your likes or dislikes would promptly make its way through theranks to studio presidents, CEOs, and world leaders. (I refrain from sayingwhat I think after most movies not because I want to tantalize people butbecause I reserve the right to change my mind in the course of writing areview.) Anyway, I'm always happy to eavesdrop on what people are saying inscreening rooms or theaters--I often use that stuff in my columns, the tackierthe better.            Sarah: I hate to say it, but the "guyness" in this year's movies might bethe corollary to all those young, hot-dogging male directors whom we've beencelebrating. But there have still been a ton of great femaleperformances. John Sayles, the last proud liberal-feminist, wrote a beautifulpart for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in Limbo that she turned into oneof the comebacks of the decade. Like Janet McTeer in Tumbleweeds , sheplays a woman who's a, well, tumbleweed who gravitates to men she shouldn'tgravitate to and takes her long-suffering daughter along for the fall. Isuppose you'd say these are soft roles, victims' roles, but both actresses givethese women complex consciousnesses--they fall and watch themselves falling,and they subtly comment on their trajectories.            A very, very strange performance is Sigourney Weaver's in A Map of theWorld . As in The Good Mother , the issue is a woman'sself-destructive impulses in a society that has fixed expectations of howmothers and caregivers should behave. She can't forgive herself for a tragicaccident on her property, and in ways that I'm still trying to sort out, shehelps to bring about her own--and her family's--near ruin. Weaver plays thiswoman from the outset as unhinged, and the first-time director, Scott Elliot,doesn't modulate her craziness enough. But by the end, the performance makessense: It's as if she's scything her way home through a thicket of her ownunmanageable emotions--and she gets there.            As for Hanks, let me say that I think he's still a wonderful actor but amsorry that such a heavy spirit has descended upon him. He was once thebreeziest of goofballs--but with a greater emotional range than almost anyother goofball. A few weeks back I was reminiscing about the old Hanks withPauline Kael. (Yes, I admit it--I've talked to her. I'm a fellow traveler.) Weboth confessed a fondness for Turner and Hooch . Then I said, "It's toobad they had to kill Hooch, though. I mean, what big-funny-dog movie ends withthe dog getting blown away?"            "Be thankful," said Pauline. "If Hanks made it today there would be amemorial service."            See you tomorrow.
