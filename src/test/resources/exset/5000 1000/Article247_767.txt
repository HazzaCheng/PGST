                                 Netescape            A major business development, AOL's nearly consummated purchase ofNetscape, leads at USA Today , the Washington Post , and Los AngelesTimes . The move also gets a front-page leader at the Wall Street Journal . (According to the AP, the Journal online edition and the new Newsweek brokethe story.) The New York Timesputs the story above the fold, but leads with Iraq's latest weapons inspectionsnit and off-leads with word that driven by budget constraints as much as bythe reduced threat of nuclear attack, the Pentagon is quietly recommendingunilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear warheads. Both the NYT and LAT gotop-front with the same picture of Bill Clinton: At the Korean DMZ completewith howitzer backdrop, decked out in scrambled-eggs ball-cap and Army fieldjacket, he's doing a grip-and-grin with a bunch of soldiers. Judging by his105mm smile, he's finally enjoying the military lifestyle.            The papers report that the AOL/Netscape deal is actually triangular, withAOL buying Netscape for about $4 billion in stock and then licensing Netscape'se-commerce software to Sun Microsystems, which hopes to use it as a vehicle fordisseminating its Java language as an alternative to Microsoft's Windows.            Everybody reports that the deal could have big ramifications for Microsoft,with USAT making the point that the deal formally bonds three companieswhose charges that Microsoft uses monopoly power to block competitors' productshave played central roles in the current anti-trust trial. Indeed, theNYT says that the companies were emboldened to deal because of theirperception that the case would weaken MS. But USAT quotes a Microsoftspokesman's claim that the deal would "blow an enormous hole in thegovernment's case," because it shows that MS' competitors have retained theability to change the landscape overnight--in ways that the government claimsis illegal when Microsoft tries it. The LAT and WSJ make thispoint too but the Journal adds that on the other hand, the governmentcould argue that Netscape was driven into AOL's arms by Microsoft.                           USAT 's front reports that one of the highest-ranking female lawenforcement officials in the government, a higher-up at Treasury, is beinginvestigated to see if she used her position to steer government business to asubordinate who is a close friend.            The WP front covers a lawsuit in which a man is suing a woman forbecoming pregnant against his will--she had, he says,promised to take birth control pills. The woman claims that she became pregnantaccidentally. That factual issue may be settled at trial, but it seems thatthere is a larger legal issue well worth addressing. Since court findings ofpaternity cost the imputed fathers eighteen years' worth of support, it seemsonly fair that women be held accountable for any promises they make aboutattempting to remain childless. In the absence of that, a woman's promise totake charge of birth control and then not doing so remains the only form ofmonetary fraud Today's Papers can think of that is not only not punished, butis in fact regularly rewarded.            The LAT 's "Column One" does a long take-out on the increasingattempts by companies to market their products inside schools, especiallypublic schools. Everybody from software manufacturers (Microsoft being one ofthem) to cheese companies has been finding new ways to do this, and parentsare, says the paper, finding more product solicitations coming home in theirkids' backpacks. The good deals and cut rates are often dangled as a way tohelp schools get stuff they need, which is particularly attractive to schooladministrators strapped for funds in an environment in which voters keepturning down so many school bond issues. The LAT admits itschool-markets too, by handing out free papers on campuses, ostensibly topromote reading, but also to increase the paper's circulation.            The WP runs an AP item about the opening of the 6,400-square-foothouse about to become the home of Kenny and Bobby McCaughey and theirseptuplets and their other child. The story describes such features as a 648square foot playroom, a bathroom with a "Roman tub," and an intercom systemconnecting the various parts of the house. The story says scores of businessesand residents contributed materials, services, money and land for the new home.Yet no money figures are ever mentioned--an interesting omission when thetypical story about welfare recipients enumerates the monthly "giveaway" checkdown to the penny. The story's lucre lacunae comport well with the locals'theories about how all this came about--it quotes a neighbor saying, "Lookslike God is going to provide all these things."
