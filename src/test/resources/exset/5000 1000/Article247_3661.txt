                                 Why Is Janet Maslin Leaving the Times?            If Culturebox didn't know better, she would say that Janet Maslin was drivenfrom the New York Times by the shame of almost having Lee Siegel agreewith her.                           Wait a minute. Maslin, the lead film critic, is leaving theTimes ? Yup. According to a memo circulated to the staff Tuesday afternoonby arts editor John Darnton, at the end of the year "she will leave the paperand try life without deadlines." Did she quit or was she fired? It's apretty abrupt departure, and she has no other job lined up, but who knows?What else did Darnton say? He hinted that the job wore her out: "In1973, Hollywood turned out 229 movies. Last year, the figure was more thandouble--475. Janet's workload doubled correspondingly but she bore it withcustomary grace and Stakhanovite fortitude." What is Stakhanovitefortitude? Stakhanov was a Soviet miner famous for regularly exceeding hisquotas. His prolific labors were celebrated by Stalin and reviled by everyoneelse. In the post-Soviet era, the adjective merely denotes a hard worker,though there's a slight hint that one's being accused of being the teacher'spet.                           Is that why the Times got rid of                her, if that's whatit did? Who gets fired for working too hard? But she has taken a lot offlaklately for being so chipper and enthusiastic about movies everyone else hated,such as The Phantom Menace and Eyes Wide Shut. AnotherTimes critic, Michiko Kakutani, even wrote an essay implicitlycriticizing Maslin for credulously embracing Kubrick's last film. Wouldn'tit be unusual to fire a film critic for not being harsh enough? It wouldcertainly say something about the difference between the East and West coasts.Can you imagine the arts editor of the Los Angeles Times dressing downhis lead critic for sucking up to the studios too much? Well, why didshe suck up so much? In his novel Max Jamison, Wilfrid Sheedshows how the rigors of reviewing crap can reduce a critic to an embitteredhack. Perhaps Maslin, striving to avoid that fate, stumbled onto one equallyunfortunate--she let hope triumph over experience. What would you do ifyou had to watch 475 Hollywood movies a year?                           OK, I buy that, sort of. But who's Lee Siegel? Lee Siegel is aregular contributor to the New Republic who has become famous fortaking a hatchet to all subjects great and small. Novelists Barbara Kingsolverand Kurt Andersen, the New York Times "Arts and Ideas" page, a privatesalon of left-leaning intellectuals, the entire city of Manhattan--all aretreated with the same withering contempt. All are seen with the same unwaveringcertainty as avatars of America's cultural decline. Siegel's latest cause,espoused in the current issue of Harper's , is Eyes Wide Shut ,which only he among all critics in America has realized is a great work of art.All the other critics in America--"our official arbiters of culture"--"havelost the gift of being able to comprehend a work of art that does not reflecttheir immediate experience; they have become afraid of genuine art." All exceptMaslin. Siegel, in his Siegelesque fashion, can't quite bring himself to giveher credit for insight, even though she was practically the only critic topraise the film: "Not a single critic, not even those few who claimed to likeEyes Wide Shut , made any attempt to understand the film on its ownartistic terms."                           So what does he have to do with Maslin leaving the Times? Well,nothing, now that you mention it. They couldn't have less in common or lesssympathy for one another's worldviews (if Maslin is even aware of Siegel's, sheis not likely to be kindly disposed toward it). If Culturebox were making apoint, rather than manufacturing a conceit, it would be this: that these twoextremes of contrarian opinion--Maslin's brittle cheerfulness and Siegel'sapocalyptic dourness--have somehow brought their holders to the same lonelyplace. If I were her, I'd leave too.
