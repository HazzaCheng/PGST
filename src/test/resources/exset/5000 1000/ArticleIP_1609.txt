                                 Drug Rehabilitation                           Daifotis , producedby Carter Eskew of Bozell-Eskew for the Pharmaceutical Researchers andManufacturers Assn.            The producers ofDaifotis faced a Herculean task: Survey data showed that their client,the pharmaceutical industry, had an image problem. Like your friendlyneighborhood politician, your friendly neighborhood drug company was consideredanything but. Au contraire , the unhappy consensus was that it wasavaricious, monopolistic, loyal only to the bottom line.            Appropriately, the mancharged with the task is a past master at peddling image as product. Head ofthe ad team for Clinton-Gore '92, Carter Eskew has since migrated to thecommercial side of the business. And Daifotis , like the other spots inthe Bozell-Eskew campaign for the pharmaceutical industry, marks theconvergence of political and commercial advertising. Using one of the former'smost powerful ploys, it chooses to come at the viewer obliquely via a humanface, a human tragedy, that carefully fronts the industry behind.            The issue here isosteoporosis and the speaker, a young woman whose life it touched. "Mygrandmother had osteoporosis," she says, briefly humanizing the 10 millionvictims who might have otherwise been collapsed into a single statistic by theopening chyron. Here and through the spot, she speaks directly to the camera,her earnest face and voice limning with hope the shots of an ailing elder andof single, bleak lines of text that bring the disease to life and the livingroom. Her speech seems spontaneous, not scripted: The desired effect, ofcourse, is that she personalize the industry she is promoting, edging it intoour consciousness as a provider of solutions--nay, as a caring providerof solutions.            A black-and-white photographbriefly recalls happier times, then makes way for this young professional(she's wearing the mandatory blue suit) describing her grandmother'sdegeneration, her increasing frailty and the consequent reversal of roles: "Ihad to carry her and hold her as I remember her always carrying me." As we readthe astounding numbers--62,000 osteoporosis victims will enter nursing homesthis year, few to return home--she tells us how the disease operates, of softbones that yield to the gentlest touch. There is a solution in sight, however,and she tells us that she is a part of it. The stage set, the audience primed,the spot can reveal that she is a pharmaceutical-company researcher who "reallyfeels" she is making a difference, that she is a proud member of a group thathas found a way to "increase the bone mass in people." And "her company"--thisis the clincher, which, fusing human face and industry, testifies to a missionaccomplished--has developed one of these rehabilitative drugs.            But the company makes only abrief appearance, and the spot seesaws right back to the human issue. Aclose-up of the woman's hands reinforces the fact that osteoporosis couldbecome anyone's reality. Going behind the figures and images, she talks of thepsychological impact of the disease, of the victim's discovery that she is"that frail old woman she never wanted to become." Then the counterpoint, theexplicit projection of the young woman's company as the harbinger of hope: Itis helping over 1 million women, and she, its human face, is tireless in hereffort to find a drug that will enable a woman to "climb stairs without fear,stand a little taller."            Reinforcing the commitmentand humanity that energize this individual and the behemoth behind her, thefinal chyrons stress that this is no pat pitch:  la political spots that seekto convince the viewer that she is on the threshold of a wider truth,Daifotis serves up a toll-free number. This isn't just a 60-second spot,we are supposed to decide; more information is a mere phone call away. And thisisn't the same old drug industry either; "America's Pharmaceutical Companies"are in your corner, pulling for you. They're new and improved, like Labor in'97 or the Democrats in '92. And before you carp about old wine and newbottles, old dogs and new tricks, take a look at those election returns.Something sure worked.                           --RobertShrum
