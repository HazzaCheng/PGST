In an interview with theFinancial Times of London,Madeleine Albright said Thursday she had run out of metaphors to describe thestate of the Middle East peace process. But this did not prevent her fromsaying of the 1993 Oslo accords, "Instead of glue, it's been sandpaper." Sheseemed to be siding with Yasser Arafat against Benjamin Netanyahu when she said1) the Palestinian Authority chief had done his best to improve security forIsraelis against Palestinian terrorism ("We have stated over and over againthat 100 percent effort [by Arafat's police] may not always bring 100 percenteffect") and 2) Netanyahu, despite admitted political difficulties at home, was"in a pretty strong position in his cabinet." But when asked if the UnitedStates was finally putting pressure on Israel, Albright replied, "It's not ourpolicy."            Themerger between Chrysler and Germany's Daimler-Benz led the front page of theFT and all German newspapers. In an editorial page analysis, theFT said that "without a successful merger of minds, the transactioncould rapidly turn sour." "Or as Janis Joplin put it in 'One Night Stand':'Just because we loved tonight, please don't think it's gonna stay that way,' "the FT concluded. LaStampa of Turin, Italy, home of Fiat, lauded the marriage as a "unionwithout conquest" and attributed this to the launch of the euro. "The singlecurrency is bringing the two shores of the Atlantic closer together," it said.Le Monde of Paris saidthe negotiations reflected the increased power of the German automobileindustry.            Italian newspapers all led on the fatal mudslides insouthern Italy, with the predictable comment that political incompetence waspartly responsible. But they also gave big play to the meeting in Washingtonbetween President Clinton and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, whodescribed their encounter as "a magic moment" in U.S.-Italian relations. ButEnnio Caretto, Washington correspondent of Corriere dellaSera of Milan, noted the president had inserted "a premeditated and cunningnote" into his condolences about the mudslides. Prodi said U.S. aid for thevictims would come from Aviano, the U.S. air base out of which an Americanplane recently sliced a ski-lift cable, killing 20 people and starting a waveof anti-Americanism in Italy.                           LeMonde led Thursday with the headline "Cancer: a Hope From America." Thesubject: Judah Folkman's encouraging experiments in Boston on mice. This was ahuge story around the world this week. France-Soir , the Paris eveningnewspaper, led by contrast with a story of a revolt by about 100 Frenchdentists against mercury fillings, which they claim to be dangerous. They areasking all their fellow dentists to sign an appeal against such fillings (eventhough, unfortunately, they are already in the teeth of around 30 millionFrench people).            In London Thursday, the EveningStandard led with the news that the dean of Westminster Abbey in London wasunder attack for giving money from TV companies to the Princess of WalesMemorial Fund when it should have been given to "the choristers of WestminsterAbbey Choir as a result of their participating in the Princess's funeralservice." The choirboys and their parents didn't receive any money in expenses,even though "a number of parents spent hundreds of pounds cutting shortholidays to return their sons to sing at the service, which was broadcast liveto hundreds of millions of viewers across the world," the newspaper said.            Amid growing hopes ofsuccess for the Ulster peace agreement, the Irish Independent of Dublinsaid in an editorial titled "Peace in their grasp" that "Tony Blair made anexcellent move when he invited his predecessor, John Major, to campaign withhim in Northern Ireland for a Yes vote in the May 22 referendum." "A unitedfront of the present and former British prime ministers must have a powerfulimpact," it said. Spanish newspapers led with a new Basque terrorist murder,El Pas reporting thisside by side with a report from Dublin about the IRA agreeing that itspolitical wing, Sinn Fein, might participate in an Ulster parliamentaryassembly.
