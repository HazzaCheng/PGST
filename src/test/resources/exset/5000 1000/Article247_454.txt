                                 Iraq and Roll Call            The Washington Post leads with U.S./U.N. reactions to thecontinuing Iraq stand-off. USA Today and the Los AngelesTimes lead with congressional fast-track maneuvering. And the New York Timesgoes with the announcement of a Pentagon job cut.            According to the WP , President Clinton is urging the U.N. to putenough pressure on Iraq to compel Saddam Hussein to give internal access onceagain to the U.N. weapons inspection teams. The Post says that Clintonis especially focused on getting France, Russia and Arab states to stay firm.Meanwhile, says the paper, Hussein made a statement on Iraqi television thatappeared to be bucking up his countrymen to continue the impasse.            The WP says Clinton is proceeding on two fronts. One, he is making itclear that military options are not off the table--"We will not," he saidyesterday, referring to Hussein's vow to shoot down U.S.-piloted U.N.surveillance U-2s, "tolerate his efforts to murder our pilots." And two, tryingto ensure that the U.N. maintains a united front against Iraq.                           USAT and the LAT both report that the fast-track roll callwill probably take place early Monday morning, and that Clinton seemed unableto persuade enough House Democrats to vote his way and so the emphasis hasturned towards the hunt for Republican votes. The LAT says Republicanleaders predict the bill will pass.            You have to sympathize a bit with the situation the dailies are in withfast-track. Fascinated by the bill's strange bedfellow coalition of supportersand convinced that a dramatic vote was imminent, the papers started hitchingtheir leads to the vote in the middle of last week, which meant that as thevote kept not materializing, the papers were stuck in bed with a story thatwouldn't undress and was ugly anyway. But the majors didn't help themselves outmuch--they could have been doing much more substantive reporting from theoutset about what sorts of trade agreements fast-track authority was likely tospawn. Why, for instance, is there no mention of NAFTA or GATT in thesestories? The whole episode is a good example of the press's weakness forcovering the how of a political story over the why or the what.            The NYT lead says that Secretary of Defense Cohen announced his planto cut thousands of administrative jobs at the Pentagon under pressure fromCongress to reduce the Pentagon's own bureaucracy before ordering cuts introops or weapons. The paper reports Cohen's plan could save $6 billion a year.(That's only a little more than a 2 percent cut.) The plan also includesproposed base closings, which the Times notes, require congressionalapproval and may not get it. And shades of the balanced budget deal, none ofthe projected pain takes place until Clinton is out of office. The WPruns substantially the same Cohen plan story on its front as well.            The Wall Street Journal runs a front-page feature about afederal affirmative action program for female highway contractors (the only onethat cites women as a disadvantaged class) and the backlash it has createdamong black, male construction workers, who feel squeezed out of the trade byit. Under the program, reports the Journal , women's share of federalhighway funds has tripled. But meanwhile, the share going to blacks, theprogram's original beneficiaries, plummeted. "The white women--95% of them arefronts," the WSJ quotes a black trucking business owner as saying. Nowthere's a move afoot in Congress to end the program, which the paper reports,might well mean a lot of female subcontractors will go bankrupt.            The WP runs a front-page piece detailing how since returning tooffice in 1995, Mayor Marion Barry has used more than $240,000 from a specialunaudited fund, generated by the D.C. hotel tax and political contributions,for such goodies as a Waterford crystal wedding gift, a lavish staff Christmasparty and extensive travel abroad. The story runs under the headline: "BarryUsed Unaudited Funds For Gift, Parties and Travel." That's F6 on Postkeyboards.
