                                 There Goes Chicago's Last Hope            As StephenSondheim might have said, when you're a bitch, you're a bitch all the way. Thegreat bitches of entertainment history understood this. They knew thatbitchiness must be both extreme and extremely meaningful, or it just comes offas unpleasant. Nineteen-fifties noir diva Gloria Graham, an actress with alittle-girl voice and bad-girl smarts, gave her quips an irresistiblecountercultural edge. Trash-mouthed Roseanne made everyone else look middlebrowby comparison. For the past two decades or so, All My Children's SusanLucci has waged a scorched-earth campaign against small-town feminine niceness.The producers of Chicago Hope had on their hands a bitch ofpotentially equal greatness, Christine Lahti's Dr. Kate Austin, and they neverlet her achieve it. She never got to be more than wishy-washy, insecure, a goodperson who went wrong and apologized and would really be a lot nicer if shejust got laid. A bitch without the courage of herconvictions.            If she was such a compromisedcharacter, why get upset about Lahti's not being asked back for the comingseason? After all, Barbara Hershey and Lauren Holly, hired more or less toreplace her, are powerful actresses. But you can't imagine either of theminspiring the following Lahti did--the cult of professional women who used tocall each other up and rage at the crap Kate Austin had to take every week. Tothem, this must seem like the final betrayal. Austin was a brilliant,sharp-tongued, and of course, being a bitch, somewhat manipulative heartsurgeon, but instead of enjoying the occasional triumph over her superciliouscolleagues, she just had more bad stuff happen to her than maybe anyone else innighttime soap history. Really bad stuff: Her father died. She lost herdaughter in a custody battle with an evil, power-mad husband (her own fault, ofcourse--she tried to tell the girl what to say in court). She kidnapped thegirl, got arrested, was fired, and then, when rehired, was forced to endure thehumiliation of being the best heart surgeon on staff with the least seniority.She put up with petty bad stuff too, like the constant carping of her malecolleagues about her lack of a gentle touch, or the punishments doled out bythe writers for her--a single mother--occasional forays into romance. When KateAustin went off for a little yoga-and-sex retreat with a colleague last year,for instance, her daughter wandered off into the winter night and nearly diedof hypothermia.            If we're talking betrayal, the realbetrayal was that Lahti didn't leave the series once the troubled ERclone started to abandon its blue-scrub realism for the creepy randomfancifulness that passes for creative on television these days. Here's an actress with a rare knack foremotional realism, the kind of intelligent, commanding presence that drainsreality from lesser co-stars. Cast her in a second-rate movie as the woman whosteals Ted Danson from his wife, Mary Tyler Moore, and suddenly you'rethinking, without mistresses, who'd ever realize the falseness of a falsemarriage? Cast her as a flaky ex-radical on the run from the government inRunning on Empty , and she comes off as the ultimate coolmother--competent under pressure, endlessly inventive, a fountain of love.Maybe the reason the writers saddled Kate Austin with so much misery was thatshe suffered more interestingly than anyone else on the show.            But the producers of ChicagoHope never managed to do anything more interesting with herinterestingness than cause her to aspire to leave medicine and become anastronaut, the ridiculous quest to which she devoted her last year on theseries. Workaholic Austin was a one-woman stress fiesta, a full-time mom, a15-hour-a-day doctor, a woman bumping her head constantly against the glassceiling. She was a woman ready to wreak some serious havoc. Let her loose andshe could have been, to say the least, memorable. Instead they tried to sendher into orbit. In space, presumably, no one could hear her scream.
