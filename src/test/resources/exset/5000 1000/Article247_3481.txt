                                 The Sorry State of International Disaster Relief            The Turkish earthquake of August 17 and its disastrously bungled reliefeffort--the official death toll now stands at 17,997 --is adepressingly familiar story. Why is the world unable to create an internationalforce to provide manpower and equipment to assist in the aftermath of hugenatural and manmade disasters (which seem to occur pretty reliably at leastfive or six times a year)? This extremely sensible idea was floated by theNew Republic , which attached to the hypothetical force the memorablename "Griefbusters," in a series of editorials from the mid-1980s to the early1990s. But for some mysterious reason, nobody seemed terribly interested.            According to an editorial in today's Christian Science Monitor , the United Nations is doing abetter job of coordinating the grab-bag of relief efforts, public and private,from all over the world, than it used to, thanks to its new Office for theCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which apparently took overmany duties of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator(UNDRO). UNDRO's record wasn't especially good. According to theMonitor , "the U.N. has learned from past attempts that its best role indisaster scenes is to pool the efforts of national governments, not to do thework itself." OCHA, says the Monitor , has a "realistic mandate." ButChatterbox isn't aware that the creation of a Griefbusters-type force has everbeen tried. Clearly, whatever small improvements the United Nations has made ininternational coordination didn't prevent the Turkish government from tellingmany foreign rescue workers to leave; even before 4-year-old Ismail Cimen waspulled out, alive, from under a collapsed balcony yesterday, German, Japanese,British, and Austrian rescuers had gone home. Meanwhile (according toyesterday's Toronto Globe and Mail ), a Canadian team of 200 soldiers wasbeing told by some Turkish officials that the field hospital andwater-purification systems it had brought were needed, and by other Turkishofficials that they were not. Exaggerated deference to an incompetent Turkishgovernment doesn't strike Chatterbox as the way to go.            The original New Republic Griefbusters editorial, published afterMexico City's disastrous 1985 earthquake, said:                                             A flexible rapid deployment force would report to a single director. Moreimportant, it would know what each kind of disaster called for, and wouldeither possess or have immediate access to the basic required equipment. Theforce could employ a semi-military structure, with reservists from membernations who could be called up at a moment's notice ... If we made a prioragreement with other nations, promising to help each other in case of disaster,the burden would be to refuse aid rather than to ask for it.                                       The editorial expressed a preference for limiting the disaster-relief forceto U.S. allies, working under U.S. control. In a later editorial, the NewRepublic proposed U.N. control, rightly pointing out that "howeverproblematic the U.N. remains politically, it ought to be able to function on ahumanitarian level." Either way is fine with Chatterbox.            The pathetic state of international disaster relief--arguably the UnitedNations is better at peacekeeping , which isn't saying much--calls tomind Lytton Strachey's description, in Eminent Victorians , of the anarchy with whichFlorence Nightingale was confronted when she set out to help wounded Britishsoldiers in Crimea. (As Strachey makes clear, Nightingale's fake "lady with thelamp" image as the mother of modern nursing completely obscures her realsignificance, which was as a ruthlessly effective administrative reformer,first of a single military hospital and later of the entire Britishmilitary-hospital system.) But in Nightingale's time, the British military atleast had the excuse that the age of modern medicine, with its emphasis onsterility and proper ventilation of hospital rooms, was only just dawning.What's our excuse?
