The South China Morning Post goesballistic, running an immense "Clinton in China" package. Adding to reams ofnews coverage, an analysis piece reports on the careful press manipulation ofthe president's tour. Clinton aides are relieved that a controversial ceremonyin Tiananmen Square will take place only after Friday's evening newscasts inthe United States, relegating it to less-watched weekend programs. The articlewonders if this was the result of dumb luck or devious engineering. A separateSCMP story illustrates the rampant Americanization Clinton willencounter in China. In addition to obvious infiltrators (McDonald's, Microsoft,Titanic ), the entire American "way of thinking" has invaded the country.President Jiang Zemin loves Elvis and FDR (both Clinton favorites); the centralbanking system is being modeled after the U.S. Federal Reserve; the judicialsystem is moving toward the American style; and the military is taking its cuesfrom West Point protocol. Still, leaders have warned against adopting Americanvalues--the "sugar-coated bullets of capitalism."            China Onlineposts the complete text of an article from People's Daily , the officialnewspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. The essay, written on the occasion ofClinton's visit, generally trumpets this summit as a positive step in warmingSino-U.S. relations. A few passages stand out, however:            As far as the Taiwan issueis concerned, the American leaders have time and again reiterated theirpromise: The United States persists in its one China policy ... does notsupport the view of 'one China, one Taiwan,' or 'two Chinas'; does not supportTaiwan independence; and does not support Taiwan to join the UnitedNations.            In theUnited States, the majority of people hope for Sino-U.S. friendly ties.However, a handful of people, who have a Cold War mentality, will spread rumorsand create trouble to obstruct and undermine Sino-U.S. relations onceopportunity arises. This definitely does not enjoy popular support.            Apair of essays in two different papers demonstratesconflict over the visit. In the Sydney Morning Herald, an editorial laughs at the notion that theUnited States could build a "strategic partnership" with China, which iscrumbling from within and is a poor country whose Communist leadership nolonger has the support of its people. We need not fear China, and Clintonshould press without compromise on human rights and political reform.Meanwhile, an editorial in the Free China Journal of Taiwan argues that China holds theupper hand in negotiations with the United States. Clinton's agreement toappear in Tiananmen Square marks a huge victory for Jiang, and the entire triphas been played according to Chinese terms. The piece quotes a U.S. official inAsia who predicts "Clinton's going to kowtow all over Peking."            The Buenos Aires Herald isall abuzz over a daring one-man invasion of the Malvinas Islands (known inBritain as the Falklands, site of a 10 week war that killed 1,000 militarypersonnel). An Argentine flew his twin-engine aircraft toward the islands in a"surprise" mission of peace. When he was picked up on British radar, a RoyalAir Force Tornado fighter jet intercepted him and forced him to land inMalvinas. "Apart from relatives of soldiers who were killed in the 1982 war,[the pilot] was the first Argentine to step onto the islands since theconflict." He was arrested as an illegal immigrant and immediatelydeported.            The Vancouver Sun reports inits lead story that Canadian logging companies and officials will vigorouslyfight the United States over stumpage rates. Canadians want lower stumpage sothey can compete. American loggers think lower stumpage will give Canadianfirms an unfair advantage. What's stumpage? "Stumpage is the fee per cubicmetre that government charges forest companies for the right to harvest timberon Crown land." And now you know.
