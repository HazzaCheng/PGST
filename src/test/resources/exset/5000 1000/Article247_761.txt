                                 Starr: Dwarf or Giant            USAT, the NYT and LAT lead with Kenneth Starr's testimony today before theHouse Judiciary Committee. The WP has two Starr stories on its front, but leadsinstead with the Republicans' House leadership elections, which garner bigfront space at the other papers. The only real news there is that J.C. Watts,the House's only black Republican, ascended to one of the party's top Houseposts.            Everybody stresses that Starr will claim that President Clinton's conduct inthe Lewinsky matter was part of a general pattern of misusing his office toprevent the dissemination of damaging information about him, but it's alsopointed out everywhere that his testimony will contain the first revelationthat Starr has exonerated President Clinton in the White House travel officefirings and in connection with the transferal of FBI background files to theWhite House. It's apparent from the accounts that the other major area ofalleged Clinton dissembling Starr has in mind is his original raisond'^tre , Whitewater, both in connection with Clinton's testimony at theArkansas trial of the McDougals and Jim Guy Tucker, and in the president'sapparent involvement in the channeling of funds to Webster Hubbell after thelatter's conviction. And the WP points out that Starr goes out of hisway to condemn Clinton for his encouragement, in a TV interview, of SusanMcDougal's continued silence. The LAT states most clearly the dimensionin which today's testimony is an advance over Starr's previous written report:that document spoke of possible grounds for impeachment, whereas according tothe LAT , Starr will say Clinton "should be removed from office."            All the papers write from advance copies of his prepared testimony madeavailable by Starr, and they all report that Clinton will be in Asia duringStarr's appearance. They also all mention that Clinton has not yet replied tothe 81 questions submitted to him by Judiciary chairman Hyde, pleading lack oftime given the Iraq crisis, but it's the WP that mentions in thisconnection that Clinton played golf on Monday. On the other hand, thePost also has a quote from Hyde in which he gives up the game of merelybeing a disinterested searcher for truth. Asked if Starr needed to hit a homerun today, Hyde is quoted: "I'd settle for a line drive over third."            The papers also mention that neither the White House nor committee Democratsare pleased that the time to question Starr has been limited, but none mentionsthat in his testimony before Starr's grand jury, Clinton likewise limited theamount of time he sat for questions.            A WSJ front-page feature depicts the interactions of a computer industryconsortium focused on keeping Microsoft at bay, the so-called NOISE group:Netscape, Oracle, IBM, Sun and Everybody else. The paper claims that in theservice of their goal, the companies have engaged in "cabal"-like behavior, andthat the fate of the alliance may affect the future of the software industryfar more than the outcome of the Microsoft anti-trust trial. The story statesthe Justice Department explanation of why such consorting is not an anti-trustissue the way it says Microsoft's activities are: "monopolies and theircompetitors play by different rules."            Ever wonder where, in a tickerless financial world, all that paper forticker tape parades come from? Well, today's Journal reports, in the"Business Bulletin," that for John Glenn's parade at least, some of the stuffwas a resume. No word on how the paper, er, pieced the story together.            There is a bunch of coverage today on the prospects for any internal,U.S.-supported overthrow of Saddam Hussein. A NYT front-pager describesU.S. officials as weary of the squabbling between ant-Hussein dissident groups,and says that at least one the U.S. is still funding is likely riddled withdouble agents. And a confluent NYT editorial concludes Hussein cannot beoverthrown without an American invasion and occupation. The LAT has afront-page effort that quotes a U.S. expert as saying the plan of one rebel isakin to the Bay of Pigs. The piece also includes this ringing assessment fromanother expert: "The only military skill [the Iraqi Kurds] have everdemonstrated is the ability to fight each other over smuggling rights."Apparently, there is no Kurdish Anti-Defamation League.
