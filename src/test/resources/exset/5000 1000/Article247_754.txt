                                 Temporary Husseinity            Everybody leads with the deployment of more U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf,as the Clinton administration--via remarks not just by President Clinton, butalso by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense WilliamCohen and Chairman of the JCS Gen. Hugh Shelton--once again warned SaddamHussein to accept weapons inspections or else. Yesterday's military moves:ordering stealth fighters and B-1 and B-52 bombers to the region along withanti-missile missiles and 3,000 Army troops. Another development that has inthe past served as an immediate warning of U.S. use of force: the withdrawal ofnonessential State Dept. personnel and their dependents from embassies (inIsrael and Kuwait), and of U.N. inspectors and humanitarian aid workers fromIraq. None of the papers mentions that such evacuations not only serve theobvious purpose, but also reduce Hussein's ability to deploy foreign "humanshields."            The New York Timespoints out that, unlike the previous go-round with Iraq last winter, neitherRussia nor France is currently attempting to find a diplomatic way out forHussein. But the Washington Post reports that in a closed-door meeting atthe U.N. yesterday, Russia continued to argue against using force. And USA Todaysays that Russia has been joined in this position by Egypt and SaudiArabia.            The Times says that the targets would be Iraq's weapons plants anddepots. The >WP 's columnist Jim Hoagland agrees and adds that theWhite House has prevailed over the Pentagon in insisting on a "substantial aircampaign." The Los Angeles Times passes along former Bush nationalsecurity advisor Brent Scowcroft's suggestion: take out one target a week,until Hussein grants inspections. But the paper points out current U.S.officials acknowledge that no bombing campaign, no matter how extensive, can beexpected to eradicate Hussein's covert weapons development efforts. TheNYT points out that neither the Gulf War nor subsequent strikes in 1993and 1996 significantly eroded Hussein's interest in or capability for weaponsdevelopment. And, adds the LAT , the U.S. is bedeviled by Hussein's wayof interpreting events--after all, he has told his citizens that the Gulf Warwas a great triumph for Iraq.            The NYT leads stresses in the first paragraph that the U.S. isprepared to strike with no further warning. How soon? Well, the Timesnotes that Madeleine Albright is planning to fly to an economic summit onFriday, not in her regular plane, but in a special airborne command and controlcraft known as the Doomsday Plane. The same plane, the paper reminds, she used whiletraveling last August just before U.S. cruise missile strikes into Afghanistanand Sudan.            The fronts at the LAT and NYT report that the Israeli cabinethas ratified the Wye pact with the Palestinian Authority. The Timesreports that the U.S. hailed the ratification as an important step, but bothpapers stress that the Cabinet salted its approval with enough conditionsrequiring specific prior actions by Yasser Arafat to produce at the very leastdelay if not an outright breakdown in the peace process.            An inside piece at the WP reports that a Communist member ofparliament, Albert Makashov, has called for quotas on the number of Jews in Russia and denounced atelevision correspondent as "worse than the worst of the yids." In a speech, healso told Boris Berezovsky, one of the nation's tycoons, "Don't behave as ayid." Makashov defended his use of the phrase by citing the writings ofPushkin, Dostoevsky and Gogol. The Post says anti-Semitism had been rarein post-Communist Russia before the country's economic swan dive lastAugust.            The Wall Street Journal reports that FAO Schwarz now offerssomething called "The Ultimate Sleep-Over Party" in which groups of kids can"camp out" in its stores for just $17,500. The paper further press releasesthat "some proceeds go to charity." It would be nice if the Journal madesure this item was more than just free advertising for the shi-shi toy store byfollowing up to see just how much of those 17K checks actually ends up going tothose in need.
