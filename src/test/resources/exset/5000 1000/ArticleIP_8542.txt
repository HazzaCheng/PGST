Randy'sWrap-Up                        There is akind of pseudo-rebelliousness when the ant mocks the elephant, particularlywhen the ant works for the elephant in some insect-sized capacity. But beforethings get overly Aesopian (too late for that, you old fool!) let me tell you astory about some real people. (Oh no, not another of his tedious stories!) Soyou kids stop doing that to the cat and listen closely. For months afterGeneral Electric bought NBC, David Letterman mocked his new bosses as "GEpinheads," and all the little ants who wrote for Dave felt sassy and bold. (Yousaid no animals!) A short time later, at the Late Night anniversaryparty, Jack Welch, the CEO of GE, and Robert Wright, the president of NBC,grinned and guffawed and slapped Dave on the back. "We love it when you call usGE pinheads!" said Welch. "We get such a kick out that!" said Wright. Davelooked embarrassed, as he so often does, for Welch and Wright had taught him alesson: When you mock them on television, you don't threaten them; you humanizethem. What sports! They can take a joke! It's the court jester lesson. And ifyou want to know more about it, stop by and talk to me down at the unemploymentoffice.
