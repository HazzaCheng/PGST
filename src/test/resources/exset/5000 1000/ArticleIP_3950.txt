                                             Anotherweek of just-short-of-armed-warfare in "The Fray." And the winners are ...                           HotThreads                        Testifying to just howmoribund the debate over Kenneth Starr's investigation has become, the regularcombatants in things political shuffled back to the "Politics '98" threadand ... welfare reform. One fraygrant's observation that "welfare folks receivea constellation of benefits" was torn limb from limb--after the gales oflaughter subsided, that is. The Internal Revenue Service's doings provoked somedebate and soon disintegrated into personal attacks among the fraygrants.            The"Religion"thread showcased the international flavor of the Fray this week. A missionaryin Africa and a fraygrant from India argued about the effects of missionaryactivity. And a participant from the Far East weighed in on Confucianism: Wasit really a religion, or was Confucius simply to Chinese morality what Platowas to Greek philosophy? The most interesting post of the week, however,emerged in a of the Crusades that took on a little-known tribe called theCathars and their 13 th century Inquisition.                           NewThreads                        What is the key to a lastingmarriage? Some choices proffered in the new "Marriage and Family"thread: friendship, mutual respect, honesty, humor, and variety. Where doesthis leave sex and children? One long-married fraygrant says, "We are still inlove, still fuck our brains out on a fairly frequent basis." Another's "basicpoint": "I don't think it's realistic to expect most relationships to besexually monogamous and to last a lifetime." A third offered a reason whypeople stay together: "Isn't it possible that a lot of long-lasting marriagesare long-lasting because of inertia created by the absence of alternatives tothat arrangement?" Most contributors agree that sex and children are desirablebut not necessary within the relationship; all agreed children should be theprimary consideration in cases of divorce.            Privacywas the topic this week in "Law and Order." Contributors--several of themlawyers--discussed an employer's right to drug test employees and thegovernment's right to monitor our lives. One particularly invoked GeorgeOrwell's 1984 . Other issues: child porn on the Net, on-the-scene news ontelevision, and whether parents who leave children to suffocate in a hot carshould be charged with manslaughter.                           GettingSerious                        William Faulkner's TheSound and the Fury remains the focus in the "Reading" thread. Thisweek's subject: the second of the book's four chapters, which is written fromthe viewpoint of Quentin, a tormented Harvard student who eventually killshimself. This week's burning questions: Was Quentin a classic suicide? Who wasthe father of Caddy's baby? Next week the Fray will take on the "Jason"chapter. Jump in, and examine the mind of a misanthrope.            The"Person of theCentury" thread hosted a humorous and articulate exchange on the importanceof M.K. Gandhi. Was he a "sheeted ascetic & do-gooder" or a "majorinfluence" on mass movements everywhere? In addition to this series of posts('s a sample), the thread also saw a spirited defense of Simone de Beauvoir("the Man of the Century is a woman") and Walt Disney (nominated in the culturesection of the ballot). Computer pioneers John Von Neumann and Alan Turing werealso mentioned--big surprise that their names should crop up in an Internetforum. First-roundvoting closes today, May 6, and                   Slate                subscribers should votewhile they can.                           Post ofthe Week                        Aninteresting exchange in the new "Marriage and Family" thread on what a marriageis all about inspired one veteran fraygrant to his thoughts on some of theunexpected benefits of marriage.
