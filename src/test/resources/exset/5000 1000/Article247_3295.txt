                                 Weatherbox            Although Chatterbox regards                   Slate                as a near-flawless source ofnews and commentary, it does tend to neglect an important aspect of life: theweather. Not once has                   Slate                ever run the headline, "Whew!It's a Scorcher!" or posted, in the middle of a cold-weather snap, a photographof a Florida orange covered with frost. (Incidentally, Chatterbox has longsuspected the AP keeps on file a single photograph of a frost-covered orangeand uses it every year. How would anyone know the difference?)            These thoughts are inspired by the current miserable heat wave. It's ascorcher! According to USA Today , America's newspaper of record on the subjectof weather, it's supposed to be upward of 100 degrees today on the Great Plainsand in parts of the southeast and southwest. (Click herefor USA Today 's incomprehensible-but-gripping "radar movie" of thecontinental United States.) As the century draws to a close, "hottest summer"records are being broken left and right, making it harder and harder topooh-pooh evidence that greenhouse gasses are warming the planet. However,Chatterbox isn't really interested today in expounding on the terrifying menaceof global warming. (It's too hot.) Instead, Chatterbox finds himself wondering:How hot can it get? As is usually the case when interesting questions areraised, the answer can be found on the Web--in this case, by consulting theNationalClimatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(popularly known as NOAA and pronounced exactly like Chatterbox's lastname).            Chatterbox has always felt that the usual way temperature records areexpressed--by comparing today's temperature in Topeka to the temperature inTopeka on this same exact day in previous years--is a bit of a cheat.With 365 days in a year, and a limited database of temperatures recorded inTopeka during previous years, you've got a pretty decent chance of breakingweather records pretty frequently. No doubt there are serious scientificreasons for recording all-time temperature highs this way, but a nonscientificreason may be that it makes it easier for weather authorities to soothe anaggrieved public: There, there. You're right. Nobody's ever had to endurewhat you're enduring today . But Chatterbox wants to know: What's thehottest it's ever been, anywhere ?            According to NOAA, the hottest it's ever been, anywhere on Earth, at least asfar as we know, was 136 degrees Fahrenheit. That was the temperature recordedin El Azizia, Libya, on Sept. 13, 1922. The second-hottest it's everbeen, anywhere, was right here in the United States, when it hit 134 degrees atthe Greenland Ranch in Death Valley, Calif., on July 10, 1913. Thethird-hottest it's ever been, anywhere, was in Tirat Tsvi, in what wouldsoon be Israel: 129 degrees on June 21, 1942. (The coldest it's everbeen, anywhere, interestingly, was recorded in July--July 23, 1983--when it hitminus 129 degrees in Vostok, Antarctica.)            NOAA also has hottest-ever data for America-firsters who only really careabout how hot it gets in the U.S. (On the "Temperature Extremes" page, go to "All-Time Temperature Maximumsby State" and click on "Table [PDF].") As previously stated, the hottest day inthe U.S. was July 10, 1913, when it hit 134 degrees in Death Valley, Calif. Thesecond-hottest day in the U.S. was June 29, 1994, when it hit 128degrees in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and 125 degrees Fahrenheit (thethird-highest temperature ever recorded in the U.S.) in Laughlin, Nev. Thethird-hottest day in the U.S. was June 27, 1994--presumably the sameheat wave--when it hit 122 degrees in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in NewMexico. (Chatterbox assumes the temperature had nothing to do with theradioactivity of the WIPP's contents.) The second-hottest and third-hottestrecords would seem to support the theory that global warming is making theplanet, or at least the United States, much hotter.            Probably the data isn't perfect. Can it really be true that the hottesttemperature ever recorded in Hawaii was 100 degrees (on April 27, 1931)?Chatterbox has never been to Hawaii but was under the impression it had a warmclimate. Chatterbox would also like to take this opportunity to implore pedantsnot to write in and point out that during earlier geological eras the worldwideclimate was vastly different from what it's been during the last century (whichis about as far back as record-keeping goes). Still, the NOAA statistics doseem to show that, hot as it is, we should all stop bitching and get back towork. It's been hotter.
