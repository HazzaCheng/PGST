                                 Kofi Break?            The late Sunday movement in the Iraq crisis is everybody's lead. USA Todaysays that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will arrive in New York today fromBaghdad, bringing with him an agreement that may avert a second Gulf War. TheLosAngeles Times reports the breakthrough came via a dramatic, three-hourbargaining session between Annan and Saddam Hussein. The Washington Post says Annan will present the document he andHussein already signed Monday (Baghdad time) to the Security Council in NewYork on Tuesday. Written details were not available at press time (andUSAT notes that U.S. officials aren't sure that Annan could speakfrankly about it to anyone while he remained in Iraq where phone lines are notsecure), but the dailies are reporting that Hussein has agreed to open hispresidential palaces to U.N. weapons inspectors--the sticking point that hasbrought the U.S. to the brink of warfare. More than the other papers, theNew York Timesemphasizes that much seems to remain unresolved for the moment--the number ofsites covered may actually be limited, it reports.            According to the coverage, the newly brokered agreement lacks something theIraqis had previously insisted on--a time limit on inspections of thepresidential locations. And in return, the U.N. agrees to provide diplomatsfrom various countries who would accompany the weapons inspectors. Even if theSecurity Council approves the deal, notes the WP , Washington hasreserved the right to bomb Iraq. And White House spokesman Mike McCurry iswidely quoted as noncommittal. But, says the Post , Annan is confidentthat all members of the Council, including the U.S., will accept the deal. Oneadministration concern the Post passes along: that Annan may not haveinsisted on the right of inspectors to make repeat visits to the presidentialpalaces.            The NYT emphasizes that the agreement apparently does not address theissue of other presidential properties not on Baghdad's list of eight. TheTimes national edition reports that "some diplomats say" that in only amatter of weeks inspectors could run into access problems at other sites. TheNYT metro edition is bolder: "The agreementapparently does not address the issue of other presidential properties notamong the eight listed by Baghdad." The USAT frontsection cover story">USAT front section cover story is plainerstill: "The problem is that over the years, Saddam has also agreed to manythings on which he has not followed through."                           USAT goes front-page with the news from Sunday morning chat showappearances made by Monica Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, that she"absolutely" stands by her affidavit in which she denied having sex withPresident Clinton. Only USAT sees this as big news. The other frontspass, perhaps because, as USAT notes, Ginsburg has said almost as muchbefore.            The Wall Street Journal waited until the day after Desert Stormopened fire to run its profile of Norman Schwarzkopf. Today, it does a littlebetter in running an interesting Thomas Ricks profile of the current Iraqioperation's top dog, Gen. Anthony Zinni. It seems to "Today's Papers" that suchmen should get at least as much advance press attention as second-tierpresidential candidates do. (How many column inches, for instance, did theJournal spill on Alan Keyes?) The piece has the good detail that whenZinni headed up peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, he met regularly with localcartoonists, who he discovered, had inordinate influence on the largelyilliterate local populace. The piece's only real false-step: describing theMarine Corps' ideal officer as a "knuckle-dragging intellectual." Would theJournal ever call a CEO that?            A front-page NYT piece notes the trend towards Internet-aided prostitution operations. TP doesn't know theNYT policy regarding the giving of Web addresses in news stories, butnotes that in this one, the address for a Chelsea-based sex serviceclearinghouse called "Redlightnet.com" is not issued. But what's the point ofwithholding this, since a Web search of that handle will quickly turn up aURL?
