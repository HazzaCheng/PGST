                                 More Than Monica            On New Year's Eve, theGuardian ofLondon published a survey of last year's media agendas from countries aroundthe world. Headlined "1998: More than just Monica," it highlighted the newspriorities that prevailed in different countries during the period. In China,for example, the big story had been the Chinese government's self-proclaimeddiplomatic triumphs, such as President Clinton's visit to Beijing and ChinesePresident Jiang Zemin's visits to Moscow and Tokyo; in Russia it had been thecollapse of the post-Soviet financial system and the humiliation of marketreformers; in Israel the disintegration of Benjamin Netanyahu's government amidbitter divisions over the Middle East peace process; in South Africa the reportof the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on apartheid-era crimes; in Germanythe September election that ousted Chancellor Helmut Kohl and brought theSocial Democrat Gerhard Schrder to power; in Italy the country's success inqualifying to join the new euro currency; and in France its soccer team's 3-0victory over Brazil in the final of the World Cup.            But if 1998 involved"more than just Monica," it was also certainly Monica's year. Hers was a story,which, more than any other, united all the papers of the world in a commonobsession. However, there was widespread reluctance around the world this weekto report the allegations in the American tabloids that President Clinton maybe the father of the teen-age son of an Arkansas prostitute. Only in Britaindid the story play prominently. The Times even led its Monday front page with it, underthe headline "Clinton faces DNA test on prostitute's son, 13." In Germany, thepress showed more responsible news priorities, with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungleading Monday with Clinton announcing the biggest increase in defense spendingsince the end of the Cold War.            But the biggest story around the world as the week beganwas the launch by 11 countries of the new single European currency, the euro.The reporting of this event in Europe was imbued with euro-euphoria except inBritain, where euro-skepticism continues to predominate. All Rupert Murdoch'sBritish papers--the Times , the Sunday Times , the Sun , andthe News of the World --are campaigning vigorously against Britainjoining the euro, as are Conrad Black's papers the Daily Telegraph andthe Sunday Telegraph . But even the British press had to agree with therest of the world that the launch of the euro, after 40 years of planning, wasan historic achievement.            It was especiallywelcomed outside Europe in countries yearning for an alternative to dependenceon the U.S. dollar. For example, in Havana the weekly Juventud Rebeldeannounced that Cuba would be the first country in the region to substitute theeuro for the dollar in its foreign commercial transactions. From January 2000,it said, Cuban companies would be obliged to use the euro for their trade withChina, Vietnam, and North Korea. Granma , the Cuban Communist Party daily, described the euroas a force for "tranquility and stability" and "a challenge to the economic andfinancial hegemony of the United States."            In India, the Hindu devoted its main editorial Monday to the euro under the headline "An epochalexperiment." It said that the euro could benefit developing countries bymounting an effective challenge to the dollar. "The global preference for thedollar as a reserve currency has not only meant that the U.S. has had access toinexpensive funds but also that the rest of the world effectively finances itschronic account deficit," the Hindu concluded. In Singapore, theStraitsTimes led its front page Monday with a story anticipating that the eurowould boost the value of Asian currencies against the dollar.            Among various hyperboliceditorials in the European press, Le Monde of Paris appealed Tuesday to a reluctant Britain to overcome its fearsabout loss of sovereignty and to join the single currency. "Englishmen," theeditorial began, "it's now your turn to play! The euro awaits you, Europe andits infant currency need you." It continued, "Your country's participation inthe euro is also, for us Frenchmen, a necessity. ... The euro needs Europe'sdiversity--to be neither a clone of the deutsche mark nor a Siamese twin of theItalian lira. The support of your culture--of your pragmatism and your distrustof bureaucracy, etc.--is indispensable to the stability and solidity of theeuro. With you present, the euro is more likely to become one of the greatinternational currencies. As an ancient superpower, you know the advantages wecan all draw from that."
