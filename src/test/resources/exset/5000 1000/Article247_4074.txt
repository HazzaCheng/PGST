                                 Impresario Gates                        Dear Gerald:            We're probably more in accord on Africana than not, but I think youwere too easy on Gates. Years ago, before blackness became really marketable,it used to be said that the publishing industry would admit only one blackwriter at a time. Langston Hughes was succeeded by Richard Wright, who in turnwas succeeded by James Baldwin. A few years ago, we thought that notion wasdisproved when Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, and Terry McMillan weresimultaneously on the bestseller list. Then along came Henry Louis "Skip" GatesJr.            He's the modern-day impresario of black culture, the Joyce Carol Oates ofblack studies, producing with daunting regularity. James Brown used to becalled the hardest-working man in show business, but he ain't got nothing onGates.            Would somebody puh-leeze stop him before he writes again?            Unlike you, I don't labor in the fields of black culture, and I'mglad--though as a fiction writer who keeps hearing rumors that Gates is workingon a novel, I'm constantly checking my rear-view mirror for his headlights. Youguys are in an unenviable place. Gates must seem like he's everywhere. Stilland all, I wonder how much of his work will survive, and whether, in a hundredyears, say, anyone will read anything by Gates, in the same way we still readThe Souls of Black Folk .            Oh, well. At least Gates had the decency not to include himself in his ownencyclopedia. Or did I miss that entry?            I wish he'd left out bell hooks and Cornel West, though, two prominentpublic intellectuals (that's what they call people who get paid hundreds ofthousands of dollars to lecture the rest of us about what we're doing wrong).There are biographies of both, though, thankfully, we only have to readabout hooks. Not so with West. He writes a 15-page "interpretation" ofW.E.B. Du Bois. (I think what "interpretation" really means is that, likeGates, West wants to be Du Bois when he grows up.) But why West and not DavidLevering Lewis? Lewis is an award-winning historian (not a preacher manqu),and though only one volume has been published, his is already the standardbiography of Du Bois.            I suppose the explanation is that when you get to be HNIC, as Gates has, youreward your friends and ignore everyone else. Which would explain why there'snothing here on Ward Connerly, Stanley Crouch, Glenn Loury, or Thomas Sowell. Icouldn't even find anything on black conservatism.            Of course, I'd rather have Africana than not, but did they have to beso slavishly politically correct and populist? There are at least threearticles on homosexuality, including one titled "Homosexuality in Africa: AnInterpretation" (there's that word again!), and the popularization begins onthe box with a blurb from Michael Jordan. (And I thought he was just abasketball player and TV huckster.)            There's an entry on rap music (what an oxymoron!). I suppose you could makean argument that it's a significant enough phenomenon, so that it deserves tobe here. But what's the rationale for separate biographical entries on QueenLatifah, Snoop Doggy Dog, Tupac Shakur, and a host of other dubious thugs? Andwhat about Rupaul? Why is he here? I thought he'd already used up his 15minutes of fame.            And what would Du Bois have made of that ?            You think black studies has achieved middlebrow status. I'm less sanguinethat many whites feel bad when they don't know something about black historyand culture. Years ago, a white woman told me about how her son's teacher letthe class dance to a Michael Jackson record for 10 minutes to celebrate BlackHistory Month. And I wonder whether the choice of reviewers here--we're bothblack--doesn't say something that makes me uncomfortable and, well, a littlebit angry.            We'll be closer when we have two white reviewers, or a Korean and a Jew.Black history--in America, at least--is American history. There ought to beroom in the retelling of it for the letters Mark Twain and Frederick Douglassexchanged, for the similarities between Invisible Man and Ben Franklin'sAutobiography , for the presence of Charles Chesnutt at the banquet tohonor Twain shortly before the latter's death, and for the monument inMississippi to the slaves who rode with a band of Confederate irregulars.            Sadly, I don't find that here,David
