What is thisprogram called?

Randy's Wrap-Up                        The admonition, "Youbecome what you behold," has yielded to "You become what you belittle." WeAmericans mocked the militarism of German youth in the '30s, and now we'reembracing Louis Caldera's ballistic schemes. In the '50s, we taunted the clunkycars of the U.S.S.R. for their farm-wagon squareness; now we drive cool SUVs.The joys of deriding portly Austrian burghers in the '60s haven't prevented usfrom becoming a nation of American fatties. Nor has the fun we all had sneeringat England's squandering its North Sea oil windfall in the '70s and '80s keptthe Republican Party from proposing to give away the budget surplus to theirrich constituents. The frightening conclusion, if mockery precedes mimicry, isthat any minute now we'll all be working for Tina Brown.                           Lock and LoadAnswer                        The program is the Junior Reserve Officer TrainingCorps.            To meet what it calls a growing demand from highschools, the Army will double its JROTC by the 2000-2001 academic year, addingit to 50 more high schools in 18 states, for a total of 1,420. After that, 50more schools will be added annually for the next five years. There were 230,000kids in the program last year. The Army will supply various pieces ofequipment, including guns for the kids' marksmanship training.            Taught by retired Armyguys, JROTC courses cover history, current events, technology, communications,physical fitness, and the ever popular shooting. Militaristic? You bet! But thegood kind of militaristic. "By expanding the JROTC, the Army is broadening itsinvestment in America's young people through a program that emphasizes thevalues that have made our country great," says Caldera. "Insert your own darkjoke about those values," he did not add.
