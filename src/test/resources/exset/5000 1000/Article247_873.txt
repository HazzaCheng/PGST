                                 Can America Stand Pat?                           USAToday and the Los Angeles Times lead with a special Senate committee'sreport on the Y2K problem. (The report was first discussed last week in theWashington Post , which today runs a story on itinside, as does the New YorkTimes .) The top non-local story at the WP is the consummation ofthe long-awaited deal by which the federal government and the state ofCalifornia have agreed to pay a lumber company $480 million to preserveNorthern California's Headwaters Forest, which had been the largest stand ofancient redwoods in private hands. This also makes the LAT front. TheNYT fronts Headwaters too, but leads instead with growing support inCongress for walling off Social Security funds from the rest of the federalbudget. The main divide among advocates of the move, the story explains, isbetween those who want to do it now and those who want to do it gradually.Yesterday, House Republicans introduced a gradual plan. Gradualism has theadvantage of allowing for a combination of new spending and tax cuts near-termand shoring up Social Security in the long haul. The story delays until the13th paragraph the news that all current talk of budget surpluses depends oncounting Social Security among general revenues, and never mentions that inbusiness accounting, earmarked pension funds are not considered among a firm'sassets.            The subhead over USAT 's Y2K story says the Senate report "citesvulnerability but little risk of disaster" and the story proper quicklyincludes calming words from two senators. Nonetheless mentioned are potentialproblems with paychecks and medical records, and accidental nuclear launches.The LAT lead stresses the risks a bit more, with its first paragraphmentioning computer crashes, disruptions leading to civil unrest in somecountries, and the risk of terrorist attacks amid the resulting confusion.USAT plays terrorism lower. Both papers make the point that whatever Y2Krisks there are will be more acute in many foreign countries than in theU.S.            The NYT off-lead reports the murder of eight tourists visiting the Bwindi Impenetrable Forestin Uganda to see rare mountain gorillas. The story also makes the LATand WP fronts. The two Americans among the dead were executives atIntel. The murderers were said to be a band of machete-wielding Hutu rebels,remnants of the forces that massacred more than half a million rival Tutsitribesmen and moderate Hutu in Rwanda in 1994. The Times notes thattourist treks aiming to see mountain gorillas became popular after the movie"Gorillas in the Mist," about researcher Dian Fossey, but oddly does notmention that Fossey was also murdered in the jungle.            The WP goes above the fold with a picture for Pat Buchanan's decisionto run for president for a third time. In New Hampshire, Buchanan, the paperreports, launched his effort with a speech criticizing economic globalism, theUN, immigration, affirmative action and abortion. His peroration was "As theysay, mount up and ride to the sound of the guns."            The Wall Street Journal "Tax Report" informs that the new IRScapability to accept tax payments via credit card has become unexpectedlypopular among the super-wealthy. Already, says the paper, at least seventaxpayers have asked to charge between $1 million and $9 million on their Amexor MasterCard. And at least 20 have asked to charge more than $100,000. Can youguess why? Well, the Journal points out, charging $4 million could rackup enough frequent flier miles to buy 40 friends first-class round trip ticketsto London.            The claws are out and the fur is flying as the Monica show, (during which,reports the WP , Lewinsky says President Clinton is a "good kisser" who"struggles with his sensuality") opens tonight. The LAT front quotes acommentator saying, "This country's appetite for the salacious, the sexy andthe personal is truly a bottomless pit...." The commentator? Lucianne Goldberg,who goes on to say, "Most pudgy little princesses from California don't getthemselves into this kind of a jam and make all this money." Publisher and TVhost Judith Regan says Lewinsky "isn't a victim. She's an adulterer and sheshould be walking around with a scarlet A." And she "seemed more interested inmaking money than contemplating the deep meaning of her actions." TheLAT notes that Regan tried and failed to land the Lewinsky book, butdidn't mention that Regan's commitment to asceticism and deep contemplationincluded publishing Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern.
