                                 Ain't It Grand?                           USAToday , the New York Timesand LosAngeles Times lead with President Clinton's unprecedented grand juryappearance today. The Washington Post shows it knows its way beyond the Beltway,putting Clinton/grand jury as the off-lead and going instead with the news thata suspect has been detained in the Kenya embassy bombing, a story that makeseverybody's front page. (Although, in its version of the story, USATcuriously leaves the arrest out of the headline, which instead trumpets theState Dept.'s warning against travel to Pakistan.)            The big concern of the Clinton leads is, of course, What will he say? Allthe papers cite widespread indications that he is ready to acknowledge that heengaged in some sort of sexual activity with Monica Lewinsky. The LATquotes presidential private lawyer David Kendall as saying that the widelyreported prediction that Clinton will cop to an "inappropriate relationship"with Lewinsky--is "groundless speculation." But the LAT quotes one"lawyer familiar with the matter" as saying that this is indeed the phrase he'sheard mentioned by "folks at the White House." The WP quotes sources whohave spoken to Clinton and his lawyers as saying he plans to admit to "sex play," but (taking the line first adumbrated by lastFriday's NYT ) not to a "sexual relationship." The Post comparesthis tack to such previous Clinton hair-splits as his various explanations ofhis marijuana use, his draft situation, and those White House coffees forpolitical donors.            The papers say that Clinton is expected to deny that he asked Lewinsky oranyone else to cover up the relationship. The LAT quotes thatwell-connected lawyer as saying that Starr may come armed with a subpoena inhis pocket for Clinton--who technically is appearing today voluntarily--in caseClinton tries to duck any of the prosecutors' questions. The NYT givesan excellent feel for the difficulties such questions might pose, ticking offdetails challenging various previous Clinton statements, garnered from thegrand jury appearances of Betty Currie, Vernon Jordan and Secret Servicepersonnel.            The papers quote presidential sources as saying that if Clinton makes anysort of post-testimony public statement, it will come from his private quartersin the White House, not the Oval Office.            The Wall Street Journal dedicates a front-page feature to thequestion of how history will judge Clinton in light of his aspirations, hisaccomplishments and his scandals. The piece quotes one writer's hesitance tochange his rating of Clinton for the paperback version of his book, going topress soon. His explanation for holding off: "The jury is still out...."            The WP lead reports that an Arab man arrested by Pakistan authorities the day of theKenya bombing, because of his presentation of a questionable passport after hecame off a flight from Nairobi, has acknowledged "calmly and proudly" being amember of the seven-man team that pulled off the Nairobi embassy attack. What'smore, according to the Post the man says the team was put together andfinanced by the leading suspect, Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden. (TheNYT says merely that the man is suspected of being a bin Laden associateor supporter.) According to the WP , the man is now in U.S. custody. TheLAT says he's in Kenyan custody. The Post reports he says theother six bombers slipped by authorities at the Karachi airport. And, thepapers note, bin Laden is ensconced in Afghanistan.            The NYT off-lead reports that U.S. intelligence agencies havedetected a huge underground complex in North Korea that seems to bedesigned for the secret resumption of the country's nuclear weapons program,officially frozen by the North Koreans in return for the promise of billions inWestern aid.            A NYT op-ed by former Sen. Larry Pressler gives a damning insightinto the contemporary political mind. The point of the piece is for the authorto rue the state of contemporary politics from the perspective of one suddenlyremoved from it by an election loss, but what he mostly communicates instead isthat he loves his newfound ability to: take more and better vacations, to be astar panelist (on "losers") at a Rennaissance Weekend, and to fly first classand buy a Japanese motorcycle and take free trips from corporations withouthaving to explain himself.
