Monday's question (No.161)--"Rapoportable":                                                                                                      Jacques Rapoport led the search for something"that was sweet rather than violent, that lingered for two weeks, and thatsuggested a feeling of cleanliness and well-being rather than of filthinessbeing covered up." What was Rapoport lookingfor?

Randy's Wrap-Up                        It's a tough position for New Yorkers(as many of you are) to be put in--invited to joke about scents andsensibilities. How can you gain the moral high ground, that lofty crag fromwhich to hurl down scorn, when your native city--what's theword?--stinks.            The best tactic for a situation tainted by your ownimperfection is to define yourself as the happy medium, superior to those onboth your left and right. Thus, cleaner than we are and they're prigs (like theSwiss); dirtier than we are and they're pigs (like the French). Or as BobLivingston explains it, my history of adultery is only human (more human thanthat of those unsinning prigs, my critics), and I confessed to everything themoment I was sure I'd been found out (unlike our perjuring, porcinepresident).            Fouler even than the odor of contemporary Washingtonor Paris or New York was that of 18 th century anywhere. Late in theevening of Aug. 14, 1773, James Boswell welcomed to his home city his greatfriend. "Mr. Johnson and I walked arm-in-arm up the High Street to my house inJames's Court; it was a dusky night; I could not prevent his being assailed bythe evening effluvia of Edinburgh. A zealous Scotsman would have wished Mr.Johnson to be without one of his five senses upon this occasion. As we marchedslowly along, he grumbled in my ear, 'I smell you in the dark!' "            Look for that phrase atthe impeachment trial.                           Olfactory WorkerAnswer                        As BethSherman and others knew, Rapoport was seeking a perfume to nasally improve theParis metro. After screening 500 scents, his team selected a fragrance theynamed "Madeleine," after Paris' most noisome station. Each month, a ton and ahalf of it will be added to the cleaning products used throughout the subwaysystem.
