MultipleThumbs Down                        Jacob Weisberg furtherdamages his case in hisreply to my recent letter to the editor. Responding to my suggestions thathe uses selective quotation and inadequate research, he writes, "Siskel gaveArmageddon a 'thumbs up' and named it his 'flick of the week' onSneak Previews ."            Siskel did indeed give thefilm a "marginal thumbs up"--hardly "cringe-making praise." Otherwise,Weisberg's sloppy homework is again on display. Siskel named it his "Flick ofthe Week" not on television but in the Chicago Tribune , where he reviewsone film a week at length. (Siskel's review is here.) If Weisberg had clicked on a couple of samples, hewould have learned that the "Flick of the Week" is not an endorsement and canbe a positive or a negative review; the current "Flick of the Week" gets onlytwo stars. We have not appeared on a program named Sneak Previews since1982, which may offer a clue as to how carefully Weisberg watches Siskel& Ebert while forming his opinions.            I note hedoes not reply to my observation that most of the critics he mentions havegiven negative reviews to most of the films he says we praised.            -- Roger EbertChicagoSun-Times Chicago                           Awww,Shucks                        In"Flytrap's Trashy Books," David Plotz says William Bennett is guiltyof false modesty. This called to mind a remark of the English playwright AlanBennett (no relation, I think): "All modesty is false. Otherwise it's notmodesty."            -- Adam Liptak NewYork City                           A JobWell Done Is Its Own Reward                        In "Privatize theIndependent Counsel!" Steven E. Landsburg suggests, somewhat tongue incheek, that we allow the president of the United States, after he leavesoffice, "to sell 10,000 U.S. citizenships to the bidders of his choice. ... Ifhe does a better job, those citizenships will become more valuable, and he'llget a better price for them."            This, he contends, willencourage the president to do a good job.            Earlier in the column,however, he exposes the flaw in this idea. Landsburg notes, "What if he [thepresident] keeps us out of war through policies that make the world moredangerous for our children?"            Indeed, what if thepresident makes the world (including the United States) a more dangerous place,but the United States remains a safer place relative to the rest of theworld? Even though the United States would be safer than other places, and thusU.S. citizenship would be more valuable, it would still be, in absolute terms,more dangerous than it was.            Really,we already reward the president for doing a good job--we reserve a place forhim in history. Presidents who do a good job are remembered favorably; thosewho do not are not. This is not always true, of course. Sometimes when apresident does a terrible job we just name an airport after him.            -- RichGoldberg Silver Spring, Md.                           StevenE. Landsburg responds:                                       Touch, Mr. Goldberg.The plan I proposed not only gives the president an incentive to make theUnited States better, it also gives him an incentive to make the rest of theworld worse. So I should not have proposed it. After all, we wouldn't want todeter future presidents from emulating great achievements like, say, freeingEurope from Communism.                                       FlytrapClaptrap                        After a promising beginning,                  Slate                has degenerated into a ridiculous mess of sixthhandrehashing of the Lewinsky scandal. It has been weeks since I've seen asubstantive and interesting article posted. How about stopping publishing somuch of this drivel and hiring people to write intelligent, interesting work onsome (any!) other topic?            If                  Slate                continues in anything like its present form, I certainlywon't be renewing my subscription. You'll continue to have an audience ofClinton-hating Lewinsky junkies, but as years go on I don't think this is aviable business model.            -- Peter Woit NewYork City                           Addressyour e-mail to the editors to letters@slate.com.
