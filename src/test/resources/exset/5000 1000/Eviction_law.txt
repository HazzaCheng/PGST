Eviction law is fine with local tenantWednesday, February 20, 2002By Ted RoelofsAs a husband, father and tenant of a Grand Rapids public housingcomplex, Aubrey Robertson puts security at the top of his homepriority list.Because of that, Robertson is all for a zero-tolerance drug lawin force at Creston Plaza apartments on Grand Rapids' NortheastSide.That includes cases in which families may be evicted for thedrug use of a single family member, even off the premises.Robertson sees it as a tool to keep his complex as clean and safeas possible."If there's one person (using drugs), that is a start," saidRobertson, 52, a native of Jamaica.He has lived the past four years at Creston Plaza with his wife,Tammy, and his daughter, Precious, 3. In recent months, Robertsonwas pleased to see casual drug use at the complex diminish with theinstallation of security cameras."If there is a start, then there will be some other problem. Itotally agree (if there is a drug link), get them out."Critics say the law -- argued Tuesday before the U.S. SupremeCourt -- tramples on individual rights and harms the very peoplepublic housing authorities are supposed to help."It's basically one strike and you're out, and I think they wentbeyond what Congress intended," said Michael Chielens, executivedirector of Western Michigan Legal Services."Someone who had no knowledge or involvement in a criminal actis being punished. That's kind of a basic due process notion thatwe have had in our legal tradition for a long time."The case was brought by four Oakland, Calif., senior citizens,including 63-year-old great-grandmother Pearlie Rucker. Theyreceived eviction notices because of the drug use of relatives orcaregivers.Rucker was ordered out because her mentally disabled daughterwas caught with cocaine three blocks from the apartment she sharedwith her mother and other family members, court records show.An appeals court blocked enforcement of the law.At issue is whether housing directors are being more aggressivethan Congress intended. The law was passed in 1988 and endorsed bythe Clinton administration in 1996 and by the Bush administrationlast year.The law was written at a time when public housing complexes wereunder assault by drug-dealing gangs and politicians were pressuredto take action.Families can be removed for drug use by one member, whether thedrug activity is in the home or somewhere else.Under the Department of Housing and Urban Development'enforcement program, tenants may not avoid eviction simply byclaiming ignorance of the crime or an inability to stop it.Carlos Sanchez, executive director of the Grand Rapids HousingCommission, believes the law can be effective if it's applied withdiscretion.The commission administers about 3,500 public housing units inthe Grand Rapids area, including Creston Plaza."I think if it's done with caution, it's a tool that wedesperately needed in our developments," Sanchez said.Sanchez said Grand Rapids doesn't have the large-scale drugproblems larger cities do -- and he wants to keep it that way."We've done the best we can to keep it from being sodrug-infested it becomes a war zone. Once the development is takenover, it's very difficult to take them back."Sanchez said the commission relies on police reports in decidingevictions, which he estimated at one or two a year.Among those cases, according to Leslie Curry, litigationdirector of Western Michigan Legal Services, was that of a motherevicted from public housing about a year ago with several youngchildren.She was removed because her 17-year-old son was arrested sellingdrugs outside the apartment, Curry said. That left her with thehardship of seeking a place she could afford for herself and herchildren, without the certainty she afford the rent."She didn't know about it," Curry said of the drug deal."In Grand Rapids, subsidized housing is critical to people'sability to maintain basic security in their lives."
