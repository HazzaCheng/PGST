                                 Blow Book Blows            The Washington Post leads with a Russian rocket attack onGrozny, the capital of Chechnya, that killed more than 100 people--mostlycivilians--and wounded several hundred more. The assault is also the topnonlocal story at the Los Angeles Times . It is carried inside elsewhere. TheLAT leads with news that the Los Angeles police scandal is mushrooming,based on a reporter's unadvertised attendance at a special briefing for LAPDofficers at which they were told that investigators are now looking into sevenquestionable shootings of Angelenos, and into the police theft and resale ofstreet drugs. USA Today leads with the latest evidence of the U.S.military's recruiting difficulties: the cost per enlistee is now at an all-timehigh. This is, the paper points out, money therefore not available to spend onservice members' training or housing. The New York Times front is a campaignmanager's dream: The lead is Al Gore's vow yesterday that if elected president,he would ban offshore drilling for gas and oil along both the California andFlorida coasts (the Clinton administration policy is a mere moratorium), andnearby is a reefer reporting that Bill Bradley yesterday advocated attackingchild poverty by raising the minimum wage, increasing child-care spending, andproviding working parents with various tax benefits. Pictures of the candidatesdominate the page.            The WP goes bottom front with a dispatch about how the batch ofappropriations bills currently on Congress' plate are salted with discreetlittle money plums for business: for auto companies, defense contractors,utilities, agribusiness, shipbuilders, chemical companies, and even anammunition manufacturer. Bennies like the $15 million for research onsupersonic aircraft noise reduction, a subsidy that will help Gulfstreamdevelop a supersonic business jet, apparently to meet the pressing nationalneed for fat guys in loud pants to get to golf tournaments quicker.            The WP front reports that Australian investigators operating as partof the peacekeeping forces in East Timor are beginning to arrive at anunderstanding of why, despite eyewitness accounts of the mass murder ofindependence advocates by Indonesia-affiliated militias, they have found verylittle murder evidence. They now believe, says the paper, that themilitiamen took pains to cover their tracks, in one case burning their victims'bodies and then dumping the ashes into crocodile-filled lakes, in anotherputting bodies in a boat and sinking it at sea. "In Kosovo, they didn't carewhat the world saw," one investigator is quoted saying. "The Indonesians areextremely concerned about saving face. They want to be able to deny any of thishappened."            The NYT and WP go inside with a new study of Americans' investment practices. The big news: Nearly halfof all households are in the market now, compared to just 19 percent in 1983.The other major finding: far more Americans practice buy-and-hold investingthan all the headlines about day traders would suggest, with 55 percent ofinvestors not making a single trade last year. And only 11 percent made tradesover the Internet. And the Wall Street Journal reports that a survey of nearly 400U.S. companies indicates that corporate profits are up huge: their aggregatethird quarter total is 27 percent ahead of last year.            The NYT fronts and the rest of the papers go inside with what isperhaps the world land speed record for credibility disintegration: not onlydoes that St. Martin's Press book alleging that George W. Bush has a cokeconviction in his past not contain a shred of convincing evidence, but it turnsout that the book's author is apparently a convicted felon who did a five-yearstretch for attempted murder. Confronted with the blow up, St. Martin's pulledthe book yesterday. As                   Slate               's Jacob Weisberg was the first to point out, the incident reminds thatquality control in the publishing business lacks only two things: quality andcontrol.
