                                 Takedown Ticktock            The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with the U.S. and its European allies putting diplomaticpressure on both Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanian leaders to accept a peaceaccord regarding Kosovo province before a Saturday deadline, while makingpreparations for NATO airstrikes in case they don't. The New York Timesdoesn't front Kosovo, its lead instead illustrating another step America istaking from an investigation of government to a government of investigationwith the news that the DOJ is considering appointing a special prosecutor toinquire into charges of misconduct by Kenneth Starr. USA Todayfronts neither story and leads instead with word that any day now, the EPA willpropose new emissions standards that would require minivans, light trucks, andmost SUVs to run as clean as cars by 2007. The new rules, says the paper, couldadd considerably to sticker price.            The WP explains that the principal stumbling block to a Kosovoagreement is that Slobodan Milosevic, head of Yugoslavia and a Serb, remainsopposed to a NATO peacekeeping force on Serbian soil. Both the WP andLAT leads report that Madeleine Albright spoke to Milosevic on the phoneyesterday, telling him that airstrikes would hit his country hard. TheLAT says NATO is thought to be targeting military communications sitesand barracks. The Post says the planned airstrikes would be the "biggestprojection of military power" since a NATO-led peacekeeping force moved intoBosnia more than three years ago. But the paper doesn't explain if this meansjust in this theater of operations, or if it would also be bigger than theraids recently conducted against Iraq. The LAT points out that it wasNATO bombing that helped force Milosevic to sign the Dayton peace accords thatended the fighting in Bosnia.            From the reporting, it's a little hard to understand the U.S. thinking onRussia's role in all this. The LAT quotes Albright saying she washopeful that Russia would participate in any Kosovo peacekeeping force and thatshe believed Russia was delivering a message to Milosevic as tough as the oneshe delivered to him. But, as does the WP , the LAT also reportsthat Boris Yeltsin on Thursday warned the U.S. not to stage any airstrikes, andsaid that Russia would stand by its Slavic brethren.            The LAT front goes long with a fascinating blow-by-blow on thecapture of Abdullah Ocalan over the byline of Richard Boudreaux, with theassistance of such stalwarts as John-Thor Dahlburg, Norman Kempster and RobinWright. The story flatly asserts the involvement of U.S. and Israeliintelligence agents and the government of Kenya, and strongly suggests advanceknowledge if not the full cooperation of the government of Greece. Perhaps thebiggest news of the piece is that Ocalan's presence in Nairobi was firstdetected, two days after he arrived, by FBI agents still there as part of theinvestigation of last summer's bombing of the U.S. embassy. British and Israeliagents independently became aware of his presence shortly thereafter.            A NYT front-pager covers the nearly tax-free status of cruise shipcompanies, a scandal first widely publicized by Donald Barlett and James Steelein their celebrated Philadelphia Inquirer series on America's economicdisparities in the 1980s, "What Went Wrong?". For instance, reports theTimes , the Carnival Corporation, larger than many Fortune 500 companies,earned $2 billion in the past three years while paying less than 1 percent inincome tax. This virtual immunity from tax, explains the Times , as wellas similar insulation against the nation's labor, safety, and environmentallaws, is enjoyed by all 17 major cruise lines because they are registered inforeign countries, even though their base of operations is in the U.S. and 90percent of their passengers are Americans.            The Wall Street Journal reports that Warner Bros. has refused arequest from the Marines to use a clip from its movie "Full Metal Jacket" in atraining CD-ROM about how to survive sniper attacks. The studio based itsrefusal on "serious piracy" concerns. In other words, in Burbank helpingMarines stay alive runs a distant second to squeezing out every last licensingdollar. The Marines should remember that the next time the studio comes askingfor technical assistance on a picture (as it no doubt did on "Full MetalJacket").
