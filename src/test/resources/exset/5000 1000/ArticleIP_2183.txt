                                                            A ToughDecision                        You might notice in the nextfew days, we hope, that Slate's pages are being served up to you a bit faster.(Well, this Thursday we were still serving up Wednesday's edition for a goodpart of the morning, but that's a different story.) The reason for theincreased speed is new Web server software. This is the software we use todeliver pages to you.            We knewit was time to upgrade, but we faced a dilemma: Which new server softwareshould we choose? The software business is viciously competitive, of course,and we didn't make our choice lightly. Deputy Editor Jack Shafer headed aninvestigative team of editors, writers, developers, and a demographicallycorrect cross section of Slate readers (83 percent male, 77 percent collegegraduates, 3.9 percent cross-dressers, 17 percent purchasers of a toaster orother electrical appliance in the past three months).            Our ServerSearch                TM team traveled theglobe in pursuit of the very best software for serving you, our readers. In anEskimo village near the Arctic Circle in Alaska, they sampled server softwaremade with whale blubber, as the natives have been doing it for thousands ofyears. In China, the team met a 6-year-old boy who has developed serversoftware based on Confucian principles and the sayings of the late chairmanDeng Xiaoping ("Better a pig with HTML than a donkey who knows DOS"). InSilicon Valley, they were wined, dined, and offered bribes by slicktwentysomething CEOs of companies with names like Fraudicom, EgoSoft, and GreedSystems PLC.            Back herein Redmond, the team rigorously tested each piece of software on geneticallyengineered laboratory mice. Could the mice design a Web page with workinghyperlinks? Did they develop cancer or brain tumors? Did they turn intoInternet bores? The software was then exposed to extreme conditions: zerogravity, below-freezing temperatures, peanut butter in the disk drive, elderlygrandparents with their first computers, etc.            Finally, the team reassembled for a retreat ata luxury resort in Maui. Human-resource facilitators were brought in to conducttrust games. An acupuncturist was hired to alleviate the stress of thismomentous decision. Several team members dropped out and had to be replaced byalternates. At a marathon all-night session, it took 73 ballots before aconsensus emerged. Bleary-eyed but triumphant, the team emerged into the moistHawaiian dawn to announce the winner to the awaiting world.            "We have chosen," Shaferdeclared, "Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0. There were many finecompetitors. But in the end we decided that Microsoft's product had the edge inease of use, elegance, and--above all--job security."            "Whew!"said Bill Gates. "That was a close one."                           Slate'sSchedule                        For new arrivals to our site(welcome!) and for regular readers who are a bit confused about our schedule(and who can blame them?), here is how it works. Slate posts new material everyweekday. Monday through Thursday, we "go to press" with the next day's editionat about 5 p.m. PST (8 p.m. EST). Friday, we publish the weekend edition atabout 11 a.m. PST (2 p.m. EST). In general, arts and cultural articles areposted early in the week, and newsier and political stuff is posted Thursdayand Friday. "TheWeek/The Spin" is updated throughout the week, the "Diary" has a newentry daily, and contributions to "Dispatches & Dialogues" are posted as they arrive."The Fray," our reader forum, is active 24 hours a day,seven days a week.            Most articles remain in thecurrent contents list for a week. All past articles, features, and columnsremain available in "The Compost."            "Slate on Paper," ourspecially formatted print-out version of Slate, is e-mailed to readersFriday around midday. It also can be downloaded from oursite. Those services are free. An actual paper edition of "Slate on Paper"can be mailed to you (call 800-555-4995), but that costs money and can take afew days to arrive.            Is allthat clear?                           --MichaelKinsley
