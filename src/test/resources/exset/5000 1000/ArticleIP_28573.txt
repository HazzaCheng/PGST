Who served up this baloney on Sunday, toinspire whom, to do what?

Randy'sWrap-Up                        With the gloriousexception of the St. Crispin's Day speech from Henry V , there is nothingmore demoralizing than an inspirational address. That sort of thing generallyentails a coach or an east regional sales manager exhorting you to do somethingpointless, painful, or profitable to someone else. Physics has fewinspirational speeches: Unify that Field Theory! Writing novels, performingsurgery, preparing a light and elegant souffl--each must be done withoutrousing declamation. Sex sometimes includes a heartening oration, but usuallytoward the end, urging you on to mutual victory; such remarks are rarelydelivered at halftime, when you're lurking in the locker room, glum andbattered. (The exception here is phone sex, where the inspirational speechpretty much is the sex.) "For the Senate and the Roman People"--that's whatgladiators used to say. Not too many people today seek inspiration from theSenate, although a surprising number do seek sex there, frequently for money.But they think themselves accurs'd and hold their manhoods cheap. Poorbastards.                           MotivationalAnswer                        Coach Pat Riley tried toinspire his Miami Heat to beat the New York Knicks. They didn't.
