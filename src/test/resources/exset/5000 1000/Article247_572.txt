                                 NATO's Rocky Road            The LAT leads with the U.S. stating that finally, Iraq has really beencooperating with U.N. weapons monitoring efforts. The top national story at theNYT is the Senate's debate about widening NATO. The WP leads with the decisionby federal corruption investigators to let Jimmy Hoffa's son, James P. Hoffa,run for the Teamsters presidency. USAT goes with the Treasury Department'slaunch of an investigation into the tactics of the IRS' criminal division.            The American admission was made Monday at the U.N. by U.S. Ambassador BillRichardson, about inspections of Iraq's nuclear program and previouslyoff-limits government buildings. But he went on to say that the U.S. continuesto oppose any relaxation of economic sanctions on Iraq or in the U.N.'s weaponsinspection program, citing, notes the LAT , Iraq's continuinginsufficient cooperation in the areas of long-range missiles and chemical andbiological weapons. This story also makes the fronts at USAT and theNYT , but the latter emphasizes the U.N.'s decision Monday night toextend sanctions despite Richardson's conciliatory remarks.            The nuances of the administration's thinking about sanctions are on displayin a NYT front-page piece that depicts Bill Clinton at a White Housemeeting of Christian evangelical leaders, unaware that a Times reporterwas there too. Clinton asked the group to withdraw its support for legislationaiming to reduce religious persecution overseas by imposing sanctions becausehe said such bills put enormous pressure on whoever is in the executive branchto fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is going on." The president needsflexibility, he said, including the ability to impose sanctions.            The NYT line on the NATO expansion discussion is that this is a quiteimportant issue that wasn't receiving its due in the Senate until yesterday,when "after four hours of dueling monologues, however, something novelhappened: Debate broke out." But judging by the Times examples, itwasn't exactly Lincoln-Douglas. There was Sen. Joseph Biden saying, "The worsttime to enlarge an alliance is at a moment of threat. This is the time and themoment, nine years after the wall has come down, to end once and for all theartificial boundaries," with Sen. Robert Smith responding, "They picked winnersand losers at Yalta. We are picking winners and losers here." (The Timeshelpfully explains that Biden is for expansion, Smith against.) And there'sSen. Jesse Helms' contribution: "The European Union could not fight its way outof a wet paper bag."            The LAT lead editorial sees the Senate in a "reckless rush" toapprove NATO expansion, stating that supporters have pressed their case withslogans, not arguments. The NYT notes that ice cream mogul Ben Cohen ofBen and Jerry's is actively campaigning against expansion. In Thomas Friedman'scolumn, Cohen explains why: Expanding NATO would be like Ben and Jerry's stillwanting to drive Haagen-Dazs out of business even if H-D had switched to makinghot dogs. The problem here is that Russia hasn't gotten rid of its, er.icecream machines.            The reader who makes it down to the fifteenth paragraph of the WPlead gets schooled on what it means to be a clean Teamster. That's where itsays that the federal investigator who gave Hoffa the green light fined him andseveral of his running mates in the last union election more than $40,000 forreceiving improper campaign contributions, and held that Hoffa "did not testifyaccurately" about his personal involvement in the preparation of campaignfinance reports. By contrast, the NYT , in its front-page Teamstersstory, broaches this point in the first paragraph, and observes in the fourthparagraph that as a result of the negative findings about Hoffa, neither sidein the upcoming Teamsters election can run as an untainted reformcandidate.            The WSJ "Work Week" column notes that the machinists union has licensed aspecial collector's item for its 110th anniversary: a Winchester Model 94rifle. Wait till the postal workers union hears about this.            That NYT piece that caught Bill Clinton speaking off the cuff aboutsanctions also includes his confession that late at night he often gets a callfrom Chelsea asking him about some item from the next day's paper that she'sread on the Internet, but that he knows nothing about. Mr. President, may"Today's Papers" humbly suggest."Today's Papers"?
