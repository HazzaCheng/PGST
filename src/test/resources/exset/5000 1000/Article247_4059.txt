                                 McCain POW Wow            The New York Times leads with how business lobbyists view thejust-concluded session of Congress. Very enthusiastically, says the paper, in astory running under a brutal headline: "CONGRESS LEAVES BUSINESS LOBBIES ALMOSTALL SMILES." The Washington Post goes with a sum-up of the FBIinvestigation into EgyptAir 990--an effort that by now involves hundreds ofagents in Washington, Cairo, and elsewhere. The Los Angeles Timesleads with a mushrooming source of medical inflation--the rising cost ofprescription medications advertised on television--which are typically at leasttwice as expensive as older, over-the-counter, unadvertised counterparts. Thepaper explains that since the FDA's 1997 decision to permit prescription drugTV commercials, average prescription costs have climbed at more than double thegeneral inflation rate. USA Today goes with a nonpartisan group'srecently compiled figures indicating that Bill Bradley has a fund-raising leadover Al Gore in California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey, and is alsoleading the money race in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two earliest primarystates.            According to the NYT , congressional victories for the businesslobby this past year included: repeal of Depression-era laws preventing banks,securities firms, and insurance concerns from entering one another's line ofbusiness, a five-year extension of the business R&D tax credit, no increasein the minimum wage, no regulation of health-care plans, no campaign financereform, and no ban on agribusiness mergers. The paper says business's"knockout"legislative feat was a triumph over the trial lawyers: passage of alaw limiting Y2K lawsuits.            According to the Post lead, the FBI's willingness to let the NTSB(the government's accident investigation body) remain for the time being incharge of the EgyptAir investigation, rather than officially ratcheting it upinto an up-front criminal probe, has a payoff: It placates the Egyptianauthorities, who therefore have been more cooperative in sharing flight andpersonnel records with the Bureau, which outside the U.S. has no power to seizeevidence. Also, shades of the dog who didn't bark, the Post revealsthat investigators are paying close attention to what the praying co-pilotdidn't say: "There was no shocked expletive or puzzled comment, as pilotstypically make in an emergency or when highly computerized aircraft suddenlytake action without pilot input."            Both the NYT and WP front stories about theself-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland, which broke off from Somalia five yearsago to escape the daily fighting between warlords there. The papers report thatSomaliland has indeed accomplished its goal of becoming a peaceful enclave, butneeds foreign cash if it is to actually become an independent nation. This at atime when the developed world is spending less and less on foreign aid.            An inside WP item by Howard Kurtz reports that in an Al Gore radioad making the rounds, the two women chatting about health care are not theordinary folks they seem to be, but are actresses reading from a script. Why isthis news? Hasn't Kurtz ever heard of Harry and Louise?            In a NYT op-ed, retired Adm. James B. Stockdale responds to recentallegations that some Senate colleagues of John McCain think he was renderedunbalanced by his five years in a North Vietnamese prison. Stockdale vouchesfor the rock-solid temperament of his fellow former Hanoi Hilton resident.That's to be expected--but what's really newsy here is that Stockdale reportsthat an old friend he describes as close to the George W. Bush campaignrecently called him soliciting comments on McCain's "weaknesses." This is thefirst solid link between Bush and the anti-McCain whispering campaign.            The Wall Street Journal features a Desert Storm memoir byactive-duty Air Force Gen. Mark Welsh that was originally delivered to cadetsat the Air Force Academy. The talk contains the following compelling andreassuring passage, about a transport helicopter pilot, who came up on theradio volunteering to go pick up a fighter pilot shot down over a heavyconcentration of Iraqi troops: "You need to remember a Chinook is about thesize of a double-decker London bus with props, and it doesn't have guns. We kidaround a lot about interservice rivalries, but I guarantee that I would followthat Army helicopter pilot into combat. I'll never forget her voice."
