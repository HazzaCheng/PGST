                                 Apostrophe S            The House Republicans' passage of a health-insurancebill leads at the New York Times and is atop theWall Street Journal 's "Worldwide" box. (TheWashington Post , which usually plays upCapitol Hill intrigue, reefers this story.) The GOP's response to George W.Bush's criticisms of it on Tuesday is the lead at USA Today and the top non-local story at the Post . The Los AngelesTimes leads with the National Football League's decision to pass overthe City of Angels and put an expansion team in Houston instead. (This story isput above the fold by USAT and reefered by theNYT and Post .) AHouston billionaire offered over $700 million for the team--the highest priceever paid for a pro sports franchise--plus a publicly financed, $300 millionglass-walled stadium with a retractable roof.            The $50 billion (over 10 years) health-insurance billwould, among other things, a) accelerate the 100 percent tax deduction for theself-employed, b) expand the availability of tax-free accounts for medicalpayments, and c) create tax deductions for long-term-care insurance. TheDemocrats said the bill would help only 1 percent of the population, andPresident Clinton threatened to veto it in its present form. But the main eventis today, when the House votes on competing "patient rights" bills, which wouldallow customers to sue their HMOs. (On Tuesday, the House leadership for thefirst time threw its weight behind a limited right to sue--see yesterday's TP fordetails.)            All the papers, save the LAT , run follow-ups to George W. Bush's rebuke of congressionalRepublicans on Tuesday. Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, and some Hill Republicansaccused Bush of abandoning the GOP rank and file, and Bush backtrackedslightly, stressing that the GOP's image as heartless was a Democraticcaricature, not reality. USAT calls the GOPresponse a "backlash" against Bush, but the other papers are more favorable tohim. The NYT story stresses the inability ofcongressional Republicans to soften their image post-Newt Gingrich; thePost notes that Bush's policy positions arestill solidly conservative, despite Bauer's and Forbes' assertions to thecontrary; and the Journal calls Bush's Tuesdayremarks his "Sister Souljah moment"--referring to candidate Clinton'ssuccessful 1992 strategy of distancing himself from his party's ideologicalbase. (For Ballot Box's take on the Bush-GOP brouhaha, click here.)                        The LAT fronts the FBI'sdisclosure that the computer networks of the Pentagon, Energy Department, NASA,and of defense contractors have undergone a year of extensive, coordinatedcyberattacks from overseas computers--some from Moscow. The hackers have stolenunclassified but sensitive information on weapons research. One thing holdingup effective countermeasures, the Post writes, is a culture clash between low-techFBI agents and the geeky computer consultants helping them with encryption.            Following up on a Journalstory yesterday, the NYT reports that a diet pill company is using aWebsite to broadcast an ABC News interview of its chief executivebefore ABC has aired the program in which theinterview will be used. (Companies often make their own tapes of theirinterviews with the press.) Metabolife International Inc. says that afterdiscovering the Web site of ABC interviewer Arnold Diaz (titled "Schemes, Scams, and Savin' a Buck"), it beganto suspect that ABC's report will be unfair to its product, so it released theentire interview on the Internet as part of a counteroffensive. Today's Papersenvisions a world in which every interview subject is his own media watchdog;when a reporter quotes him out of context, the subject need not beg an editoror producer for space or time to respond--he can simply publish the uneditedinterview himself.            The Journal notes thedemise of a hallowed cultural institution: the wedding-night consummation.These days, half of all couples live together before marriage, and less thanone-fifth are virgins on their wedding night. As a result, manynewlyweds--one-third of 18-to-24-year-olds and half of those over 40--wouldrather spend their wedding night engaged in non-connubial activities likepartying with wedding guests visiting from afar. "Sex, when it happens" fornewlyweds, reports the Journal , "is often anapostrophe, not an exclamation point."
