                                 Greenspanic            The Los AngelesTimes , USAToday , and the WallStreet Journal (in its "Business and Finance" box) lead with the stockmarket's biggest plunge in over a year--a story off-leaded by the New York Times and Washington Post. The Nasdaqindex fell 5.6 percent (after gaining 86 percent in 1999) and the Dow fell 3.2percent (after gaining 25 in '99). Analysts attribute the sell-off to taxincentives arriving with the new year and to heightened fears of aninterest-rate hike when the Federal Reserve Board meets on Feb. 1. TheNYT and Post lead with President Clinton's announcement thathe will nominate Alan Greenspan for a fourth four-year term as chairman of theFed. USAT and the LAT mention Clinton's announcement in theirstock-market leads, while the Journal puts it fourth from the top inits "Business and Finance" box.The Journal says that Clinton's announcement "mak[es] official whatmarkets had been expecting and what politicians from both parties had beenendorsing for months." The Post , however, writes that "some participants in the financial markets hadbegun to speculate that Clinton might not reappoint [Greenspan], or that theadministration would try to influence Fed interest-rate policy in exchange forthe reappointment." So, are the market dip and Greenspan's appointment related?Yes and no: While Wall Street analysts laud Clinton's move, his announcement frees Greenspan frompolitical pressure to keep rates down. But the papers also blame the sell-offon tax laws--capital gains earned now are not taxed until April 2001--and anovervalued technology sector.USAT 's stock-market story describes the Nasdaq's drop as "breathtaking" but goes on to notethat it was "long overdue" and only the eighth-largest percentage drop in theindex's history. Both USAT and the Post begin a paragraph with the same hackneyedsentence: "The carnage was widespread." In his NYT column, Paul Krugman asks, "Why was the market soeasily spooked? Presumably because everyone--me included--is even more confusedthan usual about what stocks are really worth these days."            The Post fronts an announcement by a Chinese economic planner thatprivate enterprises should be put on an "equal footing with state-ownedenterprises" for the first time since the 1949 revolution. Although thePost quotes an expert labeling this a "significant ideological shift,"a NYT story on the announcement, run inside, focuses instead on China'sinability to grow fast enough to assure jobs for its ballooningworkforce.USAT fronts and the NYT reefers the development of a new test for pre-cancerousconditions in the cervix. Unlike a Pap smear, which requires a pelvic exam anddetermines if cervical tissue is pre-cancerous, the new procedure tests for thepresence of a pre-cancerous virus and can be self-administered. The HPVtest--for human papilloma virus, which can cause cervical cancer in women over40--could save many lives in the developing world, where lack of access to Paptests leads to nearly 200,000 preventable deaths every year.The Post and Journal report that Labor SecretaryAlexis Herman backtracked from an Occupational Safety and Health Administrationnotice requiring employers to provide proper furniture, lighting, heating, andventilation systems to employees working at home. (The Journal creditsthe Post --which broke the storyyesterday--in its third paragraph.) "The [ Post ] story raised animportant debate that we need to have about the workplace of the future," saidHerman, who wants to "open a dialogue on the issue" rather than inspectworkers' homes en masse . An op-ed in the Journal argues thatthe OSHA guidelines are part of a pattern of Clinton administration electoralfavors to labor unions (because the guidelines discourage telecommuters, whoare hard to organize).The NYT reports that Seattle will drop all but 40 remaining misdemeanorcharges against WTO protestors. Many of the protestors decried the decision;they were looking forward to grandstanding during their trials. In theJournal 's California edition, a retrospective "news article" tocommemorate the state sesquicentennial hearkens back to an era when a differentkind of justice prevailed:                           SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 1856--With the sheriff unable, or unwilling, to keepcrime in check, the city's 3,000-member Committee of Vigilance stepped into thebreach. Over the past three months, the committee brags, it has hanged fouraccused murderers, banished 30 criminals and troublemakers from the region andrun untold numbers of "Sydney Ducks"--as convicts from Australia are known--outof town.
