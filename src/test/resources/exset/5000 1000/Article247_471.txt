                                 The Disney Exercise Program            Yesterday, everybody had the same lead--today, nobody does. USA Todayleads with a major new comparative study of Americans' life spans. The New York Timesleads with South Korea's acceptance of the largest international economicrescue ever, a $55 billion bailout engineered by the IMF. The Washington Post goes with Motorola's decision to make itslargest single capital investment ever, in the form of a new computer chipplant near Richmond, Va. The Los Angeles Times lead is a survey suggesting that42 percent of Californians with medical insurance had a problem with theirhealth plan, including hundreds of thousands who reported denials or delays ingetting treatment, which often made their medical conditions worse.                           USAT 's longevity study lead reveals that the gap between the longestand shortest American lifespans--where life expectancy can vary by as much as40 years from one county to another--is about as big as that found between thenations with the longest and shortest lifespans. For instance, an Asian womanliving in Bergen County, NJ, can expect to live for 96 years, while the averageblack man in Washington D.C., lives to age 58. The paper says the director ofthe CDC finds the results incredible, adding that they will probably serve as ablueprint for research into disease and urban violence.            The WP runs a front-page piece driving home the study's applicationsto the Washington/Virginia region, noting that it reveals that D.C. men havenearly the shortest life span in the country, while men just across the Potomacin suburban Virginia have nearly the longest--a difference of 14.5 years. Notsurprisingly, one expert quoted pins the difference on economic status--inother words, that Motorola plant's only going to make things worse.            The NYT explains in its lead that in return for the bailout moneyfrom the IMF and such countries as the U.S. and Japan, Korea will have to cutpublic spending, open its market up to more foreign goods and investors and putgrowth constraints on its conglomerate industries. All of which, says theTimes , could be very good for the U.S. economy.            120 nations (that's the NYT number; the LAT and USATsay 125) gathered yesterday in Ottawa to sign a comprehensive land mine ban.The U.S. was the most conspicuous non-signer. As you'd expect, the story isfront-page news at the NYT , LAT , and USAT . But theWP puts it on p. 33.            Both the NYT and WP give front-page coverage (with pictures)to President Clinton's first town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio. Andboth papers give a lot of ink to an exchange between Clinton and AbigailThernstrom, a conservative critic of affirmative action. Clinton, on his feet,"towering" over the seated Thernstrom, asked her if she favored the U.S. Armyabolishing the affirmative action program that "produced" Colin Powell. TheNYT version makes it look like Thernstrom didn't respond very clearly.The WP account says she replied, "The overwhelming majority of Americanswant American citizens to be treated as individuals."            The Wall Street Journal "Business Bulletin" reports thatUniversity Microfilms, long the nation's main repository for doctoraldissertations, has now made them available on the Web. Which means, says theJournal , you are but a few clicks away from reading the Ph.D. theses ofthe likes of Bill Cosby, Dr. Ruth and the Unabomber. But not AlanGreenspan's--he asked that his "Papers on Economic Theory and Policy" not bemade available.            Back to that LAT lead about health plan problems: One Californian whoprobably doesn't have these difficulties is Disney poohbah Michael Eisner, who,says the LAT in a nearby front-pager, yesterday had the single biggestexecutive payday in history when he exercised stock options bringing in $565million. A little perspective on that sum: it could pay the salaries of everymember of Congress for about a decade.
