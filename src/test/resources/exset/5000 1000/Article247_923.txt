                                 Is Furby a Must-Buy?            Here's a brief sordid history of toys-of-the-year: Fisticuffs have eruptedover Cabbage Patch Kids; Tickle-Me-Elmos have been stockpiled and scalped forbank-breaking prices; Beanie Baby counterfeiters have taken rubes to thecleaners; and this year's toy-of-the-year--Furby--is already sold out ofseveral chains and is being auctioned off on eBay for up to $200 apiece            I first got suspicious about Furbys when I read their online instructions,which sounded like an excerpt from a pornographic version of G.B. Shaw'sPygmalion :            "Before you play with me, please follow these simple steps:                           Turn me upside down and open my battery door.               Insert four (4) AA batteries into my battery compartment. PLEASE DO NOTCLOSE THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT YET.               While holding me upside down, put your finger in my mouth and hold down mytongue switch, then hit Reset button               While holding my tongue switch, please close my battery door and secure thescrew.               I will now wake up and tell you my name. I am now ready to play!"                        The doll looks more like a Gremlin than a Galatea--furry, big ears, bigeyes, no neck. The source of its appeal, however, is Galatea-like: You teach,it learns. It has a motor, internal speakers, a computer chip, a light sensor,a sound sensor, and touch sensors, so in addition to old-hat tricks likeblinking and "dancing," Furby knows whether you're in the room and will talk,sing, and generally act cute. But most importantly, Furby responds to Pavlovianconditioning.            When you first get the Furby, for instance, you can tickle its stomach andit may or may not give you a kiss. If it kisses you and you immediately pat iton the back, you increase the likelihood of it kissing you next time you tickleits tummy. Furbys also have their own language, Furbish, "which is heavilyinfluenced by the languages of Thai, Chinese, Mandarin, and Hebrew." Over time,your Furby will abandon Furbish and begin to "learn" English (actually, itdoesn't really learn--it's just programmed to begin speaking more English wordsafter a while). The Furby can even communicate with and "teach" other Furbystricks and songs by means of infrared signals similar to the ones in a TVremote control device. If one Furby sings a lullaby, the other will fall asleepand snore. If you play music, the Furbys will dance together.            This is all very cool from an adult's perspective. From the child'sperspective, though, the Furby has drawbacks, such as:                           The Carapace Issue. In order to protect the various motors, there has to bea rigid plastic shell under the fur, which makes the thing hard to hug.Although press materials call it a "cuddly standalone animatronic pet," in mybook, "animatronic" cancels out "cuddly."                                       The Work Issue. Who wants to train a toy to kiss you, when every kid knowsthat a regular stuffed animal kisses you every time you touch its plastic noseto your cheek?                                       The Breakability Issue. The delicate plastic ear bones are just begging tobe snapped, and the toy's many cool functions spark curiosity about how it allworks. In order to satisfy that curiosity, you have to skin Furby and crackopen the internal plastic shell.

As soon as you read that Furby's uniquelanguage is "heavily influenced by the languages of Thai, Chinese, Mandarin,and Hebrew," you know that this is a toy that parents will like more than kids.Same goes for all the tricks Furby learns that are cool in concept--but boringafter about a week.                        Is your child too young for a Furby? Will it create more frustration andheartbreak than happiness? Is $30 retail (or up to $200 online) too much forwhat you get? Do you want a furry animatronic pet that burps (and worse) afteryou "feed" it by pushing down on its tongue? These questions are all worthconsidering before you join in on a Furby auction, break into a cold sweat overthe grim warning on Furby fan pages: "WAL-MART NOW OUT OF FURBYS!!!!!," orsmuggle a stun-gun into Toys-R-Us to disable the competition.            -- Eliza Truitt
