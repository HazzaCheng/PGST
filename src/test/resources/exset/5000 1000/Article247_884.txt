                                 This Ain't Selling Out, It's Buying In            Ah, the golden age of magazines! Few people are more credulous about thatfabled era than journalists who cover the media industry. How else to explaintwo recent articles in the New York Times and the New YorkObserver lamenting the decline of editorial integrity in Americanmagazines?            In its Business section yesterday, the Times described a proposedjoint promotion by Vogue and Elizabeth Arden in which Arden sends free productsto Vogue readers. This, the reporter wrote disapprovingly, is "only thelatest example of how publishers are exploding the traditional businessboundaries of the magazine industry." (Other examples: magazines generatingin-house research for advertisers; free trips for New                Yorkerwriters on an advertiser's cruiseship; and more Vogue hijinks, such as alecture series at Columbia for advertisers and a Vogue -Tommy Hilfigerparty in the Hamptons.)            Leaving aside how delighted Culturebox would be to get freebies fromElizabeth Arden (doesn't the Times know how much that stuff costs?):What's new about this? When did women's fashion magazines exist to do anythingother than push advertisers' wares? Consider this tidbit from Hope in a Jar:The Making of America's Beauty Culture by Kathy Peiss, a just-publishedhistory of the American beauty industry:            "When J. Walter Thompson conducted an investigation of the toiletries marketfor Pond's in 1923, McCall 's Service Department mailed eighteen hundredquestionnaires to women readers, and Hazel Rawson Cades, beauty editor of theWoman's Home Companion , opened her readers' mail to the ad agency.Harper's Bazaar introduced a Debutante Department in 1928 to gain marketinformation for advertisers; it surveyed three thousand well-to-do young women,rewarding each with a grab bag of cosmetic gifts. Similarly, in themid-thirties, the Delineator 's Beauty Institute called upon eighthundred readers to be 'beauty consultants' for product development andmarketing purposes."            Given the unillustrious history of the beauty magazine, it seems foolish ofthe Times to make Vogue 's co-promotional side deal stand for anyominous larger trend in the industry. Also, in what way is the Voguedeal corrupt if it doesn't directly affect editorial copy? Not thatVogue copy isn't corrupt, mind you--everyone knows that beautybooks feature only the clothes and cosmetics of advertisers. It's just thatVogue 's latest scheme strikes us as an unusually innocuous way topander.            Which brings us to the New York Observer . Last Wednesday it broke thestory (later reported in the Times too) that, in exchange for a lectureor two, New Yorker writers and editors will be flown to the SouthPacific and other idyllic spots for a week's cruise courtesy of an advertiser.The Times and the Observer treated this as a stealth attack bybusiness on editorial. Culturebox considers it proof that the world is awondrous place for New Yorker writers. I mean, no one's even asking themto write articles about the cruise line!            Besides, this isn't new either. The                New Yorker has sent itswriters on freebie cruises before, and not under much-maligned editor TinaBrown. Staff writer Mark Singer tells Culturebox that he took the Delta Queenthrough the lower Mississippi River in 1992, with the blessing of then-editorRobert Gottlieb. His companion was the late New Yorker writer BrendanGill. Both writers gave lectures and were paid "cash dollars," says Singer. "Wewouldn't have done it otherwise. They really made us sing for our supper. ... Ididn't have any ethical qualms or quibbles. I wasn't going to write a travelpiece or anything."            In a memoir whose title Culturebox is too lazy to dig up, Arnold Gingrich, afounding editor of Esquire , recalled that in the 1950s, when men begangoing bareheaded, the business side of the magazine tried to stem the declineof an valued advertising category by decreeing that all male Esquireemployees wear hats or be fired. McCalls sent its readersquestionnaires; Vogue wants to send them make-up. Esquireemployees wore unfashionable hats; New Yorker employees go on cruises.What was that about the world getting worse?            -- Judith Shulevitz
