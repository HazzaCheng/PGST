                                 Secret Gore Strategy Revealed!            Vice President Al Gore is doing his part to protect President Clinton fromimpeachment. The new Gore strategy apparently calls for Gore to be as annoyingas possible, thereby reminding congressional decisionmakers of the potentialcost of removing Clinton from office. Gore initiated his campaign last week,when he announced plans to spend $20 to $50 million in taxpayers' money toimplement a midnight brainstorm of his: Putting a continuous, live image ofplanet Earth, as seen from space, on the Internet! NASA chief Daniel Goldin hasbeen dragooned into supporting Gore's goo-goo caprice. As John Pike, directorof the space policy project at the Federation of American Scientists, toldElizabeth Shogren of the Los Angeles Times : "The Earth is big and theweather is slow, so it's not like there is perceptible motion. It is about asexciting as watching the grass grow." Sort of like watching the vice presidenthimself! ... Gore continued his scare campaign by phoning WashingtonPost Executive Editor Len Downie to complain that a photo the Posthad run of the big-blue-marble Earth was upside down! Only after Gore hung updid Downie realize that there is no "right side up" or "upside down" when youare looking at a sphere from outer space ... Gore's campaign appears to behighly effective, as Clinton's approval ratings have kept rising despite newand dramatic sex charges. ... Chatterbox, calling on its extensive network ofinsider contacts, has learned details of future components of the still-secretGoreBore initiative, which will include: A national campaign to convertfootball fields to the metric system; a Global Engineering Olympics to betelevised during halftime of the NCAA championship basketball game; a giganticTemple of Science to be built on the Mall in Washington, featuring animatronicdemographers discussing overpopulation; and a proposal to have "students of theworld ... gather and study environmental information on a daily basis andcommunicate that data to the world through television." ... And everyone willwear their underwear on the outside, so we can check! .... Actually, that lastbit about having students gather daily environmental information isn't phony.It's genuine Gorebore ...                           QUID PRO QUO?                60 Minutes sure pulled out all the stops onSunday to make Kathleen Willey look good. The black-and-white photograph ofNathan Landow, the developer who allegedly pressured Willey to keep quiet, madehim look like a vicious psychopath. The photo of Julie Steele, who says Willeytold her to lie, made her look as if she'd just tried out a vacuum cleaner onher abundant graying hair. ... All this may be part of the implicit deal 60Minutes strikes with an important source like Willey. But viewers should bewarned. ... Chatterbox knows how this game is played, mister! ... CBS's EdBradley conducted a similarly kid-gloved interview with Anita Hill during theClarence Thomas mess ... Bradley's worst sin last Sunday? He brought out thatWilley knew Clinton had the hots for her from an earlier incident whenthen-candidate Clinton had asked her to bring some chicken soup to his room.But then Bradley neglected to ask the obvious question: since Willey was awareof Clinton's interest, wasn't she hoping to use her sexual attraction to helpher get the paying White House job she desperately needed? Willey might easilyhave answered the question--she might have even said, "Yes, but I didn't expecthim to jump me right there in the Oval Office"--without undermining her story.But it would have been nice if Bradley had asked ...                           INTO THE VOID: If Bradley almost flunked Journalism 101, Paula Jones'lawyers definitely flunked PR 101. What possessed them to release their700-page trove of anti-Clinton documents on a Friday? Doesn't every sentientAmerican know by now that Friday is when you release news you want tobury , because Friday news gets reported in the little-read Saturdaypapers? ... When Chatterbox reveals what it did in the '60s, you can bet itwill be on a Friday! ...
