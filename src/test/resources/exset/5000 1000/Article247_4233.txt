                                 Russians to Judgment            The Washington Post , New York Times and Los AngelesTimes lead with the early returns from Russia's parliamentaryelections, surprising because they show that centrist and reform parties,including a brand-new Kremlin-based bloc, the Unity party, have made gains thatsignificantly cut into the power long wielded in the legislature by thecommunists. The Wall Street Journal runs the Russian election at the top ofits world-wide news box. USA Today puts it deep inside, leading instead with theU.S. government's search for one to three accomplices of an alleged Algerianterrorist caught on Friday trying to cross into the U.S. from Canada with abomb-kit in his car. The story describes a federal law enforcementestablishment both practicing and urging heightened anti-terrorist awarenessheading into the new year, a topic that is fronted by the LAT , reeferedat the NYT and carried inside at the WP .            Both the WP and NYT say high up that the election resultsfigure to be a boost to the presidential ambitions of Prime Minister VladimirPutin. The LAT doesn't mention Putin until the 17th paragraph. Everybodyagrees that the election is something of a referendum on the Yeltsin-Putinaggressive stance against Chechen rebels--the parties that strongly support itdid best. The LAT reminds of the volatility of Russian politics when itpoints out that all this comes seven months after Yeltsin was nearly impeachedby parliament for starting a war in Chechnya.            The WP , LAT and USAT front the death toll in Venezuelafrom flooding and mudslides. The high estimate: 5,000 killed and 150,000 lefthomeless.            The NYT , WP and USAT front the biggest news fromyesterday's televised joint appearance of Bill Bradley and Al Gore:Gore's challenge to Bradley to agree to stop all television and radiocommercials and debate regularly instead. Bradley turned Gore down, refusing toshake Gore's extended hand, the papers say, calling the idea "ridiculous." (Thedebate was also covered in                   Slate               's "PunditCentral," "BallotBox," and "Chatterbox.")                           USAT 's "Money" section front points to a Y2K-related panic point fewhave discussed before now: a possible year-end-driven gascrunch that could, in the paper's words, "make lines at ATM machines andsupermarket checkouts seem tame by comparison." People can stock up on water,food, batteries, and cash over weeks, the story notes, but most people cannotstore gasoline except in their cars, which means any rush to pump will takeplace mostly on Dec. 30th and 31st.            The WP inside serves up two dispatches from the bureaucracy front: 1)The government has ruled that the 1988 CIA budget--that's right the 19 88budget, a budget spent almost entirely on combating a country that no longerexists--should remain secret; 2) The chairman of Exxon Mobil says that for therecent merger that created his company, government regulators required theproduction of more than 31.2 million pieces of paper.            The NYT business section cites a fact that puts much Internet hypeinto perspective while powerfully explaining the rationale of the recent spateof "clicks and mortar" business deals: Wal-Mart is expected to report nearly$143 billion in domestic revenue for fiscal 1999, roughly 7 percent of theUnited States retail market and seven times all Internet sales combined.            The WSJ reports that foreign investors now own about 40 percent ofU.S. debt. This is double the percentage, says the paper, of five years ago.The reason: the flight of capital from slumping economies like Japan's combinedwith the drawdown of the U.S. debt. The USAT front-page "Snapshot"presents a simple comparison between the cost of the federal debt per person in1900:$16 and now:$20,800. Interesting, but a little too simple: It's not(apparently) adjusted for inflation.            The LAT weighs in with its story on the paper's Staples Centerfiasco. The piece, by the paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning media writer DavidShaw, will fill 14 pages, complete with sidebars and graphics. In thepreparation of the piece, Shaw had his own computer account that was notaccessible by even senior executives and editors at the paper. And when thepiece was completed, the negatives of it, ordinarily faxed to the printingplant several blocks away in downtown L.A., were hand-carried there instead.The result of all this security is that even LAT editor Michael Parkswill have to wait for the thud in his driveway this morning before he can readShaw's opus de oops. (It will become available at the paper's web site as of 6a.m. PT.) Hmmm...wasn't this whole imbroglio about the paper's tendency to keeptoo many staffers in the dark?
