                                 The Winnable War                        Hi, Jim,            Maybe the sting is finally out of the Vietnam War debate. Your comments wereso reasonable, it's hard to believe the subject was Vietnam. When I look backnow at the Vietnam era and recall what people (including me) thought and said,I think a dark cloud must have passed over the country. Passions were so greaton both sides of the debate in the United States--I was antiwar at thetime--that few people have honestly reconsidered their views or taken a freshlook at the war and its results.            With all the Vietnam books pouring out, I'd been looking for months for arevisionist take, one that didn't accept either of the liberal explanations(the United States missed opportunities for a settlement; the war wasunwinnable) or the conservative one (politicians tied the hands of themilitary). But serious Vietnam revisionism barely existed--until Michael Lind'sbook came along. I know Mike, but only slightly, and I haven't read any of hisearlier books. I was excited when I read Vietnam: The Necessary War , andI think it's an enormously important book.            Let me start with three points:            1) Yes, I basically agree with your characterization of the theme of thebook. And I agree with Lind that even an ultimately unsuccessful interventionwas better than none at all. I'm not the first to make the point that Asiawould probably be quite different today (and far worse off) if the UnitedStates had pulled out in, say, 1963 or 1964. Then, the dominoes might reallyhave fallen; two did anyway (Laos and Cambodia). Peter Kann of the WallStreet Journal has written that a breathing spell was needed in Asia toallow free markets and political freedoms to grow. And, boy, did they growduring that 10-year period from 1965 to 1975 while the United States staved offthe North Vietnamese. Would Thailand be a free country today absent that? Idoubt it. Would Indonesia or Malaysia or Taiwan be independent?            2) Lind may overstate the bandwagon effect in world affairs, but there'scertainly something to it. The proof is what happened post-1975 after theUnited States did bug out. Then, the Soviet Union was emboldened and Americawas demoralized. The Soviets were soon on the move in Asia, Africa, and LatinAmerica. And at least two administrations (Ford, Carter) were all butparalyzed, and Congress was dead set against intervening anywhere. The defeatin Vietnam gave the Soviet Union and the rest of the world the message that theUnited States was out of the game for a while. And this was an accuratemessage. Lind's contention is that things would have even worse if the UnitedStates had simply taken a pass on Vietnam. A more damaging message would havebeen sent and a bigger bandwagon effect touched off. As for minimal realism,it's an excuse for neo-isolationism, for an ever-shrinking United States rolein international affairs. It could have been invoked to let the North Koreanstake the South, the Chinese Communists seize Taiwan, and Communist guerillasconquer Malaysia. I'm glad it wasn't.            3. There's one area where I think Lind comes up short. He thinks the UnitedStates, given the way the war was being fought, should have pulled out in 1968,if only to avert the subsequent casualties that, he argues, wound up weakeningAmerica's determination to combat Soviet and Chinese communism. He's rightabout the way the war was fought under Gen. William Westmoreland from 1964 to1968. Wrongheaded is a mild way of characterizing it. Westmoreland tried tolure the enemy into big battles and stressed body counts. Meanwhile, most ofSouth Vietnam was falling under Communist control. But everything changed whenWestmoreland left. His replacement, Gen. Creighton Abrams, adopted a newstrategy, stopped fighting major battles, and began piecemeal seizure of landfrom the Communists. His pacification program brought security and a bettereconomy to rural areas. The Phoenix program wiped out the Viet Cong'sinfrastructure. By 1970, the war was won militarily--or almost won. The SouthVietnamese army had become a capable force. All that was needed to save SouthVietnam was what the United States did in South Korea: leave a couple Americandivisions and provide military and other support for the government. The truthis, the war in Vietnam was winnable.
