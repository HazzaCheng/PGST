                                 Herzo Good            The First Family's visit to Bosnia-Herzogovina leads at the New York Times ,LosAngeles Times , and USA Today , and is the top national story at theWashington Post .            The Bosnia stories--all accompanied by big top-of-the page photos of thepresident, the best one being the LAT 's shot of Bill, Hillary, andChelsea up close and personal with American soldiers--all point out thatClinton's quick mission had the dual purpose of boosting the morale of U.S.troops and urging Bosnians to work harder on their country's recovery. Thepitch to the Bosnians, both in private consultations with national leaders andin a public speech in Sarajevo, included Clinton's insistence on the importanceof isolating and arresting indicted war criminals.            The NYT , USAT , and the LAT all go front page with thenews that the FDA has approved prescription of an anti-baldness pill. This comesafter experiments showing that the substance either promoted hair growth or atleast stopped hair loss in 83 percent of the men who took it. The approval camedespite recognition that the pills carry a slight risk of impotence and reducedsex drive. (That there is expected to be a strong market for the medicationdespite these possible side-effects is yet more evidence of the growingnarcissism of the American man, who apparently is more interested in lookingsexy than being sexy.)                           USAT runs a front-page piece about the career-ending spinal injurysuffered by Detroit linebacker Reggie Brown in a game Sunday. The piece focuseson the inspirational story of teammates and opponents praying for him on thefield while doctors worked on him feverishly, but treads lightly around theNFL's dirty little not-so-secret: namely, that because of the incredibleincreases in the size, strength, and speed of the players, serious spinal andhead injuries are becoming more common all the time. So much so that profootball is now far more dangerous than those "ultimate fighting championships"that are outlawed in all but a few states.            Call it the integration of church and (solid-) state. The Wall Street Journal reports in a front-page feature on anew trend: telecommunications companies paying churches for the right to putwireless transmission equipment in their steeples. It's a match made in heaven:The companies get a nifty end-run around local bans on new towers and thechurches get an income stream far more reliable than the collection plate.            Yesterday's LAT front-page story about Bill Clinton's 1996fund-raising juggernaut bears revisiting. Closer inspection of the illustrationaccompanying the piece, purporting to be of Clinton's schedule for one week inJune 1996, reveals that it is deeply deceptive. Although as the fine printsays, it is compiled from official sources, it is not a photograph ofthe president's daybook, but rather a representation of his schedule concoctedby the LAT 's editors made to look like one. And not a very accurate oneeither: for instance, in a trick that's repeated throughout the graphic, thefund-raising entries for Monday, June 17 form a solid block of type, but thisis a trompe l'oeil achieved only by leaving a bunch of hours out of the"daybook"'s format. This sleight-of-hand is just as unacceptable as the similarnewsmagazine cover practices of sinisterizing OJ and beautifying Quint Mom, orthe bygone TV fad of "re-creation." One hopes that this newspaper variant canalso be shamed out of favor.            The WP and LAT fronts report on that nearly $5million verdict won by actress Hunter Tylo, who sued because she was hired toplay a seductress on 'Melrose Place' but was then fired by producer AaronSpelling's company when it was revealed she was pregnant. Spelling officialshad claimed that a visibly pregnant woman couldn't be credible in the sexyrole. The Post quotes Tylo's lawyer saying it was important for the juryto see that Tylo, who was eight months into another pregnancy during the trial,"looked unbelievably sexy and terrific" as she came to court in short, tightskirts. Spelling's attorney says there will be an appeal. But the main wayHollywood deals with onrushing bandwagons is to jump right on, so stay tuned inthe fall for the new voluptuous pregnant chick series, "Cervixens!"
