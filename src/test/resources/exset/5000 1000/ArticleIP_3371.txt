                                 That Evening at Dinner            To hear the poet read"That Evening at Dinner," click .            By the last few times wesaw her it was clearThat things were different. When you tried to help herGetout of the car or get from the car to the doorOr across the apartment househall to the elevatorThere was a new sense of heavinessOr of inertia in thebody. It wasn'tThat she was less willing to be helped to walkBut that thewalking itself had become less willing.Maybe the stupid demogorgonblindRecalcitrance of body, resentful of the lawsOf mind and spirit, wasgetting its own back now,Or maybe a new and subtle, alien,Intelligence of bodywas obedient nowTo other laws: "Weight is the measure of The force with which abody is drawn downward To the center of the earth"; "Inertia isThe tendency ofa body to resist Proceeding to its fate in any wayOther than that determinedfor itself."            That evening, at theBromells' apartment, after She had been carried up through the rationalstructureBy articulate stages, floor after flashing floor,And after we helpedher get across the hall,And get across the room to a chair, somehowWe got herseated in a chair that was placedA little too far away from the nearesttable,At the edge of the abyss, and there she sat,Exposed, her body the objectof our attention--The heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg,The thickstocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe.            At work between herselfand us there wasA new principle of social awkwardnessAnd skillfulness requiredof each of us.Our tones of voice in this easy conversationWere instruments ofmarvelous finesse,Measuring and maintaining with exactitude"The fact orcondition of the differenceThere was between us, both in space and time."Hersmiling made her look as if she hadJust then tasted something delicious, thecharmHer courtesy attributed to her friends.            This decent elegant fellowhuman beingWas seated in virtue, character, disability,Behind her the order ofthe ranged bookshelves,The windows monitored by Venetian blinds--"These can beraised or lowered; numerous slats,Horizontally arranged, and parallel,Which canbe tilted so as to admitPrecisely the desired light or air."            We were allher friends, Maggie, and Bill, and Anne,And I, and the nice Boston Brahminelderly manNamed Duncan, utterly friendly and benign.And of course it wasn'twhether or not the worldWas benign but whether it looked at her too much.Shewasn't 'painfully shy' but just the same I wouldn't be surprised if there hadbeenPainfulness in her shyness earlier on,Say at dancing school. Like others,though, she hadSurvived her childhood somehow. Nor do I meanShe was unhappy.Maybe more or less soBefore her marriage. One had the sense of tripsArranged,committees, concerts, baffled courage            Living it through, givingit order and style.And one had the sense of the late marriage as ofTwobafflements inventing the sense they made Together. The marriage seemed, to theoutside world,And probably was, radiant and triumphant,And I think that onecould almost certainly sayThat during the last, heroic, phase of things,Afterhis death, and after the stroke, she hadBy force of character and carefulmanagement,Maintained a certain degree of happiness.            The books there on thebookshelves told their stories,Line after line, all of them evenly spaced,Andspaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.In one of the booksDr. Johnson told the story:"In the scale of being, wherever it begins,Or ends,there are chasms infinitely deep;Infinite vacuities ... For surely,Nothing canso disturb the passions, or Perplex the intellects of man so much,As thedisruption of this union withVisible nature, separation from allThat hasdelighted or engaged him, a changeNot only of the place but of the mannerOf hisbeing, an entrance into a state Not simply which he knows not, but perhapsAstate he has not faculties to know."            The dinner was delicious,fresh greens, and reds,And yellows, produce of the season due,And fish from thenearby sea; and there were alsoAshes to be eaten, and dirt to drink.
