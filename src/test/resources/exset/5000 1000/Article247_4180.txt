                                 Reformulated                        I don't totally agree with you, Sarah--there are some formulas insight. What diminished Three Kings for me was that at heart it was a"conversion" melodrama in which a cynical, amoral, Bogartish hero finally can'tlive with himself in the face of injustice and opts to "do the right thing" atconsiderable personal cost. That's one of the great movie plots, but it doesn'tfeel as fresh as the rest of what's on screen. Elsewhere, however, it's the waythat screenwriters and directors bend and twist formulas that accounts for the"anything goes" quality that we've all been responding to. The beauty of TheLimey is that it takes a pretty standard pulp formula--wronged gangsterturned vigilante avenger--and creates what amounts to an essay on the idea of"distance": from other people, from the effects of our own actions in the past,and from ourselves. The villain turns out not to be a person but a concept. Yousee that not just at the end but in the middle, when Peter Fonda--a superb,non-star performance that supports your thesis, Sarah, about the subordinationof ego in many of today's most interesting actors--registers terror at thethought that it's all "getting too close" to him. It's the hero's willfulblindness to the fact that his behavior in the past had rippling consequencesthat has brought about his daughter's death.            Meanwhile, there are a zillion formulas in the wonderful Dogma , butthey're all rearranged--and then held in place--by Kevin Smith's passion.Election is a reworking of What Makes Sammy Run? --the replacementof "Sammy Glick" with "Tracy Flick" gives the game away--but told in a way thatmakes more (or more modern) sense: Its hero--unlike Budd Schulberg's--doesn'tremain the voice of moral authority; his envy, self-hatred, and displaced lustmakes him self-destruct in spectacular fashion. My larger point is that it'sdoubtful we'll escape formulas--especially with executives and would-bescreenwriters flocking to courses by Robert McKee and others. The morerealistic hope is that filmmakers will use the technology to deconstruct thoseformulas before our eyes--in ways that remind us what was vital about them tobegin with.            I'd like to follow up, Sarah, on your question about the decade's bigthemes. In June, DanielMenaker wrote a fascinating article here in                   Slate                on what hasshaped up as a Hollywood trend of the '90s. Using The Truman Show ,The Matrix , Notting Hill , and a score of other films, he citedscenarios in which the heroes--whose lives are swamped by technology andmedia--must "break through into the real." Truman must leave the studio/world,Julia Roberts must escape the cameras (ditto Ed in EDTV ), the kids inPleasantville are stuck in a "TV artifice of life and must break throughit in order to get back to their real existences." Menaker goes on: "What maybe new ... is the role that technology and the media play in these productionsas existential villains, depriving people of their 'real lives.' " (ConsiderThe Insider --mysteriously named the year's best movie by the L.A. FilmCritics--in this light.)            I don't think that theme is going to go away. As our culture becomes moreand more private--as video replaces movies the way movies replaced theater, ase-exchanges replace phone calls the way phone calls replaced talking over theback fence--we might find that our most powerful relationships are with figuresin movies and television and our own fantasy lives. "Breaking through into thereal" might not be so simple.            P.S.: Oh, one other thing, I strongly dispute the comparison to 1974. Idon't have a video guide handy but wasn't that the year of Godfather II ,Mean Streets , and one or another great Altman picture ( The LongGoodbye ?). I don't see the same kind of ambitions in this year's films, andI don't see any outright "masterpieces." Let's just say that this has been agreat year, a reversal of so much that happened in movies in the '80s. Butwe're not back to 1974 yet.
