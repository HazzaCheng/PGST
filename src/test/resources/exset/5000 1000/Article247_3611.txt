                                 The Cultural Contradictions of Celebration                        Dear Witold,            I hear what you're saying about being skeptical while also takingCelebration seriously. I've tried to do the same in writing about the place,for while I think Celebration is a flawed experiment with insidiousimplications, I also think that Disney was adventurous to try it, and that thearchitects and planners Disney employed to make it a reality are in thrall to aworthy ideal. I might accuse them of being pernicious tools of Satan (well, OK,Disney), but I wouldn't be so disrespectful as to dismiss them lightly ordiscredit (all of) their motives. Now, the same for books: I give just aboutanyone high marks for writing one, and I hate to see any author misreadcavalierly, as so regularly happens.            Living in a town so as to write about it can be a soul-twisting commitmentfor a writer, requiring a simultaneous existence as neighbor and spy, friendand infidel. For taking on that task, all three of these writers deserve kudos.All the more reason why I hate to see Ross dismissed, when to my mind his bookis not only more fun to read, it is also more ambitious and, Kurt Andersennotwithstanding, better reported.            Ross' book is not parallel to Celebration, U.S.A. It is a complementto it. It takes the same year, same town, same questions, and many of the sameevents, and hunts for their meaning in a very different direction. Frantz andCollins, with their solid (if seemingly cut-and-paste) history and assiduousdiary of whose kid beat up whose, etc., stay within the perimeter ofCelebration, within what Ross calls the White Vinyl Fence. Ross, to theapparent consternation of some reviewers but to my relief, strays beyond it.You say Frantz and Collins have done the relevant homework, but theirinterviews with Michael Eisner, Robert A.M. Stern, and others among the seminalthinkers, funders, and power brokers who brought Celebration to pass, didn'tseem to draw those thinkers very deep into the matters that make Celebration anexperiment worth writing about. Ross seems to have engaged them a bit more inthat regard.            The advantage of Ross' exploration is that he doesn't buy the conceit thatCelebration is a world apart. He makes it a part of the world, an actor in alarger ecology. This can be through the natural incursions of alligators intothe town's artificial lake and encephalitis-bearing mosquitoes onto its iconicporches. Or more significant, it can involve the human machinery behind thebuilding of the town. Ross notes how the ransom that Disney paid to OsceolaCounty for the favor of being exempt from providing low-income housingassistance within Celebration was eaten up by theme-park employees who couldnot afford to live in Celebration on a Disney wage. He notes that, in localreal estate terms, Celebration was not the anti-sprawl incentive that the NewUrbanists imagined but rather a beachhead for an expansion of suburban tractdevelopment. And more than Frantz and Collins, Ross explores the significancethat makes Celebration not just another Columbia or Reston or Hershey orPullman: its corporate sponsorship of a community in an age when corporationsand governments are shuffling and re-dealing the cards of civic responsibility,in what Ross calls "a consumer society's rendition of the concerns of thefounding fathers."            This is where Disney is more than just an irresistible candle to the mothsof snarky social critique. Disney was uniquely positioned to foster thepreeminent attempt at a neotraditional town--no one else had the pocketbook,interest, and reputation. But Disney was also uniquely burdened--because itsparks were magnets for the Orlando sprawl that Celebration is meant to correctand because the Disney company is a historically anti-democratic institutionwhose imposition of civic virtue in Celebration relies to some extent onauthoritarian principles, principles at odds with the American charter itstraditional house faades are calculated to evoke. This is extraordinary. Thepeople at Disney find it extraordinary, the people in love with Disney whoflocked to buy houses in Celebration find it extraordinary, and thankfully,Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins and Andrew Ross find it extraordinary,too, enough so to warrant spending a year of their lives there. Do you trulyfind Celebration unexceptional, except in its halo of Disney-engenderedexpectations?
