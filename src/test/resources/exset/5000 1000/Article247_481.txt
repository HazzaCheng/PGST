                                 Not Your Father's Guzzmobile                           USAToday leads with the Dept. of Justice's attempt to have Microsoft heldin contempt because the company is allegedly flouting the recently issued courtorder requiring it to market its Web browser Internet Explorer separately fromits Windows 95 operating system. The Washington Post leads with news that GM and Ford are readyto roll out the cleanest-running-ever gasoline-powered cars. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the Clinton administration's decision to open the wayto full-scale trade between the U.S. and Vietnam. The New York Timeslead is that the New York City Council has passed the nation's toughestrestrictions on outdoor cigarette advertising.            According to the WP lead, Ford and GM say they could put their newgeneration of clean gas-powered cars on the road soon provided they gotguarantees the cars would qualify as acceptable under the pollution standardseverywhere in the country outside California. (The cars are said to eliminate99 percent of smog-producing emissions, but California has adopted eventualzero-admissions standards.) But much to the companies' chagrin, New York andMassachusetts have adopted requirements similar to California's and their fearis that other states will follow suit. The story quotes unidentified EPAofficials saying that the automakers' proposals offer an acceptable compromise,which will produce cleaner air.            The LAT lead states that economic normalization between the U.S. andVietnam will result from the administration's decision, based on its view thatVietnam's emigration policies have improved considerably, to grant Vietnam awaiver from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which bars full economic relationswith Communist countries that don't permit free emigration. This will unblock avariety of government-backed financing programs for the Vietnam projects ofvarious American companies. It would have been helpful if the story had saidhigh up in what respects Vietnam's emigration stance has improved, and had alsoexplained how it is that the president can alter a country's trade status likethis unilaterally, without Senate approval.            The WP and LAT front pages carry news of the decision by NewJersey to allow gay partners to jointly adopt children on the same basis asmarried couples, the first state to do so. (The NYT runs the storyinside.) The WP story includes these factoids: between eight andthirteen million children nationwide are being raised by gay parents, while twostates, New Hampshire and Florida, bar the adoption of children by gays.                           USAT reports that yesterday, President Clinton signed the first lawdirectly cracking down on unauthorized distribution in cyberspace ofcopyrighted material even if there is no profit sought. The piece suggests thatthe new law addresses the case of a large corporate interest being abused by alone-wolf operator. But does it also address cases where it's thecorporation that's doing the stealing? Like a magazine's putting anarticle on its Web site for which one-time print rights only had been purchasedfrom a freelance writer? Or if its online archives contained plagiarizedmaterial? The story doesn't say.            The WP "Politics" column reports that Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep.John Linder recently sent out a letter titled "In Praise of Soft Money" to theFortune 500 CEOs, which described soft money as "entirely legal, ethical,beneficial and necessary to our nation's healthy two-party system."            The WP states that in Japan, more than 700 viewers of a televisioncartoon show were taken to hospitals, many suffering from seizures andunconsciousness, after viewing a sequence in the show containing strobeeffects. Jay Leno explained last night why network executives are so concerned:TV isn't supposed to cause brain damage that fast.            The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. Postal Serviceplans to issue a philanthropy stamp next year that will depict a beepollinating a flower and will bear the words: "Giving and Sharing: an AmericanTradition." Guess the rights to the Pamela and Tommy Lee video weren'tavailable.
