                                 Speak Roughly to Your Little Boy            Culturebox took a certain amount of heat from you, dear readers, for herpaean last week to the electronic baby sitter--television, that is--and forcalling children "annoying little buggers." Your most common reaction: "This isprecisely the defeatist type of attitude that could eventually bring thebeloved American civilization down." Your second most common reaction: "MaybeJudith Shulevich [ sic ] and people like her who think of children as'annoying little buggers' should think about sterilization." Those who didn'tadvocate voluntary tubal ligation (I hope that was what you were advocating)thought religion was in order.            Culturebox will appeal to history, that defense of scoundrels, to argue thattelevision seems a pretty harmless way to distract children, at least when youcompare it to the alternatives. Here are a few of the methods ofchild-restraint practiced by our forefathers and foremothers--many of whom werepatriotic, religious, and of high moral character: swaddling their children,depriving them of food (it was thought to keep babies quiet), tying them tochairs, and beating them severely. If infants persisted in bawling or shittingor generally irking, it could be assumed they were changelings--spawns of thedevil--in which case they were turned out of doors or killed. Children wereroutinely told horrifying tales about gruesome creatures lurking nearby, readyto devour them if they so much as left their beds. A popular technique formoral edification was taking a child to a public execution.            The tender empathy for children's every need and want that we take forgranted is little over a century old--about the same age as psychoanalysis andthe notion of child-care expertise. It is due for revision. A return toexorcism may be excessive, but there is plenty of evidence that children arehardier than previously thought (see, for instance, this essayby Judith Rich Harris, or read her book The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way TheyDo ). Besides, in the immortal words of my mother, parents are people,too. Without that acknowledgement, we may all be doomed to live life in themanner of this Culturebox reader--who lost my sympathy, I'm sorry to say, assoon as he called me Judy :                           Judy, bringing up kids is supposed to be very, very hard. Youaren't supposed to have free time. Your head should not rest worry-free on yourpillow every night. Your kid should not understand how hard you work or thesacrifices you make for her. You gave up your entitlement to these things whenyou brought another little human into the world who relies 100 percent on youfor her livelihood and education. If you're put out by bringing up kids, it'sbecause you're selfish, or lazy, or immature, or made a big mistake when youweren't prepared to handle the consequences. Go spend every waking hour withyour kids, and bitch about your hectic life in eighteen years.                                       Ahab I am: Culturebox has met Chatterbox--has put him up in herhome!--and can vouch for the likelihood of his sanguine reaction to The Blair Witch Project . Chatterbox is a manblessed with an enviably cheerful temperament. Not for him the excesses ofGothic supernaturalism or ridiculous stories of ghosts, stick figures, andthings that go bump in the night. Culturebox is admittedly, as Edgar Allan Poeonce wrote, "nervous--very, very dreadfully nervous." Whereas Chatterbox seemsto share the blissfully indifferent sensibilities of the Polynesian islanderQueequeg, celebrated thusly by Herman Melville in Moby Dick : "Savagesare strange beings; at times you do not know exactly how to take them. At firstthey are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems aSocratic wisdom ... [Queequeg] seemed entirely at his ease; preserving theutmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heardthere was such a thing as that."
