                                 House It Gonna Work?            The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with yesterday's revelation that the House-appointed"managers" of the impeachment case against President Clinton are leaningtowards conducting a full-bore trial in the Senate, complete with theexamination of witnesses. USA Today goes with the latest in a string ofencouraging crime stories: the paper's own survey of 1998 homicide statisticsshows that the total number of murders in America's ten largest cities is down12 percent compared to 1997. (The LAT front reports that the Los Angelesmurder rate has dropped 27 percent from last year, resulting in a 28-year low.)The New York Timesleads with initial government data showing that most states are in compliancewith the 1996 welfare reform requirement that 25 percent of recipients holdjobs or actively prepare to do so. The Times points out, however, thatmany states are not meeting the law's required percentage of working two-parentwelfare families and that the government statistics do not show whether welfareworkers have found good jobs.            The WP and LAT leads, as well as a NYT front-pager,report that the House managers' aggressive position puts them in conflict withSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who just the day before had come out infavor of a quick timetable that would probably preclude hearing from most ofthe scandal's key figures. And it is the Senate, the papers remind, whichcontrols how an impeachment trial will proceed. The NYT reports thatHouse managers and some House Republican aides said they were stunned andangered by Lott's disinclination to call witnesses. One is quoted as calling it"a slap in the face of the House."            The NYT says that all the House managers agree on the necessity ofwitnesses, whereas both the WP and LAT mention that one of theirnumber holds they should be called only if absolutely necessary.            The WP off-lead breaks an exclusive: A little-known national securityboutique firm called Vector, which went under last fall and whose president wasa former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is being investigated byseveral federal agencies. The company specialized in the highly secretivebusiness of acquiring foreign weapons and radars for U.S. intelligenceagencies, and the authorities are looking into irregularities surrounding someof its deals. Such as allegedly procuring missiles from North Korea thatsomehow never got into U.S. hands, and whose current whereabouts are unknown.Or, as part of a deal to procure Chinese missiles, supposedly giving Beijingsensitive technical information about the U.S. shoulder-fired Stingersurface-to-air missile. This story has some familiar elements that could giveit legs: phony paperwork to disguise weapons' true destinations and colorfulcharacters crossing back and forth between private deal-making andgovernment-sanctioned covert operations. Can you say Iran-Contra?            The papers continue to cover the apparent threshold-crossing performance ofe-commerce. The Wall Street Journal notes an obvious but unanticipatedconsequence: an upsurge in business for such non-netly concerns as the U.S.Postal Service, Federal Express and UPS.            Back to the impeachment witness-or-no-witnesses story for a beat. TheTimes is alone in observing that White House aides were "amused" by theGOP split on witnesses. The use of that word, in the absence of either director indirect quotations from aides, raises a host of issues: Were those aidesreally so unsophisticated as to reveal such a politically loaded emotion infront of a reporter? If so, then why aren't we told what the aides said? Ifnot, then shouldn't the paper back down to "seemed amused?" Or to "were said tobe amused by White House sources?" This is not trivial, because communicatingWhite House amusement is likely to have adverse political consequences forPresident Clinton, and so it seems only fair to insist that the Timesmake it clear that it's not being spun--or spinning.
