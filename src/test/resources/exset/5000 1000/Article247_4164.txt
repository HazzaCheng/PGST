                                 Heard of Any Good Scandals Lately?                        Dear Dad,            I agree with you entirely about the Times versus local newspapers. Asyou know, when we moved down to D.C. a few years ago, we thought we would savea little money and a few pounds of trash per week by getting the Timesonly on weekends. But right from the start, we went into serious Timeswithdrawal. Sure, the Washington Post is a good enough paper, and welike its local reporting, but its foreign coverage doesn't compare to theTimes , the Op-Ed page tends to counteract the effects of my morningcoffee (with the exception of the divinely cranky Michael Kelly onWednesdays--long may he rant), and the editors often seem clueless about how toput together an attractive and readable paper. They still haven't figured outthat it's a good idea to put all the high-technology features in a singleweekly section, the way the Times does. However, thanks to the Internet,I have been indulging my Times addiction for several years now withoutany additional cost or trash (it makes me wonder how many other people aredoing the same, and just how much money the Times has lost as aresult).            As you say, we're supposed to be talking about the news. But what has beenmost interesting to me about the news in the past few months is what hasnot been there, namely, scandal. It's as if the Lewinsky business wassuch a big, greasy, nauseating chunk of scandal to swallow that the politiciansand chattering classes subsequently lost their appetite for the stuff, at leasttemporarily. Before Monica, it seemed as if we had entered the age of thePermanent Floating Scandal. There always seemed to be at least three or fourstacked up over Washington at any one time, like planes waiting to land atNational Airport: Whitewater, Travelgate, the FBI files, the campaign-financescandals, not to mention the extra, auxiliary scandals around half the cabinet.Since Iran-Contra, it's seemed as if there's been scarcely a week in which someWashington scandal didn't hit the front page of the Times or thePost , with the reporters dropping hopeful hints about there being MuchMore to Come, and how this might all ultimately Bring the President Down.            But since the Much More came, and several additional, large, indigestiblehelpings on top of it (and still the president didn't fall!), it's as if thepress and the politicians have gone on a scandal diet, sneaking in only anoccasionally guilty snack like Newt Gingrich's mistress. Ironically, Clinton'slast two years in office seem certain to be more free of scandal than Bush's orReagan's. And along with the demise of the special prosecutor, the tone of thecoverage has changed. I certainly haven't seen much recently of the prestigemedia's dreadfully sententious hand-wringing along the lines of "Should we bedignifying with our attention these allegations about presidential fondling, asdetailed in the following 62-page special report (and make sure not to miss theamazing revelations from the alleged victim's college roommate about herattitudes toward oral sex!)." Instead, the tone has been prettystraightforwardly condemnatory in regard to excess prosecutorial zeal andprurient exposures of private life. Still, this is an eminently self-correctingsituation. The longer Washington remains without its traditional appetite forscandal, the more careless powerful people will get, and eventually one of themwill get blown up in a big, juicy affair which will have the politicians andpundits joyfully going off the diet and gorging on all the sordid details.            Of course, as our sainted editor here at                   Slate               , MichaelKinsley, has often said, the real scandal is not what's illegal, but what'slegal and going on all the time. Do you think there's any chance that themedia's temporary diet will encourage more reporters to look at this other kindof scandal, instead of dreaming about being the next Bob Woodward?            Well, I see I've gotten to the end of my page and a half, and haven'tgotten to the news, either (like father, like son?). So why don't youbegin? Any thoughts on Chechnya? John McCain?            Love,David
