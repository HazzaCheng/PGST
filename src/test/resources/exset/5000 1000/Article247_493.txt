                                 Send in the Clones            President Clinton's proposal to expand Medicare coverage leads at USA Today andthe New York Timesand is the top national story at the Los AngelesTimes and Washington Post .            The dailies report that Clinton is aiming to make Medicare available tothose retiring at 62 and even to workers as young as age 55 who find themselveswithout company health insurance. The administration claims the expansion willpay for itself through increased user fees. The NYT says this representsanother incremental step toward providing health insurance to all Americans,part of the piecemeal strategy Clinton adopted after the failure of hiscomprehensive health care reform. The WP says it's the largest expansionof Medicare in a quarter century, and notes that an enthusiastic supporter, thechief lobbyist for AARP, dismisses cost-based objections by commenting thatuntil recently everybody thought there was a budget deficit too. (This is aform of argument you can bet you will now hear again and again, in all sorts ofcontexts.)            When everybody does the same story you get to compare headlines. Theclearest and most succinct is USAT 's "Clinton: Expand Medicare."            The LAT runs a top-of-the-front photo of survivors of a massacre inAlgeria last weekend and the USAT off-lead gives some of the details:villagers are abandoning their homes to avoid the viscious attacks by Moslemextremists that have killed more than 1,200 people just this week--on top ofsome 75,000 such murders since 1992. Incredibly, reports USAT , U.N.human rights experts have not yet traveled to Algeria to look into this.            The death of Rep. Sonny Bono draws a surprising amount of coverage.USAT dedicates its front section cover story to Bono, and both theWP and LAT put two Bono stories apiece above their folds. Onlythe NYT holds back, with only a small picture "reefer" to the inside onits front bottom.            The Post calls Bono a "respected congressman." The paper also statesthat President Clinton, who "grew up with the comedy and singing team of 'Sonnyand Cher'," credited Bono with an "astute perspective." In its secondfront-page Bono piece, the Post memorializes him as "one smart cookie"capable of "piquant clarity." But in these pieces, examples do not abound. TheLAT joins the chorus, saying that Bono "made his mark on Capitol Hill."With all due respect, what mark was that?            The Wall Street Journal "Tax Report" notes that although theAlternative Minimum Tax was originally designed to ensure that mostupper-income taxpayers fork over at least some tax, if it isn't changed in anyway, in the year 2007 it will apply to 8.4 million taxpayers, including many inthe middle class.            The USAT front reports that a Chicago scientist-entrepreneur hasraised several hundred thousand dollars towards his goal of opening afor-profit clinic that will clone babies from the genetic materials ofchildless couples. His announced goal is to produce such a pregnancy within ayear and a half. The WP carries this story inside.            Coming on the heels of Michael Kennedy's death in a similar accident, SonnyBono's death prompts a number of pieces about skiing safety. Both the WPand LAT stress that many serious skiing accidents occur in the lateafternoon, with the LAT observing that Kennedy was killed at 4:15 PM,Bono at 4:30 PM. The Post and NYT both note that despite thesedangers, far more Americans are killed bicycling. But the Times notesthat the use of ski helmets is on the rise. (Look for the Kennedy/Bono deathsto spur much talk of mandatory ski helmet laws, and look for the same sort oflibertarian resistance that has marked motorcycle helmet laws.)            The WP apparently decided that enough time had passed to entitle itto publish an article looking at the Kennedy/Bono deaths' lighter side, aboutwacky fatalities caused by trees.
