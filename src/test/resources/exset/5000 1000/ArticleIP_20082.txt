What organization?

Randy'sWrap-Up                                       One way to judge a grantprogram is to count the number of projects that but for that grant would nothave come to fruition. By this measure the MacArthur "genius grants" are afailure. Awarding much of their money to established academics, the MacArthurstend to fund those happy in their work, people who simply continue what they'vebeen doing for years, but in more stylish clothes. Another way to judge a grantprogram is to count the number of summer houses the grant recipients havebought; by this measure the MacArthurs are a triumph.                           AARParificAnswer                        Middle age is the best place to be.            Brim's associates foundthe years between 40 and 60 to be a time of well-being for most of the 8,000Americans they studied, with only 23 percent reporting a midlife crisis. Evenmenopause emerged as a less traumatic transition than is usually reported. Dr.Alice Rossi, who analyzed that data, said, "The Gail Sheehy image of themenopausal woman with sweat running down her face is just not true."
