                                 For the Greater Glory of ER                        DearMarjorie,            That Eleanor's greatness was reactivestrikes me as her saving grace. Eleanor could have been--at times was--adangerous mix of patrician self-importance, self-delusion, and imperiousness.Your casting of her manipulation of Hick as "man-like," for instance, was onthe mark. Cook is persuasive that their love affair was rich and rewarding overthe years. But at the outset, Eleanor took as her model not Bloomsbury (sexualpartnership among equals, and blah-blah-blah) but FDR and her dissolute malerelatives (having your way with the help).            Much of her do-goodery--e.g., hersnotty refusal to let White House elevator operators practice their trade ("Iknow how to run an elevator!"), her firing of all the white kitchen help on thedubious belief that white people can always find work--had zero to do with theobjects of her "solicitude" and everything to do with the greater glory ofEleanor Roosevelt. What makes Eleanor admirable, and lovable to some, is thather political ambitions did not arise purely from such a project ofself-aggrandizement. They were at least in part the reaction of a decent andthwarted person tacking out in search of love and eminence. I can't agree thatshe was a force for good, but she seems to have been a good person.            Most differences between Eleanor'sstanding and Hillary Clinton's arise from the origins of their respectivesocial consciences. When Eleanor says, as she does at one point in Volume2 , "There is nothing more exciting than building a new social order," whydon't we reply, as we have to Hillary: Who the hell elected you? And why doesChristopher Lasch's The New Radicalism in America --the classicindictment of the self-interest of the "concerned" classes, which excoriatesprogressive paternalism from Jane Addams to the Kennedy administration--leave abig hole where Eleanor should be, giving her a free pass? Because Eleanor, inher own patrician way, had behind her the authority of what our grandparentscalled the School of Hard Knocks. (And our grandparents had far more awarenessthan we grant them that such Knocks could be emotional ones.) Her ambitions arethe product of difficult and humiliating intercourse with humanity. Hillary, bycontrast, is a cosseted suburbanite with a project for getting famous. Herambitions come undiluted from her own fantasy life.            Eleanor's most visible outwardadvantages over Hillary are 1) a sense of humor and 2) a willingness to dohard, painful work. In my teens I ran across a great book of Peter Arnocartoons from The New Yorker of the 1930s that would make you laugh tillyou cried. Except for one. It showed two miners with their flashlight-helmetsstaring off into the distance, and one was saying, "Look! It's Mrs. Roosevelt."What's so funny about that? I wondered. After all, Eleanor did go down inmines. I think what was funny to contemporary readers was a) the Santa-likeubiquity of Eleanor Roosevelt and b) the unthinkability of a wealthy ladygetting her clothes dirty in a dangerous place. They're stunts, but courageousand spirited enough ones to earn you the ear of the public. Hillary frightensus because she feels no need to do any of that earning.            As an account of the blossoming ofEleanor--emotional, sexual, intellectual, political, and otherwise--this is asplendid biography. But as a political history? Cook implies that--at theheight of Stalin's terror, and years after a planned Ukrainian famine that wasarguably a genocide--those who disagreed with Eleanor and Esther Lape's questfor diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union were rustic lunkheads to a man.And I have a favorite passage from Volume 2 , concerning the difficultyin passing a constitutional amendment to ban child labor:                           State ratification wasblocked by shrieks of Bolshevism: Various church groups and opponents of publichealth, public education, and all public improvements protested the amendmentas a government intrusion into the "freedom" of familylife.                        The equation of anti-communism andopposition to "all public improvements" is bad. But the sneer-quotes aroundfreedom take the cake. None of this sinks the book. An author's ideology iskind of like the weather in a foreign country: After a few days you learn todress for it, and you can enjoy the sights without paying it much mind. Still,I'll stick with my characterization of Cook as "irresponsible."            Best,Chris
