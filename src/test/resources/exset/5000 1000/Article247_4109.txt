                                 Labor Pains            The WTO continues to dominate, leading at USA Today ,the Washington Post , and the Los AngelesTimes . The New York Timesoff-leads the story, going instead with the official start Thursday of NorthernIreland's new home-rule, power-sharing government, a story nobody else fronts.The new Cabinet met in Belfast yesterday for the first time and theTimes quotes one attendee as enthused about the personal relationshipshe saw there between former Protestant and Catholics foes. The only discordantnote was sounded by the two hard-line Protestant Cabinet members, who boycottedthe meeting and held a press conference ominously urging people not to "getcarried away about new dawns and new days having arrived in NorthernIreland."            The WP lead details much local ferment about the way the Seattle police handled theanti-WTO demonstrators and the NYT inside has an excellent up-close onsome of the self-proclaimed anarchists thought to have been responsible formuch of the violence and destruction on Seattle's streets. But the generalthrust of the WTO reporting is that with the discord outside the trade meetingpretty much subsiding, there was a chance to focus finally on the discordinside. The LAT refers to the meeting as a potential "fiasco." The mostdivisive policy point is centered on President Clinton's suggestion earlier inthe week that countries failing to meet basic labor standards might be subjectto WTO sanctions. The coverage reports that this was rejected by businessleaders, and many delegates from the European Union and developing countries,who view such standards as thinly veiled protectionism. The NYT quotes atrade minister from Pakistan as threatening to "explode the meeting" if theproposal goes forward. To further confuse things, the LAT and NYTquote Clinton administration players as saying that the official U.S. WTOnegotiation position does not include the sanction idea.            The WP reports that just prior to leaving Seattle, President Clintonsigned a bill banning extreme conditions of child labor, citing as he did sothe examples of Brazil, Pakistan, and Guatemala. But the paper doesn't explainhow any bill Clinton could sign could affect conditions overseas. TheLAT does: What Clinton signed was a U.N.-sanctioned internationaltreaty. This too, the paper adds, was a cause of upset, with developing nationdelegates pointing out that the U.S. has been generally laggard in endorsingother international labor codes.            Everybody fronts last night's GOP presidential candidates' debate (not theright word, since, as the papers point out, there was no candidate-to-candidatequestioning), the first one to include George W. Bush. The coverage views theevening as focusing most of its energy on testing Bush, especially on taxes andforeign policy. Verdict: No major gaffes. But both the WP and NYTseem most charmed by John McCain--they get a kick out of reporting on hisanswer to the question, "Would you reappoint Alan Greenspan?" If the Fedchairman were to die, McCain said, "I would do like they did in the movieWeekend at Bernie's . I would prop him up and put a pair of darkglasses on him."            A difference of style is on display for readers of the NYT andWP stories about Bill Bradley's responses to Al Gore's recentcharacterizations of the Bradley platform. The Times story is slugged,"BRADLEY REBUTS GORE ON HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY," while the Postopts for "GORE LIES REPEATEDLY, BRADLEY SAYS."            The Wall Street Journal flags high in its front-page businessnews box word that the Justice Department has hired a Wall Street investmentbanker as a financial adviser in the Microsoft case. Despite DOJ protestationsotherwise, the paper sees this as a signal that the government might becontemplating a sweeping restructuring of Microsoft. At the very least, thepaper suggests, the company is viewing the move as opening round saber-rattlinggoing into the settlement talks.            Rabbi Michael Lerner, briefly a Friend of Hillary early in the first Clintonadministration, is featured on the LAT op-ed page making the stretchiestpitch yet for the WTO protesters. They are, explains Lerner, fighting the "samebattle that Jews will celebrate by lighting candles for eight days, startingtonight." Another ex-Clintonite, Dick Morris, explains to the WP 's"Reliable Source" that "Hillary's Senate campaign is Bill Clinton's 'I'm sorry'gift. This is his marital comeback strategy. If she runs for Senate, she'llneed him to raise money. If she runs, she'll lose. If she loses, she'll needhim. But if she wins, she'll divorce him."
