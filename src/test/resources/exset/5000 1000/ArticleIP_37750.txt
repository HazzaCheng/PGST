                                 Voting Online                           First of two parts                        Nextweek, Jodi Kantor will report on the emergence of Internet voting and some ofthe obstacles to it, the most daunting of which is ballot security. But let'sassume for the moment that the practical problems can be overcome. WillInternet voting be good news for American democracy?            Thechief argument for e-voting is that it will cause more people to vote. Aseveryone knows, turnout has been declining. In presidential elections, it hasfallen from 63 percent of the voting-age population in 1960 to less than 50percent in 1996. There are many reasons for this, but one of them is surely theinconvenience of casting ballots in person. Before you can vote, you need tohave registered, often several weeks before an election. Then you must gosomewhere and stand in a line--on a day that seems scientifically chosen tomaximize the odds of lousy weather. If you're going to be away from home onElection Day, you have to think ahead about getting an absentee ballot.E-voting would eliminate these hassles. Some advocates believe that it wouldhave its greatest impact on participation by voters aged 18-24, who turn out inlower numbers than any other group.            On theother side are a variety of objections. In addition to concerns about fraud,some argue that Internet voting would accentuate the socio-economic skew of ourelections. Wealthier, whiter people are more likely to vote than poor peopleand minorities. Since they're also more likely to own personal computers,online voting might exaggerate the disparity. There is also an argument thatthe familiar process of voting in person serves a civic purpose. Rick Valelly,a professor at Swarthmore College, argued  in the New Republic recently that realvoting is a "vital public ritual that increases social solidarity and bindspeople together." You might call this the communitarian objection. Valellythinks that e-voting would create "political anomie."            Ithink it's fairly easy to answer the race-and-class argument. No one thinksthat e-voting would replace r-voting any time soon. So long as it is anoptional alternative, e-voting makes it easier for some people tovote--especially the handicapped, people living abroad, and frequentflyers--without inconveniencing anyone else. This is what's called a win-winsituation. Over the next decade, access to the Internet is forecast to becomedirt cheap and quasi-ubiquitous. But for those who still can't afford or don'twant private access at home, there will be public Internet terminals inlibraries, schools--and probably grocery stores and bus stations as well.E-voting might actually be a boon to the poor, who often can't miss work tovote as easily as higher-income types can.            Thecommunitarian objection is a bit more troubling. Around the world, peoplestruggle and die for the right to vote, just as people in this country oncedid. If you've ever seen the once-disenfranchised standing in line all day tocast the first ballot of a lifetime in South Africa or Guatemala, it's hard notto be appalled at how cavalierly people treat voting in this country. It'stempting to say that anyone unwilling to sacrifice an hour to exercise theright to vote doesn't much deserve it. Having to take a bit of trouble to votereminds you that voting is the cornerstone of all our rights. By eliminatingthe ritual, e-voting stands to diminish the meaning attached to it.            I'dsay that this complaint is valid but not persuasive. The chief value of theritual of voting is to convey the significance of voting to democraticcitizens. Once the ritual becomes a deterrent to the act itself, as it prettyclearly has, it ceases to serve its purpose. In the end, the communitarianobjection to e-voting seems more aesthetic than substantive. On the Internet,more of us will exercise our right and fulfill our civic responsibilities. Wejust won't meet in a church basement to do it. The trade-off of higherparticipation for poorer visuals would seem one well worth making.            In fact, e-voting is lessof a leap than it might seem. When you think about it, voting has long been afusion of public and private, of tradition and technology. The secret ballotwas a Progressive Era reform. Voting machines--which utilize primitive, punchcard computer processing--came into widespread use in the 1960s. These twoinnovations mean that we already vote privately by computer--we just visit apublic place to do so. It's not that nothing will be lost when we all vote fromremote terminals instead of at the local polling place. But what we stand tolose is ephemeral. What we stand to gain from virtual voting is very real.
