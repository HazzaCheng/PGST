Wednesday's Question(No. 328)--"Hello, Wieners":                                                         A study by the Department of Health and Human Services showsthat kids are four times as likely to do it on Halloween as on any otherevening. Do what?                                       "Turnoff the television and go outside."-- Neal Pollack ( Peter Carlinhad a similar answer.)

Randy's Wrap-Up                        Many responses remark on our sedentary youth,barely able to leave the couch, let alone the house, sedated by the television,the Nintendo, the ennui, the Quaaludes. Budget cuts have eliminated sportsprograms in many urban schools. And bicycles, once the vigorous instruments ofsuburban freedom, are rarely spotted in the playground; parents fear for theirkids in heavy suburban traffic. Most bicycles are now sold to adults, all toooften wearing ill-advised spandex pants.            Another HHS study citesthe immobilizing effect of the car. A report on the increased rate of obesityin America (from 1 in 8 in 1991 to 1 in 5 last year) shows the biggestincrease--67.2 percent--in the South, with a hefty 101.8 percent gain inGeorgia. The cause: not grits, cars. Atlanta's sprawl keeps people sitting intheir cars for hours, encouraging them to eat fatty fast food and run down kidswho, bloated and logy from their indoor lifestyle, bike-less and slow,staggering along on foot, slowed by 35-pound backpacks, make easy targets and asickening sort of "squish" sound. It's like dodge ball, but with an actualDodge.                           Screech of Batsand Brakes Answer                        On Halloween, kids arefour times as likely to be fatally struck by a car. Trick? Treat? The study isa little vague in its conclusions.

Russ Johnson, amateur pinball historian, reactsto the news that WMS Industries is shutting down its assembly line, leavingStern Pinball as the last manufacturer of the beloved game. (But go ahead andmake up an Atlanta Braves joke if you like.)            2. Bohdan Krawchenko, a Ukrainian democraticactivist, is dismayed at his country's rigged presidential elections. (Note totranslator: What is Ukrainian for "shenanigans"?)            3. A Fox executive is disappointed with the waytheir new shows look on television. No, wait. I'm wrong. It's a letter-writerto the New York Times who's having trouble with his organic carrots.(Probable cause: The "wonderful world of the carrot rust fly." Prognosis:excellent.)            4. A U.S. senator is disgusted by his colleagues.Or perhaps Times columnist Martin Arnold thinks a lot of books are justtoo darned big. (And on a personal note, it's just so sad when any lump isneglected. I think that's the message of that new Meryl Streep movie where sheplays a heroic violin teacher.)            5. Another American hashad it with his HMO. Or an unnamed beverage industry executive hatesCoca-Cola's plan to put temperature sensors in its vending machines toautomatically raise the price of a Coke on hot days. (But he wasn't so snippyabout my plan to affix temperature sensors to Meryl Streep.)                           CommonDenominator                        Razor blades.
