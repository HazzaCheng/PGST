                                  Make Love Not War            The true irresponsibilityof Kenneth Starr and the Republicans in Congress who turned an innocent affairinto a national crisis is only now becoming clear. Yes, our 13 monthdistraction is now over, and the media can return to discussing educationreform and Social Security as they claim to prefer. Yes, Bill Clinton was notevicted from office. But that doesn't mean our long national nightmare is over.In fact, it is just beginning.            Already there are hintsof the trouble ahead. In the past year, our former-peacenik president haslaunched missile attacks on Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein at the oddest oftimes. The surest-footed politician of our era held a crass partisan pep rallysmack in the middle of the impeachment process. And on the eve of his acquittalin the Senate, he allegedly let slip that his next major policy initiative isretaliating against impeachment foes. The White House strongly denies the lastitem. But let's face it: It fits a pattern.            Despite the indignant denials of the president's pursuers,we're about to discover that Flytrap is indeed about sex. Or at least that thepost-Flytrap era is going to be about lack of sex. Now that it's permissible totalk about such matters, some big questions arise: With whom is the presidenthaving sexual relations? (Or, to use Clinton's brilliant euphemism, "not havingsexual relations.") When was the last time? Is he getting any at all?            This is serious stuff.The president, a k a "the most powerful man in the world," (and this one isknown for his large appetite, to boot) has been collared. Charismatic, suffusedwith Henry Kissinger's ultimate aphrodisiac, and looking fitter than ever, ourpresident nevertheless faces odds of scoring that have to be slimmer thanBeavis' or Butt-Head's.            Consider the obvious. Hillary. Long-suffering, yes. But areturn to the crime scene any time soon? Doubtful. Out of respect for the firstlady, enough said. Any other candidates? Equally doubtful. With all eyes on thepresident, both inside and outside the White House, where is there even atrysting place, now that the Oval Office has been discovered? And wouldClinton, hanging so tenuously to his legacy, risk what's left by working backchannels with the Secret Service to bring in concupiscent conscripts whileHillary's out of town? Well, one hesitates to say with certainty that thisparticular president ever learns from experience on this particular subject,but surely, surely , at this point ... after all that's happened ...knowing what's at stake. Well, I guess the most we can say is: probablynot.            So, outside of some safephone sex, it's a reasonable bet to conclude that the most powerful man in theworld has to be, well, testy. And if so, that sure explains a lot. Missilestrikes against his enemies. Hello, Dr. Freud. James Carville, his personifiedid, declaring war on political foes. This isn't rational behavior. It's morebefitting a hormonally unbalanced teenager who is acting out.            This is very different from the Wag the Doghypothesis. The president isn't engaging in military action to distract publicattention from his sexual activity. He's engaging in military action todistract himself from his lack of sexual activity.            And the notion of a hormonally unbalanced nationalleader, with the world's most powerful arsenal and fighting forces at hiscommand, is profoundly frightening.            What to do? First, as anation, we must accept that our very human and virile president has very humanand virile needs that aren't being met. Denial is not an option. Believe me,I've run this by a high-school "health education" teacher. Second, rechannelingthis energy has its limits. Clinton can save Social Security, protect theenvironment, improve public schooling, and help elect Al Gore but, at the endof the day, the problem hasn't gone away.            Third, we need to cut the president some slack. If thefirst lady's job description no longer includes being first, then let's lobbyto create a new post, the last lady--or the latest lady. Unconstitutional? Thenhow about more conventional remedies? Road trips. Prostitution is legal inVegas. Or how about offshore R & R? Visit Subic Bay Naval station, rallythe troops, or salute their memory, whatever, as long as there's time foroff-base socializing.            One way or another, the president's needs must beministered to (to borrow another terrific Flytrap euphemism). We will all sleepbetter at night knowing that our commander in chief's libido iscompartmentalized, and that he's not bombing Sudanese pharmaceutical plantsjust to get his Iraqs off.
