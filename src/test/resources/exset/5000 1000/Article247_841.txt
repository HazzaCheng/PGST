                                 Defensive End            When will Kenneth Starr end his prosecution of President Clinton? No timesoon, reports the New York Times lead. With conviction by the Senateunlikely, Starr now contends that the president can legally be indicted whilehe still holds office. His indictment could remain under secret seal, and atrial would almost certainly be postponed until his term expires in 2001. Theunnamed sources ("associates" of the independent counsel) also allege thatStarr's decision to indict will be unaffected by the outcome of the Senatetrial. The LosAngeles Times leads with the White House's furious reaction: "Somebodyought to tell [Starr] he's not the 101st senator."            The Times story reiterates that Starr doesn't consider his mandate atall eroded by public disapproval: "Prosecutors do not take polls to decide whatto do," insists one source. The LAT and the Washington Post front the latest of these poll results: theLAT reports that 49% of Americans favor censure, and 46% think thecharges should be dropped altogether (what do the other 5% want-- removal? Thepaper doesn't say). The Post poll is less dramatic, finding that 60% ofrespondents support censure but 33% support conviction and removal. Afront-page news analysis in the Post explains how historical vanitycould induce both parties in the Senate to unite around censure. Censuring thePresident would make Republican senators look firm and responsible but alsopragmatic and unpetty. And censure would let Democrats distance themselves fromthe tawdriness of the President's misdeeds while still preserving the requisitemodicum of party loyalty.            The Post reports inside that conservative activist Gary Bauer willannounce his nascent Presidential candidacy on this morning's talk showcircuit. Bauer is a formidable fundraiser with an extensive grassrootsnetwork-- in the last election cycle, over 90,000 supporters pledged an averageof $35 to his PAC. Bauer's hero is Ronald Reagan; but without the buzz of anational reputation, he'll be lucky to get as many votes as Pat Buchanan.Another story inside the WP describes how Republicans legislators areattempting, Clinton-style, to appropriate issues on which their Democraticopponents are traditionally strongest. By churning out legislation supportingblock grants, local control, and parental involvement, the Republicans arehoping to re-zone education as GOP real estate.            The NYT and the Post front NATO's authorization of air strikesin Yugoslavia, to begin if the Serbian government and ethnic Albanian leadersdon't start talks on a Western-drafted peace plan by next Saturday. The talkswill take place in France, and must conclude by February 19. If a settlement isreached, NATO plans to send 30,000 peacekeeping troops to Kosovo. TheNYT reports that 2000 to 5000 of these troops would come from the U.S.;the Post puts the number as high as 7000.            The Times and the WP each front long feature stories about howInternet companies engender and monitor relationships among strangers. TheTimes reports that America Online has become a lively center ofdiscourse-sometimes too lively for the company's admittedly tame taste. AOLenlists 14,000 volunteers patrollers who delete 'offensive' messages from chatrooms and message boards and assign demerits to their authors. The companyrecently nixed a heated discussion on Northern Ireland, raising questions aboutpossible First Amendment obligations to allow open discourse. The Poststory describes the far more laissez-faire approach taken by eBay, theexplodingly popular site that allows users to barter, trade, and selleverything from pez dispensers to can openers. Even though the companyfacilitates actual commerce, it approaches regulation lightly, relying on itsusers to report on behavior deemed less than "eBaysian". However, anyone foundabusing the feedback system is instantly "vaporized" from the site. Itsfounders see eBay as a utopian online community, but angry users are calling it"an ineffectual police state, doling out random discipline without dueprocess."            The NYT Magazine cover story examines the decline and fall of theItalian Mafia in general, and the Gambino family in particular. The wiser ofthe wise guys have gone legit; the dumber ones (such as John Gotti Jr.) presideover sagging profits and faltering allegiances. Gotti sees himself as a victimof Government-led persecution, and compares Federal breakups of organized crimeto the US Government's treatment of Native Americans in the 19th century. Gottihas even tarnished the mob's Coppolaesque grandeur: the piece mocks his car (aminivan), his attire (mock turtlenecks), and choice of repast (country-friedsteak).
