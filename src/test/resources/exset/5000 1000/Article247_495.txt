                                 Solitary Men            Theodore Kaczynski's apparent suicide attempt and his renewed attempt to behis own lawyer lead at USA Today and the Los AngelesTimes . The worsening Indonesian economic crisis leads at the Washington Post and at the Wall Street Journal . The sentencing of the World TradeCenter bombing mastermind leads at the New YorkTimes .                           USAT reports that Sacramento jail authorities deduced fromKacszynski's missing underpants and a red mark on his neck that he had tried tocommit suicide in his cell the night before. (Presumably they could rule out areally hot date.) As a result, says USAT , he's been placed in apsychiatric cell where his movements will be monitored 24 hours a day while thecourt continues to ponder the issue of his legal representation.            The LAT lead says these latest Unabomber trial developmentshave left Kacszynski's mother and brother "reeling." The story also getsfront-page coverage at the NYT and WP . The NYT mentionsthat the jury was about to be sworn in but was instead "sent home" Thursday.But none of the accounts mention whether the jury is sequestered yet. If not,then the jury's been exposed to the suicide attempt, the controversy about hiscompetency, as well as to the news that the government turned down his offer toplead guilty in return for having his life spared. Won't all this tend topromote jury sympathy for Kacszynski?            The WSJ reports that concerns about Indonesia'sPresident Suharto's ability to turn things around--because he's infirm andbecause he has too many family members with fortunes to protect--have gotten sobad that on Thursday, supermarkets were jammed by those trying to stock up onessential goods.            The Journal focuses more on the crisis, the WP and NYTfocus more on what the U.S. and the IMF are doing about it. The Timeshas the most detail about the U.S. role, reporting that President Clintoninsisted in a 20-minute phone call with Suharto on Thursday night thatIndonesia must put in place strong economic reforms. The crisis is also on thefront at the LAT and USAT .            The NYT lead about the World Trade Center sentencing reports thatfederal judge Kevin Duffy sentenced Ramzi Yousef to 240 years in prison andurged that he spend it all in solitary confinement, without phone privileges.The NYT mentions that only six prisoners in the federal system have beenso confined, but leaves the reader wondering who they are and what they did.The WP gives the example of one, a New York gang leader who directedthree murders from jail. The Times makes it clear that the judge canonly recommend sentence conditions, which ultimately are determined by prisonofficials. (Although a word or two about how Duffy arrived at the 240 yearswould have been instructive.) And the Times has the detail that Yousefwas also ordered to pay a $4.5 million fine and restitution of $250 million,because, said Duffy, leaving no Oliver Stone unturned, "someday I can seesomeone being perverse enough to buy your story."            The LAT runs afront-page story based on juror interviews reporting that, contrary toopinions expressed yesterday by the Nichols jury forewoman, there was "a strongfaction" on the jury leaning towards the death penalty.            Both the WP and the NYT run stories inside reporting a newstudy concluding that 80 percent of the adults in prison are locked up becauseof criminal activity linked to drug and alcohol abuse. But the Postdoesn't address a crucial distinction: how much of the criminal activity isviolation of the drug laws and how much is something else. (A lot of the formermight be grist for legalization. A lot of the latter might be grist for thestatus quo.) But the study does apparently get into this, because theTimes reports that "alcohol, more than any illegal drug, was found to beclosely associated with violent crimes..."            It's no big deal, but the WP story about President Clinton's visit toa fund-raiser at the toney "Dakota" apartment building in New York Citymentions that John Lennon lived there and "it was outside this building wherehe was murdered in 1981." Actually, it was 1980.
