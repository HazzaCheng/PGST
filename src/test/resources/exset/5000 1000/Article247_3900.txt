                                 Caucasian Killers            The New YorkTimes , Washington Post , and USA Today all lead with the 271-156 House vote toprohibit doctor-assisted suicide--an American Medical Association-supportedbill intended to overturn an Oregon law. (Oregon voters have approved thesuicide measure twice, with majorities of 51 percent and 60 percent.) The billhas strong support in the Senate, although the Post says a Democrat is threatening to filibuster. It is unknownwhether President Clinton would sign it if passed. The Los Angeles Times ' topnon-local lead is the assassination of eight Armenian politicians--includingthe prime minister--inside the parliament chamber. This story tops theWall Street Journal 's"Worldwide" box, off-leads at the Post , goes below-the-fold at theNYT (which runs a dramatic video-still of the assassination attempt),and gets reefered by USAT .  The NYT off-leads the serious, gentlemanly debate between Al Gore and BillBradley in New Hampshire, a story fronted by the LAT and reefered(with front-page pictures) by USAT and the Post .            The three Armenian assassins shot Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian and muchof his Cabinet at close range, then took dozens of hostages. The Armenianpresident, Robert Kocharian, negotiated with the terrorists for about 10 hoursbefore the gunmen--apparently nationalists angry at the prime minister'sland-for-peace negotiations with neighboring Azerbaijan--gave themselves up.(Islamic Azerbaijan lost control of the mostly Christian territory ofNagorno-Karabakh to Armenia earlier this decade.) Sarkisian's murder came justan hour after seeing off U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott (asometime                   Slate                contributor), who was mediating the peacetalks. The Post notes that Armenia is one of the highest per-capitarecipients of U.S. foreign aid, and the negotiations with Azerbaijan are aspecial project of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.            All the papers describe the Gore-Bradley debate as an amicable affair.Wearing a brown jacket and maroon tie, Gore was more aggressive than Bradley,taking questions from the audience 20 minutes before the cameras rolled andcharging that Bradley's health-care plan would eat the entire $1 trillion (over10 years) surplus. Bradley brushed aside most of Gore's criticisms at first,then disputed then calmly later on. The Post says that Bradley passed up a questioner's invitation toattack Gore for 1996 campaign-finance abuses. (For Ballot Box's take on thedebate, click here.)            On the NYT op-ed page, former Reagan administration diplomat PaulH. Nitze argues that America should unilaterally destroy its nuclearweapons. Retaliatory nuclear strikes are never justified, he argues, becausethey would kill millions of innocents. Instead, the U.S. should use itspinpoint conventional missiles to make both pre-emptive and retaliatory strikesagainst nuclear terrorists and rogue states.                           Journal editorial-board member John H. Fund opines that many of John McCain's longtime GOP associates fromArizona--many of them now less-than-adoring of the senator--could havepredicted McCain's Nixonian reaction to Monday's mildly critical NYTstory (he accused the Bush campaign of "planting" the story in theTimes to smear him; see yesterday's TP). Fundsays McCain's hypersensitivity should give pause to his acolytes in thenational media. McCain has "courage and candor," Fund writes. "But a presidentcan't rule by heroic example alone; he must build and lead a team. In light ofMr. McCain's record and reputation in Arizona [as temperamental], one must askhow effective a Lone Ranger like him would be in the White House."            The Post reports on the latest hot Internet startup: a llamaauctionsite. Run by a computer techie at NIH who moonlights as a breeder at the"Llamarada" farm in Virginia, Llamaweb.com lets you search for your woolly petby gender and personality type, and even offers a "mini-herd discount" forgroup sales. Today's Papers has taken a liking to "PHLGem Dandy," the Chilean female with the cute inky-black face, described as"suitable for use as a companion" and "very docile/willing." TP will have toask his landlord before bidding, though. (He might have to settle for thecashmere goat.)
