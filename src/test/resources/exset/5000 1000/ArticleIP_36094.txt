                                 Japanese Cultural Fallout                           AsahiShimbun blames last week's uranium accident in Tokaimura on misguidedJapanese cultural values. "In the United States, technical association codes ofethics put the greatest emphasis on protecting public safety, health andwelfare. Loyalty to employers is fourth on the list. Quite probably theTokaimura accident could have been avoided if just one person among thosetechnicians, company executives and bureaucrats had applied such a philosophy."Despite admissions that the plant had flouted government-approved guidelinesfor the handling of uranium and comments reported in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post from Western scientists that"safety practices in Japan are 'a bit lax,' " the Japanese government restatedits commitment to commercial generation of nuclear power Tuesday.            Theseizure last week of the Myanmar (Burma) Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, bypro-democracy protestors "achieved precious little to advance the cause of thehobbled pro-democracy movement in that benighted country," the Straits Times ofSingapore said in an editorial. The gunmen demanded that the Myanmar militaryregime release its political prisoners and start a dialogue with dissidentleader Aung San Suu Kyi, and that the parliament elected in 1990 be allowed toconvene. Although the demands were not met, the 89 hostages taken at theembassy were released unharmed, and the gunmen were allowed to escape."Myanmar, arguably one of the world's harshest military regimes, is bound tocrack down even harder on political dissidents after what happened," the paperargued, adding that Burmese dissidents could now lose their safe haven inThailand since the sympathetic Thai government cannot be seen to supportterrorist groups. The editorial encouraged Asian governments to press Myanmarto break its stalemate. It concluded, "It is far better that the militaryregime drops its state of siege and deal with Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, who espousesnon-violent principles, than let the situation fester."            TheSydney MorningHerald reported Tuesday that the head of the peacekeeping forces inEast Timor had called on pro-independence guerrillas to give up their weapons.An editorial in Wednesday's SMH said, "In the overallinterests of peace and stability, Interfet [the international force in EastTimor] must have a monopoly of force for the foreseeable future." Admittingthat it will be difficult to persuade groups such as Falintil to disarm whileIndonesian troops remain, the paper said, "When the last Indonesian soldier hasleft East Timor, the rationale for the guerillas remaining a fighting forcewill be gone as well. It is then that Falintil should hand over itsweapons."            At theannual Conservative Party conference in Britain, former Prime Minister MargaretThatcher made what the conservative Times called a "jingoistic" speech blaming allBritain's problems in the last 60 years on continental Europe."[I]n my lifetimeall our problems have come from mainland Europe and all the solutions have comefrom the English-speaking nations of the world that have kept law-abidingliberty alive for the future," Thatcher said. A party spokesman told theTimes the flap was a "storm in a teacup ... in her lifetime World WarTwo and the Soviet Union have been the major threats to Britain." An op-ed inthe same paper said that whereas Thatcher's legacy has proved "positive" forthe Labor Party, for the Tories it has been "little short of catastrophe." Oncethe luster fades from the current Labor government, the column said, theConservatives "had better be standing in the centre ground. For if, when peopleturn around to look afresh at this strange anachronism called the ConservativeParty, they find it where Labour wants it to be--clinging to Thatcher's skirtson the far Right--they will simply turn straight back to Labour."            LinoOviedo, who fled to Argentina in March after he was accused of involvement inthe assassination of Paraguay's vice president, was exiled to a remotePatagonian island last week for violating the terms of his asylum, reports theBuenos AiresHerald . Oviedo, who had agreed not to make political pronouncements,broke his pledge by declaring that he should be running Paraguay. Now fromTierra del Fuego he's complaining that the harsh climate might endanger hisrecent hair transplant. A Herald editorial said, "Theargument that his hair implant needs more time to take root was not onlylegally flimsy but also highly unbecoming for his rugged martial profession andhis tough guy image." More berugged than rugged, perhaps.
