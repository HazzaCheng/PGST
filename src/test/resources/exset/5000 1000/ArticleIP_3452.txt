                                 <I>Private Parts</I>                           (Note: "Life andArt" is an occasional column that compares movies with the lives they're basedon.)                        Toward the beginning ofPrivate Parts , a heavily made-up Howard Stern, playing himself as acollege student, explains in a voice-over that to enjoy the movie, "you've gotto suspend disbelief." Exactly how much disbelief does this biopic require usto suspend?            Not allthat much, actually. Private Parts may be hyperbolic, but it basicallyadheres to the facts, at least as they are laid out in Stern's memoir, alsocalled Private Parts (1993); in interviews; and in an unauthorizedbiography, Howard Stern: King of All Media , by Newsday reporterPaul D. Colford. Stern grew up on Long Island, went to Boston University, andworked at stations in Westchester, N.Y.; Hartford, Conn.; Detroit; andWashington, D.C., before making it in New York City. Along the way, he droppedhis fake-sounding FM voice and became a "shock jock," talking more and moreabout himself, sex, sex with his wife, etc. The movie does gloss over thelengths Stern was willing to go to shock. In the movie, his racial comedy tendstoward the mildly offensive (he invents a militant black traffic announcer). Inhis book, he writes of Rodney King, "They didn't beat this idiot enough." Onthe air, he encouraged police to shoot at rioters during the uproar in LosAngeles. He's talked about having sex to "Negro race music," and he's asked hismother on the air if she "got on all fours" during sex, and if she was a"three-input woman."            On-screen, Stern says he's remained faithful tohis wife--and by all accounts, that is true. On-screen, Stern's penchant forexposing the details of his marriage strains it somewhat. That was also thecase in real life. In the movie, Stern kisses and consoles a pregnant Alisonwhen she complains, "I look like a house." In his memoir, however, Sternwrites: "I find nothing attractive about the pregnant form. I'm like Elvis. Ifa girl got pregnant, he couldn't go near her."            In themovie, Stern's rise to the top is impeded by villainous, scotch-swillingnetwork executives. Were his bosses at WNBC really that bad? In real life,Stern definitely tangled with the station heads. The movie's main meanie, "PigVomit," is a composite of several oppressive managers, based most heavily onKevin Metheny (a program manager nicknamed "Pig Virus" by Stern). But Sternalso had what he terms a "savior" in then general manager Randall Bongarten,who doesn't figure in the movie. Randy would occasionally tell Stern to watchhis content (he advised against a Bestiality Dial-a-Date routine, forexample), but he also promoted Stern's career. Among other things, Bongartenarranged for advertisements in which Stern (WNBC's afternoon-drive deejay) andDon Imus (the station's morning-drive star) got equal billing. In the film,Imus won't deign to speak to Stern, much less appear in an ad with him.            However, in 1985, NBC executives did instructBongarten to fire Stern. Colford writes in his biography that Howard haselevated "the final chapter in his war with NBC" to the "myth of the inventiveradio personality clashing with the stuffed shirts of a mighty network," butgoes on to record events that sound a lot like stuffed shirts clashing withStern: Bob Rukeyser, NBC's director of corporate communications at the time,said that he alerted Grant Tinker, then chairman of NBC, to Stern's material,and that Tinker decided Stern had to go.            Sternreached No. 1 in New York City during morning drive (the most competitive timeperiod) in the fall of 1991, but at a station that does not appear inPrivate Parts : WXRK-FM (92.3 K-ROCK), owned by Infinity Broadcasting.(Infinity hired Howard just months after NBC fired him.) During the film's lastscene, as Alison and Howard kiss, he explains in a voice-over that life isgood, even if the Federal Communications Commission gets on his case every nowand then. What he doesn't say is that, in response to mounting fines from theFCC for indecency on Stern's radio show, Infinity paid a settlement of $1.7million in 1995. Nor does he mention that in the end, he did make a fewcompromises to stay on the air: Infinity instituted a seven-second delay sothat offensive portions of Howard's program could be bleeped before they werebroadcast. He was also forbidden to refer to his boss, Mel Karmazin, on theair.            SeeSlate's review of Private                Parts .
