                                 The Empire Strikes Back            The Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post lead withRussia's fiercest attack on Chechnya yet, a story the New York Timesputs inside. The Times goes instead with word that Federal TradeCommission officials have OKed the Mobil-Exxon merger.            The papers announce that Russia is pummeling Chechnya and environs with newintensity and new equipment and quote Russian threats to finish off the Chechenfighters. The LAT reads the statements the most savvily, saying theyprovide the first indication that Russia wants to annihilate, not merelyisolate, the rebels. The 100,000 Russian soldiers in the region have faced onlylight resistance so far from their 6,000 Chechen counterparts, but now Chechencommanders are threatening a counterattack. The LAT reminds readersthat in 1996, 1,500 Chechen fighters were able to seize back their capital from12,000 Russian troops, and that this humiliating defeat is fueling Russia'scurrent ferocity. The Post emphasizes Russia's decision to usescary-sounding "incendiary" bombs. But Russia hasn't explained how these differfrom ones employed previously, and the paper doesn't seem to know either.            The NYT explains that the FTC assented to the $81 billionMobil-Exxon merger, the largest in history, after the two giants agreed to thelargest divestiture the agency has ever seen. The companies will have to sellabout 2,400, or 15 percent, of its stations. Things don't look as rosy for theBP Amoco's proposed $29 billion purchase of Atlantic Richfield. Since bothdominate exploration in Alaska, federal and state officials are worried that amerger might deflate competition and raise prices in the area. The story notesthat all four companies were part of the Rockefeller oil empire that was brokenup by trustbusters in 1911. Competition for new oil reserves is much morerobust these days, which is why the companies are being allowed to rejoin.            The Post fronts a fascinating examination of one of the faith-basedsocial programs supported by George W. Bush the governor and now touted byGeorge W. Bush the candidate. A small prison in Texas is running a pilotproject called Inner Change that aims to convert inmates into bettercitizens--that is, better citizens who are fundamentalist Christians. Theprogram's founder, Charles Colson, found God while serving time for involvementin Watergate, and has since devoted his life to helping prisoners do the same.Bush claims that overtly religious programs work better than their more secularcounterparts because they use "the transforming power of faith." The program istoo young for a verdict on its effectiveness, but its participants are notablymore serene and cheerful than other convicts.             Recent polls have Gore and Bradley running neck-and-neck in some Northernstates. But an LAT front-pager puts the Bradley hype in perspective bydescribing his deep unpopularity in the South. Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes--a Goresupporter--calls Bradley a "Northeastern, elitist, old-time liberal." Even moreinsultingly, an Emory political scientist shuns him as a "Michael Dukakis orWalter Mondale." Even Bradley's jock credentials don't mean much in Dixie: "Thesport in the South that borders on being a religion is football," anotheranalyst points out. As the story admits, it's impossible to isolate the sourceof Bradley's unpopularity: does he really rub Southerners the wrong way, or arethey just intensely loyal to Gore?            Lachrymose stories in all three papers chronicle yesterday's 20-16 footballwin by Texas A&M over the University of Texas. The LAT andWP stories, on the front pages of their respective papers, are writtenin prose much purpler than the NYT account. All three papers note thatthe game drew the largest crowd for a football game in Texas history. None saysthe obvious--that it would have been heartless for UT not to let the Aggieswin.            Yesterday morning, says an LAT front-pager, a man was killed in ashootout with police officers after he lead them on a three-hour freeway carchase. Five news helicopters hovered overhead and broadcast the shooting live.The stations defended themselves by arguing that they could have showedclose-ups of the killing but refrained from doing so. "It is not our policy toshow graphic violence. We have to be cautious," said one producer.
