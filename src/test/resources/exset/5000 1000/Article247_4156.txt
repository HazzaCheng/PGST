                                 Siege of State            The LosAngeles Times leads with Boris Yeltsin's blunt reaction to PresidentClinton's criticism of Russia's Chechnya operation: Don't forget that Moscowhas a vast nuclear arsenal. The Wall Street Journal flags Yeltsin at the top of itsfront-page news box. The New York Timescarries Yeltsin's remarks inside (as do the other papers), somehow leadinginstead with the promise made Thursday by Russian officials that refugeeswho've flooded out of Chechnya recently will be able to return toRussian-controlled parts of the region by the end of the year. The paperexplains this is intended to signify that Russia is making progress towardsstabilizing the Chechen situation. The Washington Post goes with the Army's newest recruitmentlure: offering entry-level soldiers an array of virtually no-cost college-levelcourses over the Internet leading to an associate's degree. This unprecedentededucational expansion for G.I.s , the WP explains, is a sign of thedifficulties the Army is having trying to compete with the booming civilian jobmarket. USAToday leads with a new outside study blaming government and industryfor failing to sufficiently ensure the Y2K-compliance of the nation's drinkingwater and sewage systems.            The LAT calls Yeltsin's comments, which came while he was in China towin support for the Chechnya operation, an "outburst," and compares it toNikita Kruschev's "We will bury you." But the paper depicts both PresidentClinton and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as trying to de-escalate. Theother papers agree on these points with this slight difference: The NYTsee Yeltsin's performance as "apparently calculated."            The WP lead explains that the Army's new educational initiative isparticularly well suited to Hispanics, who make up 40 percent of thosepotential recruits who show high military aptitude despite lacking ahigh-school diploma, and to deployed soldiers, who, it is thought, should beable to keep up with course work via Internet-aided "distance learning" farbetter than they could via traditional classroom-based coursework. A questionthe story doesn't address: Why is this change only being proposed by the Army?Wouldn't it also help the other branches with their recruitment woes?                           USAT , the WP , and LAT front (while the NYTstuffs) the fascinating spy story unfolding in Washington, where the day beforeyesterday it was announced that a career Russian intelligence officer was sentpacking after being caught engaging in an eavesdropping operation against theState Department. The coverage reports that the Russian was, without everhaving set foot in the building, communicating with a bug that had beenprofessionally secreted in spaces near Madeleine Albright's offices--the firstever known penetration of Foggy Bottom. It is reported that some 50-100sensitive meetings took place there during the bug's deployment.            The NYT and WP report that the Russian operative was caught with a device hidden in his clothingthat turned on a receiver and tape recorder in his car. The LAT quotesone "senior official" who denies that there was a recorder involved, but alsoothers saying there was. The LAT says officials refuse to say whetherdisinformation was fed to the Russians after the bug was discovered, while theWP says this is precisely what was done.            The LAT points out that the former Soviet Union excelled in this sortof high-tech bugging, and gives a nice history of the known Soviet operationsof this sort undertaken against U.S. facilities. The story also quotes formerCIA director Robert Gates as saying that 15 years ago the U.S. was concernedabout the Soviets' "ability to read conversations from the vibrations of windowpanes in Washington." A question about that: Presumably the window panetechnology and U.S. worries about it are classified. So who says privatecitizen Gates can mouth off about it to the LAT ? Today's Papers guessesthat if this statement came out of the mouth of say, Daniel Ellsberg, handcuffsmight be involved.
