                                 Tax Chat and Tina Talk                        Issue 1 is tax cuts. Issue 2 is the presidential campaign. Issue 3 isHillary and Rudy.            There's very little consensus on what the tax debate holds. For example, onNBC's Meet the Press , Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., says itwould be best to just forget cutting taxes and go home. Then Senator PhilGramm, R-Texas, says he would just as soon wait on a tax cut until George W.becomes president. And on ABC's This Week , George Will says even a$700 billion cut is too small, while Bill Kristol says that the GOP reallyought to scuttle tax cuts, pay off the national debt, and hike militaryspending.            Most pundits agree that the fate of a tax cut this year will not be knownuntil after a summer recess. For now, both parties are digging in rather thancompromising. The pundits fall into two camps. Those who argue that Clintonwill compromise--i.e., sign a tax cut greater than the $300 billion ceiling henow demands--point to several signs, such as (a) Al Gore's release of a modesttax cut proposal this week, (b) Clinton's desire to make a deal with the GOP onentitlement reform, and (c) the eagerness of some Senate Democrats to be seenas tax-cutters before election time (Bob Novak, of CNN's Capitol Gang ;Susan Page and Tucker Carlson, of CNN's Late Edition ; and Paul Gigot,of PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ).            Pundits predicting a stalemate point out that (a) in an off-year Clintonwon't be as eager to compromise as he was on welfare in 1996, and (b) HouseDemocrats think a stalemate will work against the GOP during next year'scongressional elections ( Capitol Gang's Al Hunt; NewsHour'sMark Shields; Late Edition's Steve Roberts; and This               Week's George Stephanopoulos).            On the campaign front, pundits continue to express pity for the bumblingGore and awe at the seemingly invincible George W. Some programs replay a LamarAlexander ad now running in Iowa which indirectly attacks Bush for his runawayfund-raising. Most pundits--such as Kristol, Gigot, and Shields--think the adis ineffective because George W. raised all his money from under-$1,000contributions and seemingly without improper influence. The opinion mafiaagrees that the remaining mainstream candidates in the GOP race--Alexander,Quayle, and Dole--are in free-fall and must win big in next month's Iowa strawpoll.            On Meet the Press , Bill Bradley says that race will be the focus ofhis campaign. Later that morning, on Late Edition , Page and Robertsagree that the race issue is a non-starter, while Carlson says it will pullGore to the left, preventing him from having a "Sister Souljah moment." OnThe McLaughlin                Group , the panelists make fun of Gore andagree that his campaign is still faltering.            The pundits feast on Hillary Clinton's revealing interview in Tina Brown'sforthcoming magazine, Talk . Hillary says President Clinton's affairwith Monica Lewinsky stemmed from an "abusive" home environment and that hismistakes don't negate his other accomplishments. This Week even opensits show with a special roundtable just on Hillary. (To her credit, CokieRoberts does mention that ABC is owned by the same parent company asTalk .) Kristol, a Cheshire grin on his face, calls Hillary's remarks"the epitome of modern liberal psychobabble," a sentiment shared by Will. Mostpundits--including Stephanopoulos and Page--think it will hurt her Senatechances. Meanwhile, the commentariat is divided over Rudy Giuliani'stongue-in-cheek campaign trip to Arkansas (Page and McLaughlin's MortZuckerman approve, Hunt and McLaughlin's Huffington disapprove).                           John McLaughlin, Child of the '60sAfter inveighing against the raping and pillaging at Woodstock '99 (a videosegment of concert-goers is captioned "250,000 Attendees & Hopped-UpPsychos"), John McLaughlin finds himself waxing nostalgic for the hippies ofyesteryear: "At the first Woodstock there was [also] heavy rain, there were[also] people standing around [under a hot sun], there were long lines forfood, but they were respectable."                           Winners and LosersWhen Capitol                Gang's Bob Novak notes that even DemocraticSenator Bob Toricelli voted for the GOP's tax cut, Margaret Carlson callsToricelli a rich-coddling Democratic poseur--"the senator [of] Goldman Sachs.""His constituency is partly you, Bob," she says. Novak responds: "The winnersof society, I hope."                           The Last Word"It works out to about 5 cents per lie."--Arianna Huffington, on Judge Susan Webber Wright's $90,000 fine of BillClinton
