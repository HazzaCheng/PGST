                                 Pontifficating            All the majors lead with the last day of the White House's defense in theSenate and lavish most of their attention on the concluding speech given byformer Arkansas senator Dale Bumpers.            The consensus is that Bumpers' aw-shucks style and his rhetorical flourisheswere viewed by the Senate audience as a refreshing contrast to the lawyerlynit-picking (such as that displayed by Clinton private attorney David Kendall,who also spoke yesterday) that had heretofore carried the day. The New YorkTimes 's R.W. Apple assesses Bumpers' effort as "rare eloquence" and theLosAngeles Times calls it an "extraordinary appeal." The Washington Post plays high Bumpers' challenge to the Senatenot to vote for impeachment in order to avoid heightening people's alienationfrom their government. The NYT plays this much lower. The papers notethat Bumpers made no effort to defend President Clinton's conduct, calling it"indefensible, outrageous, unforgivable, shameless." The LAT goes highwith Bumpers' view that nonetheless, Clinton's actions "do not even come closeto being an impeachable offense" because they were not "political offensesagainst the state."            The NYT notes Bumpers' observation that Clinton should have thoughtabout the consequences of his actions beforehand. But the paper leaves out whathappened next, which is however reported by the WP : Bumpers pointed athis former colleagues, saying, "Just as you and you and you and you, andmillions of other people who have been caught in similar circumstances, shouldhave thought of it before." The Post is also alone in noting thatBumpers broke new ground for President Clinton's defenders by explicitly citingClinton's high poll numbers as a reason to acquit.            The coverage suggests that in the wake of Bumpers, momentum is buildingamong senators to press for a quick resolution of the trial, even to the pointof omitting all witnesses. USA Today emphasizes this more than the details ofBumpers' speech. And the LAT 's lead editorial calls for bringing thetrial to a rapid end. It's recognized all around that today the proceedingswill enter a far more spontaneous stage, with senators submitting theirquestions in writing to Chief Justice Rehnquist. The WP runs questionssubmitted by readers. It will be interesting to see if the actual questionsposed are equally sharp.            The off-lead at the two Times and the WP is yesterday's murderconviction in Mexico City of Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of a formerMexican president. Salinas was found guilty by the trial judge of being theauthor of the successful 1994 assassination of a fast-rising political star. Hewas sentenced to fifty years in prison. The outcome signals, says theNYT , that Mexico's elite no longer enjoys its traditional impunity.            The Wall Street Journal "Washington Wire" runs some pollfigures about the budget surplus: 45 percent prefer using it for SocialSecurity, 29 percent want it to go for domestic spending, and only 22 percentfavor tax cuts.            The LAT front carries an exclusive account of a particularly twistedcomputer crime. In the first prosecution ever under California's cyber-stalkingstatute, an L.A. man (who, natch, lived with his 80-year-old mother) is beingtried for using the Internet in an attempt to set up the rape of a woman whohad spurned him. The man sent out email and posted online ads purporting to befrom the woman suggesting she desired to act out fantasies of being raped. Thepostings resulted in six different men showing up at the woman's apartment atvarious times, although no rape occurred. The man was caught with theassistance of the Internet providers involved, which included AOL and Hotmail.It's hard to know what the woman could have done to protect herself, theLAT notes--after all, she didn't own a computer.            The NYT front reports that the Pope is returning to Mexico. But it'san inside piece at the WP that has the most surprising news about theupcoming visit--this time, he has corporate sponsors, including Pepsi, FederalExpress, Sheraton Hotels, Kodak, Hewlett-Packard and Mercedes-Benz. Churchofficials defend the practice, says the Post , as a way of avoidingcharging the poor to see the pontiff. Perhaps the wackiest papal productplacement is the Frito-Lay promotion that plays off the word "papa,"which--thank God--means both "pope" and "potato."
