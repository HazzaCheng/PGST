It's veryexciting." Who said this about what?                                  (Question courtesy ofJamie Smith and Andy Aaron.)                                                    Sendyour answer by noon ET Tuesday to newsquiz@slate.com .                           Thursday's Question(No. 325)--"Wrapped Attention":                                       In a TV commercial running in Houston, friends cover a Diane Keatonlook-alike in bubble wrap then roll her down a hill and through a sprinkler. Wedon't find out what's being advertised until the end, when the tag line comesup. For 500 points and the game: What is the tag line?                        "George W. Bush: The courage to laugh at women on death row. The creativity tocarry out the execution in bold new ways."-- Jake Tapper ( JenniferMiller had a similar answer.)            "Arrive moist and fresh. Fly Federal Express."-- Merrill Markoe                        "Everybody in Packing Materials. The Gap. (You forgot to mention she waslip-syncing "Helter Skelter.")-- Floyd Elliot (similarly, MichaelMannella and Al Estrada-Berg )            "Ayear later this footage was found. The Blair Witch Project II ."-- PaulKrug                        "We'readding new diagnostic procedures each day.

Randy's Wrap-Up                        Many News Quizparticipants suggest that the entire Bush campaign is an ad for which we do notknow the product. Sure, this is cowardly, intellectually dishonest, and aninsult to the democratic process, but it's also thrifty, and that's important,too. (Not important to G.W., who enjoys Scrooge McDuckian campaign funds, butimportant in ways that will be revealed at the end. Of something.) As long asG.W.'s policies remain ambiguous, every TV ad is a stealth Bush ad. Anycommercial that features some kind of cool car driving through some kind ofperfect landscape implicitly says: Let G.W. (the driver) take the nation (thecar) into the future (it's just over the next fashion model). Or the ad whenthe Wagnerian soprano (G.W.) spears (anti-missile system) the cell phone (badschools?) of a discourteous opera fan (affirmative action? The Taliban?): Ithink that means he wants to cut taxes for his rich friends. You can't beoverly literal. This thing works subconsciously, like workfare.                           Answer                        "Shop together, play together, eat together."            The ad is for the Mills Corp.'s 10 th andnewest mall, each organized around the theme "total experience," by which ismeant a combination of shopping and entertainment, by which is meant a chanceto buy stuff at Foot Locker and then play a video game. The malls combinediscount shopping, high-tech amusement arcades, theme restaurants, and 24-30screen multiplexes showing the same teen-sex comedies, but on 24-30screens.            The reason we don't knowwhy they're being so mean to Diane Keaton until the end of the ad? "That wasvery deliberate. The idea is to give a sense of intrigue that this is a newtype of experience," said John Parlota, executive vice president of the adagency that produced the spot. "Of course, when people find out it's justanother crappy mall, they get pretty damn mad, but by then, I'm miles away," hedid not add.
