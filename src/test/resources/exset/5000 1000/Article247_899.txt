                                 Tina Goes to Hollywood            The queen is dead.            Come Aug. 1, New Yorker editor Tina Brown will depart and make roomfor the magazine's fifth--but not yet announced--editor. The bomb was droppedat a hastily convened meeting at 10:30 this morning. Indeed, many of themagazine's staffers were still sipping their first cup of coffee when word wentout that Tina wanted to address "the staff." And so they gathered in what isknown as "the piazza," an open space adjacent to the corridor where themagazine's senior editors sit.            Sporting a simple blue suit, her hair streaked with just the right amount ofblond, Tina walked into the piazza and started speaking while stragglers werestill making their way up the stairs. This was, she said, a very difficultthing to do, but she had been presented with an opportunity that she simplycouldn't refuse. After uttering the usual platitudes about how The NewYorker is the best magazine in the business, Tina became farklemptas she pronounced, "I love you all." Then, of course, came the hugs--along withtears from the members of Tina's inner-circle who are surely wondering what allof this means for them.            And what does it mean for Tina's devotees? Culturebox can only speculate.Tina is certainly responsible for bringing in most of the magazine's hottestwriters, and here we're referring to people like the unrivaled David Remnickand Malcolm Gladwell, both of whom cut their teeth at the WashingtonPost . Some will probably follow Tina to her next stop, a new media ventureformed by Miramax that will publish a monthly magazine and books, as well asproduce films and television shows. (She will be the chairwoman and a partowner of the new company.)            But what will become of The New Yorker ? During Tina's tenure, themagazine's editors were always talking about "the mix"--the never-endingstruggle to strike the right balance between the slashy and the serious. Thecharge that Tina was too fond of the former is by now a cliche. It is alsoprobably the last thing on the mind of billionaire Si Newhouse, who suddenlyseems concerned with turning a profit at the magazine. And who can blame him?After all, as Fortune put it recently, the president and CEO of CondeNast, Steven Florio, "turned a mildly profitable property into one of thegreatest money pits in American magazine history." Under the Florio brothers,Steve and Tom, The New Yorker has lost a whopping $175 million. It's nosurprise, then, that Newhouse has decided to merge the magazine into his CondeNast empire. Next year, the The New Yorker 's sinecured staffers willmove into Conde Nast's new headquarters and will fight for phone lines and deskspace with the rest of Si's magazines.            As for who will preside over this dark day in New Yorker history, wecan only report what we have gleaned from the rumor mill over on 43rd Street.The most obvious candidate seems to be Graydon Carter, the celebrity (if notcelebrated) editor of Vanity Fair who has perfected the formula for theprofile that simultaneously glamorizes and eviscerates its subject. It seemsless likely that Newhouse will go with an inside The New Yorkercandidate, though if he does, the best choice might be James Stewart, arespected newspaperman who did a tour as Page One editor of the Wall StreetJournal in the early 1990s. Dark horses inside the magazine include Remnickand Kurt Andersen. To this mix, Culturebox would like to add a candidate of itsown: Chip McGrath, the editor of the New York Times Book Review . Aformer staff member at The New Yorker , McGrath was passed over whenRobert Gottlieb acceded to power, but over the past few years he has done abang-up job at the Book Review , giving it all of the heft of the NewYork Review of Books with none of the intellectual snobbery. All the while,he has been writing nifty pop culture pieces for the New York Times               Magazine , so he seems to have that ingredient of "the mix" covered aswell.            Place your bets.            -- Jonathan Mahler
