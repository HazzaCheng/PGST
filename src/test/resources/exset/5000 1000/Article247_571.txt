                                 Missilany            The New YorkTimes 's top national story is that despite three years of contraryassurances to the U.S., Russia is helping India build a nuclear missile. TheWashington Post 's top national story is an accountof how, fifteen years and $50 billion after Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" speech,the U.S. still doesn't have an anti-ballistic-missile defense system. TheLosAngeles Times goes with the Clinton administration's decision to opposethe California ballot referendum measure calling for an end to publicly fundedbilingual education, a measure thought to be favored by 70 percent of thestate's voters. USA Today leads with Defense Secretary William Cohen'swarning to Congress that failure to approve an emergency spending bill and anew round of base closings will mean big layoffs of Pentagon civilians andfewer high-tech weapons.            According to the Times , in 1995 Russian officials told the U.S. thatits help on the Indian missile project was limited, and didn'tinvolve the missile design. In return, the Clinton administration cleared theway for American/Russian cooperation in space. However, U.S. intelligencereports have continued to suggest a bigger Russian role. The Timespoints out that Russia's technical assistance raises fears of a stepped-up armsrace between India and Pakistan, against whom India has fought three wars, andwhich has just tested a nuclear-capable missile of its own.            The WP reports that out of twenty intercept tests in the past decade,only seven anti-missile missiles struck their targets. Since thelast success in 1994, there have been six straight failures. While the Clintonadministration has not committed to deploying a national anti-missile shield,under pressure from the GOP (national missile defense was a tenet of the"Contract With America"), it has promised to accelerate testing. But, the paperreports, only one actual flight trial of the entire system is planned beforethe administration must decide whether or not to place it in operation.            According to a big USAT investigative piece, two years after theValuJet crash, airline passengers are still being endangered by improperlylabeled or packaged hazardous materials on their flights. For the story,USAT shipped unmarked boxes with six different courier services andthree of them did not do what FAA rules require: ask for a photo ID and adeclaration that the boxes were free of hazardous goods. Although the FAA seemsto be catching more violators, the paper quotes one of the agency's topofficials saying, "We wouldn't know whether hazardous materials are inside if apackage doesn't leak or break open."            The Wall Street Journal 's main "Politics and Policy" piece saysthat Asia views as smart the U.S. economic strategy of getting the IMF to comein with rescue packages that don't directly cost the U.S. that much. And henceif Congress defeats the Clinton administration's proposal to pony up $18billion for the IMF, the Asian economic players will be at least confused andpossibly hostile.            The NYT reports the latest sign of the Mafia's decline: according to federalexperts, the "Commission," the mob's equivalent to the U.N. Security Council,where deals between New York's five "families" were made and disputes ironedout, hasn't met in almost two years. Why? Convictions and indictments of topmobsters have created chronic uncertainty about who can speak for the variousfamilies as well as increased concerns about exposure at meetings to informersand undercover police officers.            Sunday's NYT front had a home run piece by Jill Abramson detailingthe current investigation fad in Washington, along the way coining a goodphrase for it. There are currently, Abramson reported, 31 separate officialinquiries into reported wrongdoing by Bill Clinton, members of hisadministration or figures in the Democratic Party. Not to mention all thelawyers, PIs and journalists this entails. "Washington has become," she writes,"the center of a scandal-industrial complex." The piece also carried this quotefrom Clinton staffer James E. Kennedy in response to congressional complaintsabout the number of White House lawyers working to defend Clinton: "It's likean arsonist complaining about the size of the fire department." Kennedy, by theway, is termed "the White House scandal spokesman."            Never let it be said that the WP doesn't kick you when you're down.In its "Style" section debrief of Saturday night's star-studded White HouseCorrespondents' Dinner, the paper says that "Dick Cavett was there, trying toremember which year he was the dinner's featured entertainer."
