                                 Twilight of the Tax-Cutters                        No one has told the Wall Street Journal editorial writers, to besure, but pushing for tax cuts has become the political equivalent of floggingthat proverbial dead horse. Congressional Republicans watched their proposed$793 billion tax cut disappear from sight without much of a fight. Steve Forbesis the only presidential candidate still banging the flat-tax drum, and even hehas reinvented himself as a social conservative. Earlier this summer, AlanGreenspan notoriously--at least for those on the right--said he'd rather see abudget surplus go toward paying down the debt than toward a major tax cut. Andmost polls show that the American public ranks lower taxes low on the totempole of priorities for the government.            It's true that if you frame poll questions about taxes differently, you getdifferent responses. Greenspan did say he would prefer a tax cut to moregovernment spending, and it's safe to assume that the Republican Party platformin 2000 will call for a significant tax cut. But that call sounds increasinglyhollow, at least from an intellectual perspective, and the reason is not justthat bringing the budget into balance (via, in no small part, the 1993 taxincrease) has proved to have pleasant side effects for the economy. Even moreimportant is the fact that much of the Reaganite case for tax cutting dependedon the harsh reality of life in an inflationary economy.            Supply-siders have now become among the most ardent advocates of the ideathat inflation is dead, and that therefore the economy can safely grow muchfaster than it has in the past. But they don't appear to have considered whatthe death of inflation might mean for their tax-cutting fervor.            In Wealth and Poverty , for instance, George Gilder made the impact ofinflation central to his emphasis on tax-cutting. Effectively calling for anend to the capital-gains tax, he wrote, "With a rate of inflation over 8percent, a 20 percent tax on capital gains quickly rises above 100 percent inits average impact on assets held more than a few years." Contrasting thesituation of the late 1970s with that of the early 1960s, when top marginalrates on income and capital gains ranged as high as 91 percent, he noted that"the real tax rate is far higher, not lower, than it was during the days ofKennedy's Camelot. ... The real tax was not 70 percent, but 70 percent of anominal amount of earnings that was mostly inflation, combined with a declinein the value of principal equal to the rate of inflation."            What Gilder was pointing to here was in fact important. Because tax bracketsand capital gains are not indexed, the combination of rapid inflation and hightaxes ends up eating away most real gains. It works something like compoundinterest in reverse. In the 1970s, just staying ahead of the game took a lot ofeffort.            The really important blow against this state of affairs was not the Reagantax cuts but rather Paul Volcker's interest-rate hikes, which endeddouble-digit inflation. And in any case, the reduction of the capital-gains taxon long-term investments to 20 percent had already happened (in 1978) by thetime Wealth and Poverty was published. Regardless, though, there wassomething to the idea that in a time of high inflation, high marginal tax ratesacted as a disincentive to both investment and labor.            But we don't live in a time of high inflation anymore. Actually, we don'tseem to live in a time of inflation at all. And with a rate of inflation of 2percent or so, a capital-gains tax of 20 percent has an average impact onassets of about, well, 20 percent. And if you look at the trading volume onU.S. stock exchanges, it's pretty clear that the 39.8 percent rate onshort-term gains isn't keeping too many people from investing. As for bracketcreep, I'm not sure anyone even remembers what that is. Which doesn't mean thatwe need to go back to 1979. But it does mean that, from an economic perspectiveat least, ardent tax-cutters need to come up with a new idea. Perhaps theycould call it the Post-Inflation Paradigm.
