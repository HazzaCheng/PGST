                                  Me on Me on Garrison Keillor                                             (Note: Garrison Keillor's new book, Me by Jimmy (Big Boy)Valente as Told to Garrison Keillor , was published Monday. The publisherdescribes it as "an uproarious political satire about a professional wrestlerwho's elected governor.")                                                      What have you gotagainst Garrison Keillor?                        Me:Nothing.                           Come on, you're talkingto me.                        Me:Nothing, really. Just one time (this was years before I was a second-tierpublic radio personality) I went to see his show at the Tech College, caughthim out in the corridor, and lied to him about how much I liked his show(really, he talks so slow it makes me nervous, plus all that lip noiseindicating introspection being released into the atmosphere) and, silly boy,launched into how I was doing a live daily radio show from a greasy spoon andall, and he looked at me and said, "Do you know where the bathroom is?" I did,having just been there. But I vowed on the spot that, should I ever be in aposition to be accosted by fans, or faux fans, in a hallway, wanting to tell meabout their life, I would always have something more constructive to say.                           Unless you really haveto pee.                        Me:True. But I try to emulate country music stars--they may be assholes, butthey're great to their public.                           Working on the assholepart?                        Me: Youshould talk.                           Right. So what besidesthat?                        Me:Nothing. Well, in every press interview I've ever had that goes over 25 words,two of them are "Garrison" and "Keillor." That gets to you pretty quick. Theyall want to talk about what we have in common, as if I'm doing Lutheranstandup. I told one guy from Night Scene in Biloxi, Miss., that I was upto .67 Keillor Units, but that was just bravado and doesn't include royalties,speaking fees, catalog sales, ancillary rights, etc. Now this well-timed newbook should put him way ahead. You could probably get two or three of me forone Garrison now.                           And a player to benamed later. So it's the shadow thing?                        Me:Yeah. Either he's getting bigger or the sun is setting.                           On the other hand, he'sgot Mark Twain between him and daylight.                        Me:That would account for the occasional white suit.                           And he's got to getpast Ring Lardner first.                        Me:True. And Benchley. And S.J. Perelman ...                           ... can rest inpeace.                        Me: Yousaid it .                           Who wins a Jesse "TheBody" vs. Gary "The Kitty Boutique" grudge match?                        Me: Mymoney's on Garrison, as long as it stays out of the parking lot.                           Yeah, in a parking lothe's dead, bent over the trunk of a Trans Am, face smeared against the rearwindow.                        Me:Brains all over the Oakley Thermonuclear Protection decal.                           Yeah. For messing withthe best.                        Me:Hooyah! But if it's strictly hyperbole, with the ring strung with verbal barbedwire, Garrison will helicopter him on one finger so Jesse pees outside thering.                           Read the new book,huh?                        Me: Worse, I took it onvacation. Fortunately, I had Nabokov's short stories. White Russians drinkingthe same. Anyway, Me is kind of a comic book, very heavy on graphicslike you used to find in Johnson and Smith catalogs, and rife with bold printemphasizing nothing in particular:                           Fairbanks White Blaze Vanderbilt Used Rambler Alcan Highway The postoffice The cogs simply do not mesh As a bear would say goodbye to a legtrap                                       That's not bad. I kindof like that.                        Me:Sounds like Red Green on acid.                           So you pretty muchliked the book then?                        Me: No.It's pretty hard to parody a parody.                           But it's "a politicalsatire."                        Me:Animal Farm was a political satire. "A Modest Proposal," was a politicalsatire. What Garrison has written is a parody. Look it up. And why do we callhim by his first name, anyway? What is he, "Saddam"?                           Anything else you likedabout the book?                        Me: The guy looking at thePlayboy spread "The Women of NPR." Now that's funny.
