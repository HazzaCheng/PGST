                                 "Don't Ask" Don't Work            The New York Times leads with PresidentClinton's announcement (or admission) that the administration's "don't ask,don't tell" policy regarding homosexuals in the military isn't working. Ratherthan implement a new policy, Clinton is expected to push military officials tobetter enforce the current one. The statement was prompted by his wife'sremarks earlier this week that gays and lesbians should be allowed to serveopenly. The Los Angeles Times reefers Clinton's remarks and leads withan expose on failings of the state's education system. California's director ofspecial education maintains that as many as 250,000 children have beenincorrectly assessed as "learning disabled" and funneled into California'sspecial education programs simply because they were not taught to read. TheWashington Post leads with the State Department'swarning that Americans abroad should take extra security precautions in thenext month; the department has "credible information" that terrorist groups areplanning attacks that target American citizens. The LAT, whose sourcesare quoted by the Post , reefers the announcement.            Despite the WP headline, Americans abroad needn't run for the hillsjust yet. Such announcements are relatively common, although they usuallyaccompany military actions, economic sanctions, or other foreign policyinitiatives (yesterday's warning was the fifth since October). ThePost suggests that the warnings are a reference to Osama Bin Laden'sterrorist organization, but the link is dubious: Officials wouldn't name agroup, they only "indicated that [Bin Laden's group] is the most importantorganization seeking to undermine U.S. interests." The Post alsopoints out that that attacks could occur any time from now through New Year,until the first week in January, when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends.Does the State Department's announcement mention Ramadan, or did theWP add it? Either way, someone seems to be equating Islam andterrorism without explaining why. And wouldn't a Muslim terrorist be lesslikely, not more likely, to take terrorist action during a holy month?            The WP and the LAT front stories highlighting differentfacets of the AIDS epidemic. The Post examines Africa, where thedisease kills 5,000 people each day and could kill as many as 13,000 per day in2005. The article stresses the economic ramifications of these statistics: InKenya and Zimbabwe, projected GDP in 2005 may be as much as 20 percent lowerthan it would have been without the disease's effect on young workers. TheLAT article on AIDS in the U.S. emphasizes a more encouragingtrend--hospices once filled with patients dying from AIDS are emptying andclosing because their patients are getting better and leaving, a phenomenondubbed "the Lazarus syndrome."            The LAT points to today's too-close-to-call presidential race inChile as a sign that the country's democratization has progressed sincedictator Augusto Pinochet stepped down over 10 years ago. The contest, whichincludes candidates from Chile's main right and left parties as well as fourindependent candidates, is expected to end in a run-off, the first in thecountry's history.            A NYT special report examines Clinton fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe.McAuliffe is seen as a new breed of entrepreneurial fund-raisers who leveragetheir services not to obtain cushy ambassadorial posts or lobbyist clout but tohelp fuel telecommunications, banking, and real-estate  business deals. They'vealso helped fuel some lawsuits: "I've signed thousands of documents, but neverread them," McAuliffe remarks. Unlike Vernon Jordan, who plans to relocate to aNew York City investment bank when his friend Bill steps down, McAuliffe plansto stay active in politics and is already raising money for Hillary Clinton'sSenate bid.                           Now That's Synergy: Used to be that only moviestudios could use high-profile glossy magazines to flog their product. Now, theNYT reports, tobacco companies are paying publishers like Time Inc.millions of dollars to generate magazines similar in look and feel to populartwentysomething mags like Maxim and Mademoiselle. The newmagazines, packed with tobacco ads, are an attempt to plug the "communicationgap" (as an R.J. Reynolds memo puts it) created by independent magazines, whichgenerally limit tobacco ads to only 2 percent or 3 percent of total ads. Butpersistent rumors that Joe Camel has signed on to star opposite Gwyneth Paltrowin an upcoming Miramax police drama are just that.
