A FewMore Minutes of Depression                        Regarding Michael Kinsley's"Readme" aboutthe Internet and its links to depression: Maybe people who use the Internet alot get depressed because the Internet is just more interesting than theirregular lives. They meet people who share their preoccupations, quirks, senseof humor, and sexual fantasies, people who like to argue about politics andreligion (still taboo subjects in much of real-life America), who are expertsin fascinating subjects, and who like to explain them. They can take on apseudonym and express parts of themselves that they have to repress in theirordinary lives. They can play bridge and chess and mental footsie with peoplein Russia and Japan. Then they come back to real life, and the contrast makesthem feel bad. Same old, same old.            Don'tforget--the subjects of the Internet depression study lived in Pittsburgh. Theymay already have been anxious, bored, dissatisfied with their lives. But theythought that was just the way life was, so when social scientists asked if theywere happy, they said, "Sure." After a year on the Net, they know it doesn'thave to be that way--but they're still living in Pittsburgh.                           --Katha Pollitt NewYork City                           The IRSHas Been Berry, Berry Good to Me                        In theSept. 9 "Today's Papers," Scott Shuger had this little tidbit:            The one problem with allthis: Despite the apparent oddity of the home run ball case, not one of thesehorrified public servants has shown why it isn't a perfectly straightforwardapplication of the gift tax. So shouldn't they rethink the whole idea?            Actually, I think itis a straightforward application of the tax code not to tax the gift ofthe ball, since there is no income to the person giving the ball away. Sincethe person who caught the ball gave nothing to receive the ball and receivednothing in return, even if the ball has some inherent value of $1,000,000,there is no "realizing event" that would trigger taxation. People are onlytaxed on income that is actually received, otherwise you would pay income taxon the increased value of your home every year (you only pay when yousell).            A rough analogy: Suppose MarkMcGwire threw a blank check for $1,000,000 into the crowd. If I caught it,returned it, and received nothing in return, I have nothing to tax. If I fillin my name and cash it, I pay tax. If I fill in the name of my best friend andhe cashes it, he pays income tax, and the person who signed the check (not me,since I am simply the conduit and never received any benefit) pays gifttax.            In short,this should not lead us to revisit the idea of a gift tax. The "IRS spokesman"quoted by the AP story simply misstated the law. There is no reason to changethe law, Shuger's evident wish to do so aside.            -- MichaelCarr Washington                           PluggingLeaks                        I enjoy                  Slate               's humor, but I just finished reading the "leaked" Starrreport ("StarrLush," by Art Levine) and found it amazingly stupid and insulting. Yes, theLewinsky affair deserves ridicule in many ways, but I can get lurid guessesabout the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship anywhere. From                   Slate                Iexpect and am paying for serious attempts to assess what happened and what theconsequences might be. Leave the idiotic romance novel accounts to others.            -- GregWeeks Carrboro, N.C.
