                                 Look for the Union Doctor            Lastweek, when the Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against the mergerof two HMO giants, the American Medical Association applauded the suit and tookcredit for urging the government to file it. Insurers were "intent on capturingthe medical marketplace," seeking "too much power to dictate the health careoptions offered patients," said AMA Chairman Randolph Smoak.            Twodays later, the AMA voted to set up a doctors' union and to lobby Congress foran antitrust exemption allowing all physicians to bargain collectively. Cynicssuggested that doctors were abandoning the Hippocratic oath for hypocriticalpolitics. To deflect this criticism, the AMA associated itself with favorableimages of organized labor while dissociating itself from unfavorable ones.                           1. We're on your side. Chip Kahn, president of the HealthInsurance Association of America (HIAA), which lobbies for HMOs, accuseddoctors of seeking bargaining power to raise their incomes "at the expense ofAmerican consumers and taxpayers." To thwart this charge, the AMA portrayedHMOs as the true enemy of consumers, implying that doctors were taking on theHMOs in defense of consumers. AMA President Nancy Dickey said doctors would"battle insurance companies and managed care plans that put healthy profitsahead of healthy patients." "Patient care is not at the top of health plans'list of priorities," Smoak asserted. "Our objective here is to give America'sphysicians the leverage they now lack to guarantee that patient care is notcompromised or neglected for the sake of profits."                           2. We're the little guy. HIAA officials depicted doctors as acartel, accusing them of pursuing "collusion" and "price fixing." At a Househearing last week, Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission officialsargued that exempting doctors from antitrust laws would stifle "competition,"limit "consumer choice," raise costs, and reduce "quality." The AMA ducked thiscritique by casting itself not as a business group but as an underdog allianceof working folks. Doctors are waging a "David versus Goliath" battle againstthe "abusive and unfair practices of insurance company giants" in a valianteffort "to level the playing field between patients and insurers," said Smoak.HMOs treat doctors like "ditch diggers churning through patients," addedDickey.                           3. We're not greedy. Unions have a reputation for shuttingdown important services and ignoring public inconvenience for the sake ofgreed. The AMA wants to avoid this reputation. "I don't really believe [theAMA's unionization] is being done for patients," one academic health careanalyst told the New York Times . "This is happening because doctors'incomes, doctors' sense of autonomy, are getting killed."            Tosidestep this complaint, AMA officials promised never to strike (though Dickeyconceded doctors might resist bad employers by "being a little slow incompleting some of the paperwork" required by HMOs) and avoided the word"union," instead calling their proposed alliance "an affiliated labororganization." The AMA's disclaimers underscored the liabilities of the "union"label. "This will not be a traditional labor union. Your doctors will notstrike or endanger patient care," Smoak assured the public.            Thebasic political equation in medicine is that patients expect better care thanthey're willing to pay for. When they're deprived of options and benefits thatexceed what they've paid for, or when they're obliged to pay premiumssufficient to cover the options and benefits they expect, they figure somespecial interest is ripping them off. The AMA's goal this week was to increaseits bargaining power without appearing to be that special interest.            And what is the media'sverdict? Unionization shows "how aggrieved many doctors feel," says theWashington Post . It changes the image of physicians who have "sometimesarrogantly presented themselves as part of an elite profession as opposed tomembers of a workers' group," says the New York Times , and it "may turnout to be a strong force against health plans that unfairly use their marketpower to limit quality of care." Whether the doctors' latest prescription willcure their ills remains to be seen. But they look great.
