                                 Conoco Games            With the Di saga receding ever so slightly, news diversity makes a smallcomeback. So we have USA Today leading with the failure of an airline rate hikeattempt, while the New York Timesgoes with Clinton vs. Gingrich on national educational testing, the Washington Post with a startling development in the PaulaJones lawsuit, and the Los Angeles Times leads with a local politicalstory.            With airlines flying at 77 percent capacity in August and the Dow JonesTransportation Index at record levels, it seemed like a good time for a 5percent fare increase, which, says USAT , most of the major domesticairlines put into place last week. But by last night, only two airlines stillhad it in all markets. USAT says that a computer system glitchmistakenly rolled back United Airline's increase in all markets and whenAmerican, Delta, and TWA saw that, they, fearing the loss of business frombeing underpriced, rolled their fares back too.            The NYT reports that President Clinton has decided to make nationaleducational standards testing a centerpiece of his second-term agenda. Clintonsays his call for fourth grade reading tests and eighth grade math tests shouldbe beyond partisanship. Yet, says the Times , Newt Gingrich and manyother Republicans in the House and Senate see it as a federal intrusion intothe schools. "The president is focused on the wrong end," Gingrich is quoted assaying. "He's focused on Washington bureaucracy, Washington regulations,Washington red tape." To avoid this sort of opposition, Clinton has emphasizedthat the tests would be voluntary and ultimately under the control of localschool authorities. He has also said the tests could be designed by abipartisan board. Some critics have said the problem is that the tests divertmoney away from actual educational improvements. They are estimated to cost $22million to develop. (To me, that's the only part that's hard to swallow. Whyshould an elementary school test cost millions?)            The Post reports that the two attorneys who have handled PaulaJones's lawsuit against the president thus far--including one successful tripto the Supreme Court--backed out of the case yesterday. Close sources say thatthe problem is that Jones rejected a $700,000 settlement offer because itdidn't include a full apology from the president. The paper cites as a factorin Jones's intransigence the influence of her new friend and public relationsconsultant, Susan Carpenter-McMillan. The piece also points out a strong reasonthe lawyers had for urging Jones to take the deal--they had recently switchedto a percentage contingency fee arrangement with her. (Does Jones's demurralshow that she's about more than money or does it show that she's about moremoney?)            The range of Di-related front-page stories indicates a level of interestthat just won't wait for real news. USAT has a story about how the royalfamily offered to restore the title of Her Royal Highness posthumously (and wasturned down by the Spencer family). The WP runs "Press PledgesRestraint" regarding Princes William and Harry, and "Diana Helped Choose Ring."The NYT front is graced by "Millions of Dollars Pouring in to Diana'sFavorite Charities."                           Correction : This column made a mistake last night in saying that AOLwas taking control of Prodigy. The column meant, of course, Compuserve. Thecolumn is sorry.            The Wall Street Journal "Work Week" column reports, "In asurvey of 1,000 adults, 46% said they would move next door to their in-laws fora 50% pay raise."            Both the NYT and LAT run front-page pieces reporting that onMonday, the Clinton administration decided to allow Conoco to conduct oildrilling on a federal property in Utah where last year, during the election,Clinton established a national monument to protect the wilderness fromdevelopment. This will be the first time that oil and gas drilling will beallowed at any national monument. Note to Fred Thompson: You might want to seeif Conoco was a soft money contributor to the Democrats in 1996. Just athought.
