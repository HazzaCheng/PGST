The toppling of old kingKohl, the longest-serving leader in any democracy, was received with greatexcitement across Europe, though less so in Germany than anywhere else.Everyone agreed that Helmut Kohl's departure marks "the end of an era," andthis was even the headline on a front-page editorial Monday in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Thepaper noted that this was the last German election in which Bonn, not Berlin,was the focus of attention. It also noted that foreign governments would havepreferred that Kohl win, because they fear that, with the move of its capitalfrom the Rhine to the Spree, Germany will become "more German and lessEuropean." "Kohl would have been the best man to dispel these concerns," itsaid. "Now Schrder and Lafontaine [the victorious Social Democrat leaders]have to prove that they are Europeans too, West Europeans." The FrankfurterAllgemeine also pointed out that "never before has an election been foughtin such an American style, with so much theatricality."            TheSddeutche Zeitungof Munich said it hopes this will be the last German election in which millionsof residents aren't allowed to vote because of their immigrant status:"Democracy doesn't function when certain people are excluded." Die Welt challenged the comparisonsbeing made between the next chancellor, Gerhard Schrder, and Bill Clinton andTony Blair. "Blair reformed his party; Schrder didn't," it said. "Schrder hasa Leftist, Lafontaine, behind him; Clinton doesn't." Nor was Schrder precededin office by a Reagan or a Thatcher who imposed strict economic discipline."Schrder has to do the unpopular things himself," Die Welt said.            In other West European countries, most of the editorialcomment concentrated on Kohl's place in history. The conservative Le Figaro of Paris said Schrderhas overthrown "a historic monument," a man who, following Thomas Mann'sformula, worked "so that Germany would become European in order to avoid Europebecoming German." In Italy, La Repubblica said that Schrder will automatically assume theleadership of the social democratic governments in Europe (which include thoseof France, Britain, and Italy) because of Germany's "dominant weight." "With awobbly America, a prostrate capitalist Asia, and two thirds of mankind facingthe risk of retreat into poverty, there has never been so much need of aEuropean model as today," it said.            InBritain, Kohl was praised as a figure of major historical importance, but hisdeparture was welcomed by papers opposing greater integration of Britain intoEurope. The tabloid Daily Mail said that "high on Herr Schrder's listis likely to be a forging of a closer alliance with Britain, not as asubstitute for French influence but at least as a counterweight to it." TheFinancial Times said: "Thetwo leitmotivs of Mr. Kohl's 16 years in office were European integration andGerman unification. It was his commitment to the former which ensured thatGermany achieved the latter, without arousing the suspicion and hostility ofits former wartime adversaries." In Spain, El Pas said the important thing is that Germany emergefrom the economic paralysis of the past few years, "because we all know thatwhat happens to Germany happens to some extent to all of Europe." El Mundo called Kohl agreat statesman to whom Spain is grateful for his support of its entry into theEuropean Union.            President Clinton has now receded from thefront pages across most of the world, though the Press of Christchurch, NewZealand, carried an editorial Monday advocating his removal. "What now can be said infavour of Bill Clinton?" it began. "Not much." And it concluded, "[T]hePresident has no one to blame for his fate but himself. He has tarnished hisoffice. His actions have earned him at best ridicule and at worst ignominy.Whenever he departs, he will leave a sad legacy."            La Stampa of Turin asked WoodyAllen for his views on the White House scandal. It is "a rather sad spectacle"from which nobody will emerge victorious, he replied. Asked if he feltsympathetic toward the president, he said, "I feel a great sense of solidaritywith everyone who finds himself under the scrutiny of the media, which in thiscase have behaved really badly."
