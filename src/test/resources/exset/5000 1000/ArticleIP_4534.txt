                                 The Microsoft Trial            The Microsoft antitrusttrial opened this week, and it wasn't hard to figure out the theme of theJustice Department's case. "On Day 1, U.S. Targets Gates," declared theWashington Post 's front-page headline: "Government Portrays MicrosoftChairman as Cagey, Ruthless." The New York Times called the DOJ'sopening statement "a pointed personal attack on the credibility and integrity"of Gates. David Boies, the DOJ's lead attorney, focused his statement on Gates,juxtaposing video clips of Gates' deposition, in which the Microsoft CEOasserted his innocence, with e-mail messages and memos that allegedlycontradicted those assertions.            Formonths, Microsoft has treated the antitrust case as a silly nuisance. Ratherthan attack the case the way it has purportedly attacked its competitors, thecompany has largely ignored it, instead using its rebuttal opportunities toproclaim itself a producer of wonderful products and a dogged servant ofconsumers. In his opening statement Tuesday, Microsoft lead attorney JohnWarden associated the company with "the march of progress driven by science andtechnology."            This narcissistic nice-guy act can't go on. In politics,when you're attacked, you attack back. The Clinton White House has demonstratedthe ugly efficacy of this strategy throughout the Monica Lewinskyinvestigation. The first weekend after the scandal broke, Clinton strategistJames Carville went on Meet the Press to declare "war" on IndependentCounsel Kenneth Starr. "The real focus here is on the methods [and] motives ofthe independent counsel," said Carville. He accused Starr of "wiring" women inhotel bars and plying them with whiskey. Two days later, Hillary Clinton calledStarr "a politically motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wingopponents of my husband." This line of attack, pursued relentlessly over thefollowing months, destroyed Starr's credibility. By the time Starr sent hisreport to Congress, polls indicated half the public placed no faith in hisfindings.            IfMicrosoft was to adopt the Clinton strategy, who would be its logical target?Let's see. Whom does the DOJ portray as Microsoft's chief victim? Netscape.Whose 1995 meeting with Microsoft is the centerpiece of the DOJ's case?Netscape's. Whose notes from that meeting are the DOJ's key evidence? Netscapeexecutive Marc Andreessen's. Who is the government's opening witness? NetscapeCEO Jim Barksdale. Which company's browser did the DOJ ask Microsoft to offerto Windows 98 customers? Netscape's. And who has most aggressively lobbied theDOJ and Congress to prosecute Microsoft? Netscape.            In its Oct. 19 response to Barksdale's writtentestimony, Microsoft signaled an increasing willingness to go on the attack."Mr. Barksdale's inflammatory comments about the [1995] meeting [are]misleading and self-serving comments from a company that is trying to attackMicrosoft through government interference, rather than by competing in themarketplace," charged Microsoft. "Mr. Barksdale apparently believes thatgovernment lawyers know better than millions of consumers, when it comes towhich browser is the best. ... Mr. Barksdale appears to believe that thegovernment should protect Netscape from the rigors of free market competition."On Oct. 20, Microsoft's media relations Web page steered reporters to aTimes op-ed that called Netscape "a master of predatory pricing."            Why Microsoft has previouslyeschewed this approach is anyone's guess. (                  Slate                has no insideinformation on this question.) Maybe the company feared it would sully itsimage by openly slinging mud at a competitor. Maybe it wanted to depriveNetscape of all publicity, including bad publicity. Maybe it thought theantitrust case was legal rather than political and that judges were the onlyaudience that matters. The best bets are: 1) Microsoft thought itself soobviously virtuous that it didn't need to defend its conduct. 2) SinceMicrosoft understands business far better than politics, it treated theantitrust fight as though it were just another marketing campaign.            Well, itisn't. For all its fearsomeness as an economic competitor, Microsoft has yet toappreciate that the weapons it is now facing--embarrassing memos and videoclips--are the weapons of politics, not of business.
