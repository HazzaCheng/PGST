                                 Aftershocks            Asocio-political aftershock rumbles through Turkey. The Aug. 17 earthquake "senttremors rippling through Turkey's political and social world, triggering abacklash against the traditional Turkish faith in an all-powerful state,"reported Toronto's Globe and Mail . Although it is unlikely that the currentgovernment will be brought down by the crisis, the paper says it could lead to"the grassroots development of Turkey's fragile democracy. The thousands ofvolunteers who poured into the earthquake zone will not easily forget the powerthey were able to mobilize."            Writing in the InternationalHerald Tribune , Turkish journalist Mehmet Ali Birand calledfor "massive economic-political support, reminiscent of the Marshall Plan."Referring to Turkey's longstanding application for membership in the EuropeanUnion, Birand said, "A special fund needs to be established to get the Turkisheconomy up and running, not under the leadership of the United States but thistime with a campaign led by the EU. It is urgent that the European Unionformally grant Turkey candidate status."            Meanwhile, Britain's Independent reported that the PKK Kurdish separatist group has started towithdraw its forces from Turkey into northern Iraq a week earlier thanpreviously announced. A statement issued by the group declared, "Tounilaterally stop the war at this time of heavy disaster is the greatestsupport to the state and people of Turkey," since money spent fighting the PKKshould instead go to earthquake-recovery efforts.            After25 years of comparative neglect, East Timor has found its way into the world'spapers this week (see Monday's ). Writing in the Globe and Mail , MarcusGee said that of the two options in the Aug. 30 referendum--autonomy withinIndonesia or independence--the most likely outcome might not be the best."Becoming independent may end their oppression; it will not end their troubles.In fact, it may only make those troubles worse." He added, "The independentnation of East Timor would be a flyspeck on the world map." Without Indonesiansubsidies East Timor would be at the mercy of the international aid communityand susceptible to civil strife.            Another referendum is scheduled to take place Sept. 16 in Algeria, where votersare being asked to approve or reject a presidential reconciliation effort thatoffers amnesty to people convicted of actively supporting violence as long asthey did not actually commit acts of violence. To enhance Algeria's chances ofpeace, Pakistan's Dawn said in an editorialthat the recent upsurge of political violence--at least 130 people have beenkilled by armed extremists in recent weeks--must "not be allowed to weaken orderail" the peace efforts. At the same time, the paper said, Algerian PresidentAbdelaziz Bouteflika "must concentrate his efforts on removing one of theprimary causes of popular discontent and strife, namely, economic mismanagementwhich has led to a high unemployment rate and declining living standards."            Thekidnapping of four Japanese mining engineers in the central Asian state ofKyrgyzstan has caused a crisis in Japan. According to AsahiShimbun , the hostage takers are Islamic rebels from Tajikistan.Mainichi Shimbun speculated that jealousy might have been amotive for groups within Tajikistan or other neighboring countries envious ofJapan's generous aid program to Kyrgyzstan. One commentator suggested that "theculprits may well have deliberately targeted the Japanese knowing that Japanplaces top priority on human lives in settling [hostage] cases. ... Takinghostages could be aimed at getting a ransom as well as weapons, water andfood." Another pundit questioned the Japanese aid agency's decision to declarethe area safe. Lax security has been blamed for other hostage-taking incidentsinvolving Japanese nationals, such as the four-month seizure of the JapaneseEmbassy in Lima, Peru, in 1996, and this may have led to a perception ofJapanese as easy targets, Asahi Shimbun said.
