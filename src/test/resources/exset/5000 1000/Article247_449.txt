                                 Affirmative Negation            The Supreme Court's decision Monday to let California's anti-affirmativeaction Proposition 209 stand leads at USA Today ,the Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes . The New York Timesleads with the emerging Republican congressional campaign against Clintonadministration small-scale health care reform--and sticks the 209 victory deepinside, on p.13 of the national edition.            The LAT says the 209 decision "marks a major victory for thechampions of a new colorblind standard for government." The three papersleading with 209 all make it clear that the decision will probably spur209-style laws in many states. And the LAT mentions that the HouseJudiciary Committee will consider a federal version later this week. The threealso point out that although this Court decision was probably the watershed,there might well be other eventual appeals based on cases where plaintiffsallege actual harm as a result of the law. The WP mentions anotherfactor that could lead to further legal challenge: 209 bans "preferentialtreatment" but does not define it. So look for cases that, for example, claimthat 209 doesn't prohibit preference-based recruiting for programs withcolor-blind internal standards.            The NYT health care lead states that the same business and insurancelobbyists who teamed up to help kill health care reform in 1994 are mobilizingto block the more modest, piecemeal federal quality-of-care proposals--likemandated-length hospital stays for certain procedures and government standardsfor health plans--that the Clinton administration has subsequently endorsed.The paper reports that Senate Republican leaders recently organizedanti-Clinton strategy briefings. The Times also notes an interestingsplit within the Republican constituency concerning this issue: Many doctors,convinced that managed care companies have cut into their autonomy and theirincomes, are in favor of many of the Clinton provisions reigning them in.            The Wall Street Journal runs a front-page feature about a groupof Allendale, South Carolina women with children who are striving to hold downthe jobs that have gotten them off welfare. The piece makes the point thatgetting off welfare by working is even harder for the rural poor, who oftenhave no access to public transportation, or, surprisingly, phones.                           USAT 's off-lead is an update on the Iraq/weapons inspector situation.The latest is that Iraq continues to block the operations of a U.N. weaponsinspection team, and to threaten to shoot down U.S. surveillance planes. TheWhite House, the paper reports, has warned Saddam Hussein that time is runningout for him to avoid "firm action." The Iraq story is also carried on theNYT front, and in the "world-wide news" box on the front of theWSJ , but doesn't make the front of the LAT . Or of the WP ,which runs it on p. 14.            The WP runs a piece inside on the first-ever World Bank study ofAIDS, released yesterday. The piece opens with the report's observation that,"About 2.3 billion people, roughly half the population of the developing world,live in places where the AIDS epidemic has barely begun, and even mildlysuccessful prevention programs could have enormous benefits." By contrast, theNYT inside piece on the study emphasizes not the possibilities ofprevention, but the scope of the disease's surge, saving for its 13th paragraphthe material that the Post leads with, about the relative scarcity ofthe disease for about half the world. As if to back up its more alarmist take,the NYT runs a front-page piece about how AIDS is suddenly ravishingKaliningrad, a city of 400,000 that connects Russia with Europe.            Back to the 209 decision: It seems that the majors have picked up theHollywood habit of overlooking the writer. Like stars on Oscar night, thepapers' coverage of the 209 victory mentions such proponents as Pete Wilson andWard Connerly, but there is no front-page mention of Tom Wood or GlynnClustred, who wrote and conceived 209 in the first place.
