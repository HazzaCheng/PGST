                                 Lucent Should Stick With What It Knows                        For a company whose roots are in Bell Labs, source of innumerabletechnological breakthroughs, Lucent is surprisingly unembarrassed about buyingtechnology that it can't, or doesn't want, to build itself. Since it was spunoff from AT&T three years ago, Lucent has made 29 acquisitions at a cost of$32 billion, including a major deal it closed today, when it agreed to acquireExcel Switching Corp. for $1.7 billion.            While it's now well known that at least half of all mergers fail--in thesense that they destroy rather than create shareholder value--it's also becomewell known that certain companies are exceptionally good at integratingacquisitions into their existing operations. Not coincidentally, perhaps, twoof the best are competitors, namely Lucent and Cisco (which, reader beware, Iown shares in). Cisco, in fact, closed a small deal today, spending $143million to acquire MaxComm Technologies, which specializes in high-speed Netaccess. And before the year is out, expect Lucent and Cisco to announce moredeals. It's a kind of acquisition arms race.            For the most part, the logic behind that race is compelling. Lucent, withits roots in more traditional telephone equipment, is trying to move stronglyinto computer and data networks. Cisco, for its part, wants to build on itsalready commanding position in data networking, even as it shifts more and moreof its business to take advantage of the explosion in the Internet. And withtechnology shifting and developing as rapidly as it is, it's difficult (let'ssay impossible) for any company to keep everything in-house. Instead, smallercompanies create and develop technology, and Cisco and Lucent step in, buy upthese companies with their pricey stock, and reap the benefits. Needless tosay, this strategy works only if you're good at bringing companies on boardwithout wrecking them or yourself. Both Lucent and Cisco are.            The danger in all this, though, is overreaching, stretching a company beyondwhat it's really good at. Take last week's $3.7 billion acquisition by Lucentof International Network Services, a telecom consulting firm that helpscompanies design, install, and maintain computer and data networks. The dealwas hailed by analysts and the press as a powerful move by Lucent into"services," offering the possibility that companies will now be able to come toLucent for one-stop shopping. Not only will we sell you the equipment, Lucentcan now promise, but we'll help you install it and keep it running. Hell, we'lleven tell you why you should buy it in the first place.            That last point signals one of the obvious problems with the deal, which isthat INS's business depends on the fact that companies trust it to give themthe best advice possible. If, every time a company asks an INS consultant whatkind of system it should install, the consultant says, "Why, Lucent, ofcourse," companies aren't going to be trusting INS much longer.            But even aside from that, this was a dubious acquisition, because in essenceLucent paid $3.7 billion to buy a business whose profit margins and earningsgrowth are significantly lower than Lucent's. This may seem counterintuitive,given that all you hear about lately is how important it is that IBM is movinginto services--i.e., its e-business initiative--or that Hewlett-Packard isrevitalizing itself as a services company. But the truth is that it's better tomake hardware or software than to be in services. Consulting is a finebusiness, on its own terms. But next to making switches or routers--let aloneWindows 98--it's mediocre at best.            The reason is obvious: Services require people, and always will. When you'remaking hardware or, even better, licensing software, all your costs are underyour control, and once the product is actually developed, your profit marginsare very high. And production lines can be automated. Consulting, though, is bydefinition a labor-intensive, time-intensive business. Profit margins are muchlower. INS's net margins--profit divided by revenue--are around 8 percent,while Cisco's are at 20 percent. This is inherent in the nature of thebusiness--Lucent won't be able to change it.            It's understandable, what with the new vogue for one-stop shopping, thatLucent would want to offer services in addition to equipment. But in acquiringINS, Lucent appears to be forgetting one of the most important lessons of thepast two decades: Companies do best when they do only what they do best.
