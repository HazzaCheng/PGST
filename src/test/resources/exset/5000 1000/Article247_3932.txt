                                 What Fools These Mortals Be                        Dear Lisa,            Back for more! It's always fun to share favorite authors. Someone once saidthat the world could be divided into two categories--those who laughed at theThree Stooges and those who wondered why. Not to stretch the Dawn/Curly analogytoo far, but you know what I mean.            As for my editing process, I've messed with the letters somewhat less than Idid with the diaries, for the simple reason that Dawn had already edited theletters before she sent them out. With the diaries, she was writing solely forherself (at least in theory) and sometimes became a little sloppy or redundant,as we will in purely personal jottings or first drafts. Since I already felt alittle uncomfortable publishing the diaries--I'd never want that done to me!--Ithought it important to tidy her up here and there. (All of the words in thepublished Diaries are Dawn's own, but some of the external structuresare mine.)            With the letters, I've trimmed them and occasionally deleted passages andnames, but otherwise they're pretty much as she wrote them. Although it's a"reading edition," from the start I've always tried to be a Powell purist. Asyou know, when the marvelous Steerforth press brought out one of Dawn's genuinemasterpieces, originally released as The Tenth Moon , I asked them tocall it Come Back to Sorrento , for that was Powell's title--and we knowfrom her diaries that she was furious about the name her publishers hadinflicted on her. Moreover, I've asked Steerforth not to reissue Whither(1925), which was the first novel that she published. It's not quite as bad asshe thought it was, but since she spent the rest of her life buying up any copyshe found and destroying it and never mentioned it in any lists of her work, Ithink it ought to rest in peace, don't you?            John Howard Lawson (1894-1977) was a gifted and original playwright.Unfortunately, he was also a philanderer--what they used to call a "ladiesman"--as well as a rigid Stalinist. As such, he was hardly Dawn's type--can youimagine her mouthing Marxian jargon with any sort of straight face?--but heseems to have been the great romantic love of her life, after her husband, towhom it should be remembered that she remained married for 42 years. I believethat Powell's third novel, The Bride's House (not one of her best butvery interesting for a biographer), is deeply autobiographical. It was writtenat the beginning of her probable affair with Lawson, while she was also stillliving at home with her husband and son, and it is wracked with privatehaunting.            And yes--I think Powell had a tough life, certainly a difficult one, but itwas also, as you say, a good life as well in its way. Her humor was the key, Ithink; that, and her passion for work. It can safely be said that Powell livedto write; her art, so rich in its laughter (even in some passages of hersaddest books), buoyed her up. How could she have stood all that she wentthrough otherwise--an impaired son, a difficult marriage, recurring healthproblems, impoverishment, and what was essentially a period of homelessness(this last when she was in her 60s)? She was one strong woman, and humor washer shield.            I agree with you that sexism likely played a part in her longunderappreciation. On the other hand, I have found that some feminists activelyresent Powell for making fun of her gender as brilliantly as she made fun ofmen. I think the literary left was unhappy that her workers were likely to beas silly as her bosses. I think social conservatives were unhappy with all ofthose Powell characters who drank too much, slept around, behaved foolishly,and yet remained funny, agreeable company. Powell was never an "uplifter." Shewas an equal-opportunity satirist, and took her fun where she found it. She hassome of the bright, distanced amusement we find in the best comedies of Greekand Roman antiquity.            Or, if you prefer, she echoes Shakespeare--"What fools these mortals be!"And we are. But she liked us anyway.            Yours till next time,Tim
