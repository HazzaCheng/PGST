                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        Before we get to this week's Cocktail Chatter, I have a correction to make.In Tuesday's column about the Federal Reserve's use of symbolic action to guideinterest rates in the right direction, I wrote that the Fed's adoption of aneutral bias was a shift from its earlier stance. In fact, the Fed had alreadyadopted a neutral bias at its previous meeting, shifting from a bias towardtightening. What threw me was that it's relatively unusual for the Fed to raiseinterest rates off a neutral bias, but that is in fact what happened this week.The bond market, meanwhile, seemed so concerned about inflation that it felt asif the Fed was leaning toward tightening. (Which it did do.) So when the Fedannounced that it was staying neutral, it felt like a change.            All of the above is true, but I still shouldn't have made the mistake.Apologies.            In no small part because of that interest-rate hike, it was a roaring weekin the stock market. Before today's minor sell-off, the Dow had been up 3.3percent in the previous seven trading days, while the Nasdaq was up an amazing7 percent. It used to be that interest-rate hikes were automatic bad news forstocks, since the idea behind the hike is that it will slow down the economyand, presumably, profits. But this economy seems so strong that the danger ofhaving the boom killed by inflation--which would eventually lead to very sharpinterest-rate hikes-- feels more powerful than the danger of having the boomkilled by a slowdown. So as long as the interest-rate hikes remain manageable,the stock market welcomes them. Who knows how long this will last, but rightnow, investors seem to feel that if things are stable, the only answer is tobuy. You can't keep a buoyant market down. Which is, I suppose, why you wouldcall it "buoyant." Anyway, on to the Chatter.            1. "The International Monetary Fund admitted--well, I say 'admitted' becauseit sounds more dramatic than 'said'--that it has no idea whether money itloaned to Russia's central bank was improperly diverted by Russian banksfurther down the line, because the IMF leaves the monitoring of disbursementsto central banks. Now, we're not asking the fund to hire someone named Vito togo collect, but considering that it's now loaned Russia $20 billion with fewdiscernible results, maybe making one or two phone calls wouldn't beunreasonable . You know, something like: 'So, how much of that $20 billionis still around? Really? Well, a kickback here and a payoff there do add up.No, I understand.'"            2. "As expected, Ecuador announced that it would miss a scheduled$94 million interest payment on its Brady bonds but insisted that it wasnot defaulting, just deferring to a later date. 'Does anybody really know whattime it is? Does anybody really care?' the finance minister reportedlysaid."            3. "Daily Variety headline for an article on Virgin Records'purchase of Immortal Film and Music : 'Virgin Picks Up Immortal.' So whatkind of line do you have to use to get Apollo to come home with you,anyway?"            4. "Opening today in theaters everywhere is a film based on that great'children's classic,' A Dog of Flanders . I'm sorry, but is thereanyone outside of Flanders who considers this a classic? Are there any Americanchildren who have even heard of Flanders, let alone the dogs that come fromthere?"            5. "Merrill Lynch's powerful media analyst Jessica Reif Cohen jolted TimeWarner's stock price Tuesday when she cut her earnings estimates for thecompany, citing a disappointing performance by Time Warner's musicdivision. Oddly, though, what the cuts did was bring Cohen's estimates in linewith those of most other analysts who follow the company. The definition ofauthority: You can agree with an already-existing consensus and still have itmake news."            6. "Richard Belluzzo resigned as chairman and CEO of SiliconGraphics, after spending 19 months trying to turn around the company. He thentook a job with Microsoft , heading up all its Internet operations ...Hey, wait a minute. Let me rephrase my opening sentence: The visionary RichardBelluzzo resigned as chairman and CEO of Silicon Graphics, after dedicating 19valiant months to turning around that company."
