                                 Goldhagen's Willing Executioners            Last year, while browsing atone of those sadly disappearing Upper West Side bookstores, I ran into NormanFinkelstein, a member of the sadly disappearing tribe of left-wing gadflies.Finkelstein said he was working on a book about Harvard Professor Daniel JonahGoldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and theHolocaust . Goldhagen, he declared, was a fraud crying out to beunmasked.            Thiswasn't surprising. Goldhagen made a lot of people angry with that book.(Click here for a quick refresher on why.) Finkelstein, a politicalscientist, bills himself a "forensic" scholar. He's fashioned a career out ofdemystifying what he deems pseudoscholarly arguments. It also made a kind ofpoetic sense that Finkelstein would become obsessed with Goldhagen. Like him,Finkelstein is the son of Holocaust survivors and a strident commentator onJewish affairs. He just comes at them from the opposing side.            Finkelstein's reputation rests on his refutation of JoanPeters' 1984 From Time Immemorial , a book purporting to provePalestinian Arabs had no claims on the land that is now Israel, having beendrawn to it only by reports that Jews were making the desert bloom. Peters'book was lavishly praised by American Jewish organizations, novelists, andscholars. But when Finkelstein showed that Peters had manipulated Ottomandemographic records to make her case, the book's supporters attacked him as ananti-Zionist. By 1986, though, Zionist scholars having published articles thatbolstered Finkelstein's case, his version was the conventional wisdom.            Finkelstein told me Goldhagen was just another Peters. That struck me asdubious. After all, Goldhagen's book wasn't a hoax. It was a troublinginterpretation. But Finkelstein insisted that, whatever the reviewers said, thebook had been a megapublishing event, and for one simple reason: It was usefulto Zionist Jews who believe that all non-Jews are potential Jew killers andthat Jews, therefore, are justified in using whatever means are necessary todefend themselves.            Calling Goldhagen a Zionist propagandist seemedan act of provocation, to say the least, and so it was taken. Last summer,Finkelstein published an article with the lurid title "Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's'Crazy' Thesis" in the British New Left Review . Shortly afterward, itwas excerpted in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and in Italy'sPanorama . Goldhagen promptly denounced Finkelstein as asupporter of Hamas, a radical Islamic Palestinian group. MetropolitanBooks, an imprint of Holt, decided to publish a revised version ofFinkelstein's essay, along with a no less hotly contested attack on Goldhagenby the German-born historian Ruth Bettina Birn that was first published in theCambridge Historical Journal .            Severalmonths before the publication of Finkelstein and Birn's book, A Nation onTrial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth , Finkelstein's opponentspressured Metropolitan to cancel it. Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor ofthe New Republic , got on the phone with his friend Michael Naumann, thepublisher of Holt and a German, to express his outrage.The Anti-Defamation League's Abraham Foxman wrote to Finkelstein's editor, SaraBershtel, calling the writer's views "beyond the pale."            Finkelstein's co-author took even worse flak. Goldhagenaccused her of having defamed him in her Historical Journal article,then assembled a team of lawyers in Britain to demand a retraction and anapology. In Canada, the Canadian Jewish Congress is trying to have Birn removedfrom the government's war crimes division (where she helps build cases againstNazi war criminals) on the grounds that, by publishing with Finkelstein, shehas demonstrated insensitivity unbecoming a public servant.            Theprepublication attack almost worked. Istvn Dek, a Columbia Universityhistorian who agreed to write a preface, backed out. He didprovide a blurb, as did seven other distinguished academics, including theHolocaust experts Raul Hilberg and Christopher Browning, the French Jewishintellectual Pierre Vidal-Naquet, and the eminent Marxist historian EricHobsbawm. (Click here to read what some of them say and here to read why they say it.) Now that the book is out, thegrand irony is that Goldhagen should consider himself lucky to have Finkelsteinas his adversary. Not that it isn't a good dissection of Goldhagen'scontradictions and distortions. Finkelstein handily refutes Goldhagen's claimthat German anti-Semitism is all that's required to explain the Holocaust.(Click here to read how he does this.) Checking Goldhagen's assertionsagainst his citations, Finkelstein demonstrates that the scholar's use ofsecondary sources is untrustworthy. (Click here for anothertelling example.) And yet Finkelstein turns out to be a kind of doppelgnger ofGoldhagen's, equally biased and inflammatory.            First, Finkelstein makes much of the point thatthe majority of Germans "did not cast their lot for Hitler." Technicallytrue--but a plurality of Germans did. No party received as many votes in theMarch 1933 election as the Nazis--43.9 percent. Finkelstein acknowledges theNazi state was a brutal dictatorship, but he glosses over its disturbinglypopular character.            Second,Finkelstein echoes conventional historical thinking when he says Nazism's mainappeal lay in Hitler's promises to restore order in post-Weimar Germany, endunemployment, and make the country an international power. But anti-Semitismpermeated Nazi ideology, and Finkelstein is deaf to its nuances. He writes,"Not the Jews but Marxism and Social Democracy served as the prime scapegoatsof Nazi propaganda" during their rise to power. Also technically true. But theNazis perceived Social Democracy as a Jewish party and Marxism as a Jewishcreed; when they rallied against Bolshevik enemies, their audiences did notneed to be told that these enemies were, if not actual Jews, then "spiritualJews." If Finkelstein were to apply his logic to Lee Atwater's Willie Hortonstrategy, he'd have to write, "Not race but crime served as the prime scapegoatof George Bush's 1988 campaign."            Third, Finkelstein deduces from some Germans' disgust atthe destruction of Jewish lives and property during Nazi-sponsored pogroms suchas Kristallnacht that "Germans overwhelmingly condemned the Nazianti-Semitic atrocities." If they did, they gave new meaning to the term"silent majority." The Germans, he writes, displayed "the callousness towardhuman life typically attending war. ... Hardened and bitter, in search of ascapegoat, they occasionally lashed out at the weak." The first adverb casuallybanalizes German brutality; the second diminishes its extent; together, theycome dangerously close to apologia.            The mostcontroversial part of Finkelstein's book, though, is the last chapter, in whichhe sets out to explain why the Goldhagen book was such a big deal. Finkelsteinobserves that after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, there was a boom in the kind ofHolocaust literature that portrayed the catastrophe as the natural culminationof millennial Jew-hatred. Where some Holocaust experts, such as Hilberg andMartin Broszat, depicted it as a "complex and contingent event," other writers,such as Lucy Davidowicz, found it more "politically expedient" to focus onanti-Semitism, especially as Israel came under increasing censure. (Clickhere for Finkelstein's explanation of why this logic is"expedient.") According to Finkelstein, Goldhagen's claim that all forms ofanti-Semitism "tend toward a genocidal 'solution' " is expedient in this way,and therefore popular--though Finkelstein says Goldhagen adds no more than aveneer of social science sophistication to this reductionist point of view.            Finkelstein is not breaking new ground here.Israeli intellectuals such as Amos Elon and Tom Segev and the Holocausthistorian Omer Bartov have made similar points about ideologicalsubtext of Holocaust writing. But they also take pains not to dismiss thetrauma the Holocaust visited and continues to visit upon Jews. By contrast,Finkelstein adopts an ugly conspiratorial tone when he attributes the book'spopularity in the United States to its Zionist message. This is nonsense. Thebook owed its commercial success to its soothingly simplistic thesis--and toastute marketing. At times, Finkelstein's tone even veers toward the jocular,as when he makes fun of Elie Wiesel's racist remarks about ungrateful blackpeople. One is reminded of Gershom Scholem's remark to Hannah Arendt at thetime of Eichmann in Jerusalem : "This is not the way to approach thescene of that tragedy."            It's too bad that the noiseabout Finkelstein has drowned out his co-writer, Birn. She knows the archivesbetter than anyone, and she has come up with more quietly damning observations.Birn's experience as a prosecutor gives her a radically different take on thelegal testimony Goldhagen bases much of his book on, for the most partconfessions of death squad members. "Goldhagen seems to have difficultycomprehending that when perpetrators claim to have been motivated by Nazipropaganda, it need not be sincere," she writes. (Click here to see how these statements could instead form part of alegal defense.) Birn also shows how Goldhagen's insistence on German complicityleads him to soft-pedal the anti-Semitism of the Germans' collaborators,referring obliquely to the "pressures operating on the Ukrainians that did notexist for the Germans." This is flat-out Eastern European revisionism; youcould easily imagine some Ukrainian nationalist writing it.            But theweightiest of Birn's accusations is that Goldhagen glosses over atrocities inwhich the victims weren't Jewish. Goldhagen recounts the tale of a witness whosaw a Russian man beaten to death because his name was Abraham; he does notreport the same witness's account, on the next page of testimony, of the"sexually sadistic murder of a young [non-Jewish] girl by one of the officers."In the end, this may be one of the most compelling condemnations of Goldhagenyet: that his focus on Jewish victims leaves him indifferent to the fate ofnon-Jews, from that young girl to the millions of Soviet POW's who were starvedand worked to death in the camps. Without minimizing the significance ofanti-Semitism, Birn provides an eloquent rejoinder to Goldhagen'sblood-thinking. Her essay radiates a dignified humanism that both Goldhagen andFinkelstein lack.                           Endnotes                        Note 1: Holocaust historians have traditionally offered avariety of reasons why Germans followed orders to exterminate the Jews. Theseinclude anti-Semitism, the culture of German military units, the pressures oftotalitarian rule, the hysteria of wartime mobilization, and the effects ofNazi propaganda. Goldhagen, by contrast, offers a single-bullet explanation. Heposits a society of ordinary Germans bred, like attack dogs, to despise Jews,and unleashed by a regime that shared their bloodlust. Germany's uniquelyanti-Semitic history had, in his view, made most of them "assenting massexecutioners ... [who] considered the slaughter to be just." The book had itsdefenders, but the reviews were mostly scathing. Hitler's WillingExecutioners was dismissed as fundamentally ahistorical inCommentary , of all places, and as a "bizarre inversion of the Nazi viewof the Jews as an insidious, inherently evil nation" in the NewRepublic .Back            Note 2: This was an unfair characterization of Finkelstein'sviews on the Oslo accords. Like Edward Said, who regards the Oslo accords as aPalestinian Versailles, he is opposed to them. That doesn't make him a Hamassupporter. Back            Note 3: According to Finkelstein's editor, Sara Bershtel,who was in Naumann's office at the time and heard Wieseltier on the speakerphone, he said: "Michael, you don't know who Finkelstein is. He's poison, he'sa disgusting self-hating Jew, he's something you find under a rock." Wieseltiertold me he wasn't trying to silence Finkelstein: "The idea that anyone istrying to suppress the lonely prophet in the wilderness called Finkelstein iscomical. Virtually every scholar has attacked [Goldhagen's] book, including, Imight add, our critic in the New                Republic . Finkelstein is justplaying this game of pater les juifs ." Back            Note 4: Dek, who was so impressed by an early draftFinkelstein sent him that he wrote him praising his efforts, now says, "Ididn't read the article very carefully. I made the mistake of giving my consenttoo early, and then had second thoughts." Back            Note 5: "All readers of Goldhagen's controversial book should take noteof these much-needed studies, which, in line with serious historians,convincingly and authoritatively dismantle its arguments."            -- EricHobsbawm, author of The Age of Extremes: A History of the World,1914-1991            "In this important volumeFinkelstein and Birn demonstrate that Daniel Goldhagen's study of the Judeocideis monocausal, teleological, and severely blinkered. Finkelstein carefully setsforth Goldhagen's distortion and disregard of the secondary literature; Birnmasterfully lays bare his gravely flawed use and interpretation of archivalsources. Both authors also raise hard questions about the political reasons forthe inordinate promotion and reception of Goldhagen's book. No serious studentof history can afford to ignore these well-reasoned and withering reflectionson the perils of pseudo-scholarship."            -- ArnoMayer, author of Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?: The Final Solution inHistory            "Finkelstein and Birnprovide a devastating critique of Daniel Goldhagen's simplistic and misleadinginterpretation of the Holocaust. Their contribution to the debate is, in myview, indispensable."            -- IanKershaw, author of Hitler            "Among the dozens ofreviewers of Hitler's Willing Executioners , Ruth Bettina Birn and NormanFinkelstein stand out for the seriousness and thoroughness with which they haveundertaken their task. Even if I do not embrace every aspect of Finkelstein'sconclusions concerning the politicization of Holocaust historiography, I amgrateful for these writers' courageous, conscientious, and labor-intensiveefforts."            -- Christopher Browning, author of Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion101 and the Final Solution in Poland            "Is Daniel Goldhagen'sHitler's Willing Executioners the definitive work on Hitler's Judeocide?The authors of this volume express serious doubt, which I share. To reduce aphenomenon of this scale and complexity to the anti-Semitism which permeatedGerman society as it also permeated other societies is to be simplistic and toshow contempt for the reader. This book rights the balance."            -- Pierre Vidal-Naquet, author of The Jews: History, Memory, and thePresent            "Highly recommended to themany readers of Goldhagen's controversial book, especially those who weremesmerized by its hypotheses. Fortunately, in an open society all scholarshipis subject to public scrutiny, and the advance of historical knowledge cannotdo without rigorous criticism of the kind provided in this important andcourageous collection."            -- Volker R. Berghahn, J.P. Birkelund distinguished professor of Europeanhistory, Brown University                        "Birn's and Finkelstein'sessays constitute a sharp rebuttal provoked by the public's and the press'slove affair with a book that casually dismisses excellent work done by others;that contains many contradictions; and that upholds dangerous myths regardingthe existence of 'national characteristics.' "            -- Istvn Dek, author of Beyond Nationalism: A Social and PoliticalHistory of the Habsburg Officer Corps, 1848-1918Back            Note 6: Christopher Browning told me: "What's importantabout Finkelstein's critique is that he has traced the inconsistencies andcontradictions in Goldhagen, and no one else has taken the time to do that.It's not my style of writing. But I don't think he's gone beyond the bounds ofpolemic in replying to Goldhagen's polemic." In interviews, Holocaust scholarssounded grateful that someone had stood up so boldly to Goldhagen, who, inHitler's Willing Executioners , had dismissed the work of virtually everyscholar who came before him. Two of the blurb writers have quite understandablegrudges: Goldhagen has, for years, been railing against Browning's emphasis onpeer pressure in explaining why German soldiers participated in genocide; in aNew                Republic review, he accused another endorser, Arno Mayer, ofbeing a Holocaust revisionist. In any event, these blurbs often appear to bemore the expressions of well-wishers than of close readers. Hobsbawm is notalone in saying he didn't read Finkelstein's essay "line-by-line." Back            Note 7: Finkelstein notes that anti-Semitism in othercountries was often worse; there was, in pre-Hitler Germany, "no equivalent ofthe riots that attended the Dreyfus Affair in France or the pogroms in Russia."In the Weimar period, moreover, the Nationalist Socialists found they couldn'tget much mileage out of raw appeals to anti-Jewish prejudice, and often toneddown their anti-Semitism around election time. Back            Note 8: Footnoting historian Peter Pulzer's sober studyJews and the German State , Goldhagen asserts that only the "core of thesocialist movement, its intellectuals and leaders" opposed anti-Semitism. Infact, Pulzer says no such thing. He found little evidence of anti-Semitismamong Social Democrats, intellectuals or workers. Back            Note 9: "Thus interpreted, the Nazi extermination bothjustifies the necessity of Israel and accounts for all hostility directed atit: The Jewish state is the only safeguard against the next outbreak ofhomicidal anti-Semitism and, conversely, homicidal anti-Semitism is behindevery attack on, or even defensive maneuver against, the Jewish state. 'TheHolocaust' is in effect the Zionist account of the Nazi holocaust."Back            Note 10: Among other things, they warn against the dangerof removing the Holocaust from history and turning it into a sort of secularreligion, the central symbol of Jewish identity. They also deplore theinvocation of the Holocaust as a justification for policies that most Jewswould deplore if they were implemented in their own countries. Back            Note 11: Goldhagen asserts the German police battalionsknew of the planned destruction of the Jews before entering the Soviet Union,rather than two months after, as most historians believe. He bases this claimon the "conclusive" statement of two former storm troopers. In fact, theirstatements about extermination orders from above evolved over time, Birnexplains, as part of a "defense focused on superior orders as anexcuse."Back
