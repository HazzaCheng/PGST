                                 Remembering the Holocaust                           A Fine-TunedInstrumentalization                                       Editor's note: What follows in an exchange between Peter Novick, authorof The Holocaust in American Life , and James Young, one of theparticipants in last week's "," in which Novick's book was discussed. Bothletters are reprinted with the authors' permission.                        DearJames,            I am appealing to James at leisure to overturn thejudgment of James in haste. I apologize for the fact that, as with manyappellate briefs, detailing the grounds for the appeal will require a fairamount of space.            In your exchange with Philip Gourevitch about mybook The Holocaust in American Life , you wrote the following, apropos ofwhat you termed "the so-called 'lessons of the Holocaust,' or why we recall theHolocaust at all": "I would suggest, contra Novick, that not everyinstitutional memory of the Holocaust is a deliberate instrumentalization of ittoward cheap and self-interested ends." You add that I am "actually quite goodat ferreting out many of the instances where this is, indeed, the case."            I'm not sure what the word "institutional" meanshere--i.e., how an institution remembers. Holocaust memory, of course, becomes"institutionalized" in curricula; in a "canon" of Holocaust literature; morediffusely, institutionalized in popular--particularly Jewish--consciousness.Let's turn to "instrumentalization"--a word which appears to carry a strongnegative charge for you. As you know, I never myself use that word (or itscognates) concerning collective memory. The reason, made clear more than oncein the book, is that I think collective memories that really take holdalways do so because they serve a present or continuing purpose. That isto say, memories take hold to the extent that they are--if one wants to use theword--"instrumental" for some purpose. As you will recall, I make a partialexception for certain forms of religious (or civic-religious) commemoration atthe very beginning of my chapter on "lessons": "Remembering the Holocaust,especially for Jews, needs no pragmatic justification. It is an act of pietyanalogous to reciting the Mourner's Kaddish on the anniversary of a relative'sdeath, to the remembrance of war dead on Memorial Day." In the introduction, Ipoint out that historically, Jewish memory--even religious memory--has beenselective: Events that seem to contemporaries to point up a useful contemporarylesson are incorporated into collective memory; those that don't seem to teachuseful lessons recede, though they may be recovered later, as perceptionschange about what lessons are useful. And, a fortiori, this is true of secularmemory. Thus, for me , to say that a collective memory is "instrumental"is to say nothing that isn't implicit in its being a collective memory.For me , to say that Holocaust memory is "instrumentalized" says nothingworth saying, and certainly nothing invidious or discreditable.            For you (and others)"instrumentalization" is invidious--and discreditable. By not explainingwhy it is invidious--simply taking this for granted--and saying that Itreat Holocaust memory in America as all "instrumental," you attribute to methe view that American Holocaust memory is somehow discreditable. I think weought to explore how you use the word, and thus the view you're attributing tome. Are you saying that memories in general, or memories of the Holocaust inparticular, are "instrumentalized" when they are used for unworthy , orat least inappropriate purposes? Let's consider those purposes for whichthe memory of the Holocaust has been invoked, which are the ones I discussmost in my book. These include both "Jewish-specific" and "general"purposes:                           To rouse the conscience of the world about perceived threats to "the JewsHitler missed" in Israel.               To reinforce Jewish solidarity, so that having survived Hitler, Jews willnot disappear through assimilation.               To warn Jews to watch out for early warning signs of rising anti-Semitismin America--signs that were ignored in Germany.               To urge that the United States intervene against atrocities abroad whichare said to resemble the Holocaust.               To teach tolerance and brotherhood--especially in schools.                        Can we agree that these are the "lessons of theHolocaust" to which I devote the most space in the book? Which of them do youthink unworthy or inappropriate--and why? I wouldn't myself describe them thatway--and in the book I don't. To be sure, in invoking the Holocaust for these(to me) worthy and appropriate purposes, those doing so were often led toexcess: for example, exaggerating Israel's peril or American anti-Semitism.But that was my point . As I wrote in the book, "Once one starts usingimagery from the Holocaust--that most extreme of events--it becomes impossibleto say anything moderate, balanced, or nuanced; the very language carries youalong to hyperbole." But the ends for which the Holocaust was (to useyour word) "instrumentalized" seemed to me then and seem to me now both worthyand appropriate.            Or perhaps, for you, "instrumentalization" hingeson motive : Perhaps you believe the Holocaust was invoked for these ends"cynically" or "insincerely"? This may, in isolated instances, have been true,but I can't recall ever either saying or implying that this was the case.Certainly, overall, I repeatedly underlined the sincerity of those whohave invoked the Holocaust. Indeed, I extend this to some of the less"mainstream" invocations--those that many, perhaps including yourself, thinkunworthy or inappropriate. As you may recall, I underlined the good faith ofthose who saw an analogy between the denial of the humanity of the fetus andthe Nazi slogan "life unworthy of life." I am myself conventionally"pro-choice," but I would think it a dubious procedure to make that thecriterion of when it was illegitimate to invoke the Holocaust, reserving themantle of legitimacy for causes--like humanitarian intervention, or thepromotion of brotherhood and tolerance--of which I approve. If you differ withme on this, it would have been appropriate for you to say: "Novick isexcessively tolerant of invocations of the Holocaust which I and many othersthink quite intolerable." But you didn't say that: You said that I believe that"every institutional memory of the Holocaust is a deliberateinstrumentalization of it toward cheap and self-interested ends."            Let's turn to "cheap and self-interested." Thereare indeed invocations of the Holocaust to which I'd apply this description. Ina section devoted to miscellaneous ways in which the Holocaust had enteredAmerican discourse, I listed a few cases in which I thought this was so,mentioning Hillary Clinton, Woody Allen, and a handful of others. To this onemight add the single paragraph I devote to the origin of the WashingtonHolocaust Museum, which, as you wrote in your Holocaust Memorials inHistory , was "proposed by then-president Jimmy Carter to placate Jewishsupporters angered by his sale of F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia." In all,two pages of the 281 pages in the book.            You write that I am "quite good at ferreting out"instances of "instrumentalization of [the Holocaust] toward cheap andself-interested ends." Ferret that I am, I indeed accumulated quite acollection of such instances, along with instances of what you elsewhere termthe Holocaust's "commodification." There was Judy Chicago, selling Holocaustjewelry to raise money for her (stupid and vulgar) painting cycle on thesubject. There was--my personal favorite--the travel agency advertising a"Jewish Singles Weekend," the high point of which was a visit to the WashingtonHolocaust Museum. Of these, or the many other similar examples I've collected,there is no mention in the book . The reason that I didn't mention themwas that to do so seemed to me "a cheap shot"--concentrating on the ephemeraland the inconsequential--the scummy froth atop the waves of any discourse.            There are real differences between us ininterpreting the rise of Holocaust memory in the United States. As analternative to my approach, in which the growth in Holocaust memory is to beexplained by the contemporary purposes it serves, you suggest a focus on theJewish tradition of remembering catastrophes. These traditional reasons, yousay "explain its significance for many [Jews] at a preconscious level, whetherwe like it or not." I think there is something to this, which is why Idiscussed it, albeit briefly, in the book. For various reasons, I don't thinkthis explains much about the evolution of American Jewish memory of theHolocaust. Still, yours is certainly an arguable position, which we can discusssometime. If you'd said in                   Slate                that you thought I didn't talkenough about this, that would have been a reasonable comment. But you went waybeyond that--counterposing your traditional/cultural hypothesis to my allegedview that "every institutional memory of the Holocaust is a deliberateinstrumentalization of it toward cheap and self-interested ends." Is that theonly possible alternative to your view?            I can suggest a possibility about how such anunjust and demonstrably false characterization of my views came to appear inyour message to [Philip] Gourevitch. That possibility has to do with therapid-fire e-mail exchange format of                   Slate               's "Book Club" in whichit appeared. You wrote in response to an e-mail by Gourevitch "postmarked" justtwo hours earlier. You were in fact offering it, as you'll see if you go backto the original, not as a considered characterization of my views, but as a wayof introducing your own "traditional/cultural" explanation.            But of course, once made, and available forexcerpting, it became a (highly quotable) characterization of my views.The "conversational illusion" that e-mail promotes seduces us into the kind ofcareless hyperbole common to conversation. In real conversations, araised eyebrow can be enough to make us backtrack. Something like this happensin private e-mail exchanges. I can't count the occasions on which I saidsomething in a message that my correspondent challenged. In the next messageI'd find myself saying something like, "Of course, you're right. I overstated.What I should have said, meant to say, was ..." But in your e-mail exchangewith Gourevitch, your characterization of my views wasn't challenged.And unlike hyperbolic remarks in private exchanges, buried in the innards ofour computers, this one went out to God-knows-how-many thousands of"eavesdroppers." Can you have any doubt that given your reputation as afair-minded and circumspect commentator on these matters your characterizationwill be widely quoted as an authoritative summary of my views?            If you want it to be soquoted, you'll of course let it stand. If, on reflection, you want to withdrawwhat I hope you'll acknowledge was a hasty and careless characterization, youcan do so here.            -- Peter Novick                        Professor of history            University of Chicago            Dear Peter,            Given the narrowness of both my hastycharacterization of your position (vis--vis "instrumentalization") and of yourown objection to my characterization, I'm glad to be able to come back and saynow that my words were unfair to your much more complex approach to "the usesof the Holocaust." It was especially unfair to put a word in your mouth,"intrumentalization," which you have taken pains to avoid--and for very goodreasons. I'm sorry.            At the same time, I wouldn't characterize my ownposition as reflexively knee jerk against instrumentalization, in that I findevery memory, institutional or otherwise, "instrumentalizes" to some degree.Which is partly why you wisely dispense with the term.            In this, it would be a little too easy to blame therapid-fire format for my misstating of your approach to the"instrumentalization" (my word, not yours) of the Holocaust. I takeresponsibility, apologize for my haste, and accept your raised eyebrow. As aformat, I think                   Slate               's Book Club can provide just the kind offresh first-response to books and ideas that the editors had in mind. But alongwith these rewards come risks in such a rapid exchange, something both the"reviewers" and readers need to keep in mind.            The conversationcontinues ... Until next word, I send            --Very best wishes,            JamesE. Young                           Race Matters                        I found Michael Brus' comparison of racialprofiling and affirmative action ("") simplistic and misleading. He fails toprovide a realistic definition of affirmative action and does not address theissues that would provide a context for it.            Affirmative action allows that, given twocandidates of equal qualifications, an institution may favor the candidate thathelps it achieve its affirmative action goals. The legitimacy of these goalscomes not only from notions of "social justice" but also from the desire tooffer a more effective educational environment, a more hospitable workplace, ora more effective school system. In public schools, for example, theeffectiveness of offering students role models with similar ethnic or racialbackgrounds is widely accepted.            But the defect in Brus' article is not that hefails to recognize these benefits, or even disagrees with them, but that henever gets to how this reasoning is implemented in affirmative action programsin a manner that is quite different from what goes on with racialprofiling.            Racial profiling (as practiced in New Jersey)simply singles out people of color for harassment by police. It is a convenientway to select drivers for traffic stops that happens to accord with the racistnotions that seem to flourish in law enforcement.            Affirmative actioncelebrates the cultural diversity of our country and seeks to create a moreinclusive economy and public life. It recognizes that talent and ability aredistributed across the population and that it requires extra effort to avoidexcluding parts of the population that have traditionally been excluded. Racialprofiling is merely a way for racist police officers to express their bigotryat the expense of our civil rights. It doesn't stop crime and it doesn't buildcommunity. That Michael Brus can find no difference between these practices--orthat he is willing to attribute it all to the "fudge factor"--shows he doesn'tget it. He does us all a disservice by offering up this superficialcomparison.            -- Rick Pressler                        NewBrunswick, N.J.

I assume his purposes were to keepingratiating himself with the big boss as well as getting a lot of readerfeedback.            I have been on quite a few development teams andwas waiting for a few honest comments. They were there but buried. The truth,as I have seen it, lies in the SWAT team that tried to keep code trim, combinedwith the greedy rush to keep ahead of competitors' introductions.            Given enough skill and time, good programmers couldwrite much, much smaller programs with the same or more features, includingbackward compatibility with older products. It is rushed, lazy, or incompetentcoding that takes the easy ways out.            These programs areflabby only partially because of their feature sets.
