                                  My Father's Estate            A letter from an ill-mannered former high-schoolclassmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase:"I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever aboutmoney. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estatetax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer.            My sister and I have been going through my father'sestate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files tofind bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time tothink about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us.            He did indeed leave somemoney. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal orSports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, becauseof the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastlyless than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous fordefending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long beforehis death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to theInternal Revenue Service.            The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate ofabout 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxedat around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I thinkabout it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives.They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on theexpense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation.When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair ofgray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15years ago.            They never had live-in help. My father washed thedishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever hecould. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to payfor schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled,imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him.They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for theirbedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the mostexpensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home.            They made not one pennyof it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by deprivingthemselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs ofposterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue willprimarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. Theonly possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people whowere less self-disciplined.            There are a few material, tangible items that an assessorwill have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days atWilliams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatlyunderlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some arepoetry.            That's another item my father left: his own poetryand his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at allabstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his verylast years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when shedied, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying itwas that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. Andthere are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworthand Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes laterpublished. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father washardly a writer for the large audience.            Some of them will go tothe Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small andmodest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling becausehe had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are hisfurniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to mebecause they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in hiscloset, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, thecloset smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation inschools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White Housecufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, andclippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and frommy mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blueribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their lovetriumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place avalue on these and have them taxed, too.            But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister.The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacyto his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised indollars and cents.            The example of loyalty and principle: When he hadjust taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of EconomicAdvisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of DustinHoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to seemy father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman hadsigned a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he wasnot loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, thatRon Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and thathe would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy.After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well.            My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound thatlegacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most ofwhich were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought ofdisavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had anappointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several timesextended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles overinflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon.            Long after, when Nixon was blasted as ananti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind;concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel;pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on aman who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to theStein family as RN had been.            "Loyalty." There is noitem for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed.            My father lived his life, especially in the latter years ofit, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find withAmerica, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement ofmankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards,which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizensthe best chance in history for a good life.            When he did consider the failures of American lifein the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note theastonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use forthose who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when hecould see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made forblacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority.            He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. Hesat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo andJuliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to theKennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. Buthe also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federalbuildings, of the statues of Bolvar and George Washington and San Martin. Heappreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of theCosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and ofthe rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., insummer.            This quality ofgratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least notso far.            He appreciated his friends and did not differentiatebetween them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of hislongtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tankwhere he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs.Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspanor the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him,not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once inmy lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect forriches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the richmerited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devoteour lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us ofpursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. Inever knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied fora job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derivedmore pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Clubabout John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations thatpaid him handsomely.            My father's stance against seeking money for its ownsake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to hischildren--cannot be taken by the Treasury.            Pop had a way of putting what I thought of ascatastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing somescriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of thelife I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father wouldexplain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, farahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family andI could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company,for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction ofthe income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren'seducation.)            Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated meunfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he wouldtake care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offerhung in my mind as a last refuge forever.            This reassurance--thatsomehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as wellas in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, andI can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly taxpayment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero.            My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money atall from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve mostproblems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, thatflashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. Hedid inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he wouldnever live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes.He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices butthat there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.)He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuatedby my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the onlymen I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), andthat I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence.            Most of all, my father believed in loving andappreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals fromthe Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who hadbeen a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on manyissues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friendsat the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his threehomes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment atthe Watergate were the others.            He could formattachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking toa Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as "Suvorov," after theRussian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sitson the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces ofpaper in it.            He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 andnever really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literallydreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which hecalled "Route 29") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va.,and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for furtherwork and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he foundit--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills andthose clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written herpoem (which she titled "Only You") and put it back in the file without evertelling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow,whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more timetrying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financialfeature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in herkitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete.            Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice onthe phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. ("He sounds sosweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' " my father said, beaming even with tubes inhim.)            Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for helpthat he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some researchwe were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When Iwas a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, hissimple answer was to say, "Let's do it together. It'll take half as long." Iuse that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father'sexample about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed closewith friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms ofthe CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, classof '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he wentinto the hospital.            This quality of devotionand the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in myfather's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent.Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge.            And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: agood name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or aboutwhen to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in alarge defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with himabout RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, bymeans of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venalreason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honestywas simply without a speck of question upon it.            This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least notright now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keepit clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value.            So, in answer to the query from the forwardhigh-school classmate, "Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, hedid manage to beat the estate tax." The only problem is that I miss him everysingle minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his beinggone, so the death part is pure loss.
