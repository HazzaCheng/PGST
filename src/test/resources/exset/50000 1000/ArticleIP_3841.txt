                                                            (posted Wednesday, Oct.23)                                       FactAbuse                        The "Hey, Wait a Minute"column by Douglas J. Besharov and Jacob W. Dembosky ("Child Abuse: Threat orMenace?") seriously misrepresents the methodology, findings, andconclusions of the recently released Third National Incidence Study of ChildAbuse and Neglect (NIS-3). As the NIS-3 project director and the supervisorresponsible for implementing the NIS-3 definitions, we want to set the recordstraight. We address only some of the misinformation here.            In light of Besharov'scriticisms, it is noteworthy that he participated in the Conference of Expertsconvened in late 1991 by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (theNIS-3 sponsor) specifically to refine the NIS-3 design. Together with the restof the conferees, Besharov recommended no changes in the NIS methodology anddefinitions. Now, five years later, Besharov opines that the NIS methodologyand definitions are flawed. The NIS-3 findings may run counter to his position,but it is important for Besharov and Dembosky, and for readers of Slate, to getthe facts straight.            First, when Besharov andDembosky characterized the 1.4 million additional children who joined the ranksof the maltreated between 1986 and 1993, they summed up the NIS-3 estimates ininappropriate ways to draw their conclusions. In doing so, theyoverstated the percent of children who were harmed only byemotional or educational maltreatment (actually 9 percent, not the 23 percentthey indicated) and they understated the percent of new children whowere harmed by physical abuse, sexual abuse, or physical neglect (actually 37percent, not the 22 percent they implied). Besharov and Dembosky also glossedover how these percentages translate into numbers of children. The 37 percentjust mentioned refers to over one-half million additional children whowere harmed by physical abuse, sexual abuse, or physical neglect in 1993--overand above the number who were harmed by these forms of mistreatment in 1986. Anestimated 1,249,000 children were harmed by these forms of maltreatment in1993. Also, in discounting the rise in incidence found in the NIS-3, Besharovand Dembosky contend that "fatalities arising from child abuse have heldroughly steady" between 1986 and 1993. But this is contradicted by the numbersthey themselves cite, which show that fatalities have risen by                20percent during this period, from 1,014 to 1,216.            Second, Besharov and Demboskymisrepresented the NIS methodology for classifying the severity of injury orharm. (We wish we could ascribe this to misunderstanding, but we clarified thisissue for them before their article's publication and they published theirmisinformation anyway.) In fact, the classification of a child as seriouslyinjured/harmed is relatively objective in that it does not rely on a blanketjudgment by a respondent. The criteria for defining serious harm or injury arestandardized; they are applied to the described injury itself, not to therespondent's judgment about that injury; and they have been consistent acrossthe three incidence studies. So the recent quadrupling of the number ofseriously injured children cannot be ascribed to some vague form of"definitional creep."            Third, Besharov andDembosky's claim that increased sensitivity accounts for the rise in the numberof seriously injured children does not make sense in the context of thepatterns of NIS findings, which do provide evidence of progressively heightenedsensitivity for more subtle maltreatment cues. Respondents' sensitivity tomoderate injuries increased between the NIS-1 in 1980 and the NIS-2 in 1986,but did not change after that. Between the NIS-2 and the NIS-3, respondentsshowed increased awareness of endangerment (i.e., maltreatment events that didnot yet cause harm). Note that the significant increases found in the NIS-3were discontinuous across the outcome spectrum, occurring in only twocategories: serious injury/harm and endangerment, both of which essentiallyquadrupled since the NIS-2 in 1986. If Besharov and Dembosky want to discountboth increments by appealing to the same process (enhanced sensitivity) thenthey need to explain (1) why this process applied discontinuously in the NIS-3and did not affect the intervening category of moderate injury or harm, and (2)how the NIS-2 respondents managed to overlook three-fourths of the children whohad been seriously injured while at the same time evidencing greatersensitivity in identifying moderately injured children. Seriously injuredvictims of maltreatment are relatively unlikely to escape detection by thestudy methodology, so the rise in incidence in this category cannot beplausibly explained as due to heightened awareness. Considering all theevidence, the most reasonable interpretation is that there has been a realincrease in the incidence of seriously injured children. More than one-halfmillion children were seriously injured by abuse or neglect in 1993.            Fourth, Besharov and Demboskytake issue with the documented drop of 36 percent in the rate of ChildProtective Services investigations by pointing out that the set ofuninvestigated cases includes educational neglect and emotional maltreatment.But a careful reading of their discussion reveals that they do not address thedrop per se. Instead, their entire discussion emphasizes their "take" on therelative inappropriateness of CPS investigations for emotional and educationalmaltreatment. However, educational neglect and emotional maltreatment havealways been included in the incidence studies, and eliminating them from thepicture would not eradicate the significant drop in the overall rate of CPSinvestigations from the NIS-2 to the NIS-3. In fact, the percentages ofchildren whose maltreatment was investigated decreased significantly in allcategories except educational neglect--from 64 percent to 45 percentamong physically abused children, from 75 percent to 44 percent among sexuallyabused children, from 57 percent to 35 percent among physically neglectedchildren, and from 40 percent to 26 percent among children seriously injured byany maltreatment.            Finally, contrary to whatBesharov and Dembosky convey, the NIS-3 report does not "blithely call formore" reporting. Nor did we "claim recklessly that too few cases areinvestigated." Instead, we concluded that the NIS-3 findings "emphasize theneed for better targeting, whether by reporters in referring children to CPS,by CPS screening practices in connection with reports, or by both."                           --AndreaJ.

Broadhurst, M.L.A.                                       senior researcher atWestat Inc.                                       DouglasJ. Besharov Replies:                        It is difficult to respondto Sedlak and Broadhurst's letter. First, I have great respect for their pastwork, and appreciate the constraints they faced in this project--as governmentcontractors in an underfunded study. Second, words like "misrepresented" and"misinformation" are, in the world of policy analysis, fighting words. Third,their study is complicated, and numbers can be thrown back and forth until theeyes of the average reader glaze over. Most important, my complaint is not somuch with the study as with the interpretation of its findings--and especiallywith the spin given to it by political appointees in the Department of Healthand Human Services.            Hence, I will deal with thepersonal attacks in their letter and then go on to my larger policy--andethical--concerns about their response.            In their letter, Sedlak andBroadhurst correctly point out that I participated in a 1991 Conference ofExperts that discussed the study's methodology. In fact, as director of theNational Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in the mid-1970s, I helped designthe study in the first place--long before either Sedlak or Broadhurst wereinvolved. So, I know well the strengths--and weaknesses--of the study'sapproach to the difficult task of counting illegal behaviors toward childrenthat largely occur behind closed doors.            They claim that, after the1991 meeting, I "recommended no changes in the [incidence study's] methodologyand definitions." But they conveniently leave out two important facts. First,at that meeting, I pointed out that the methodological changes that wereplanned for the study all would have the effect of raising the count ofabused and neglected children . In fact, Sedlak and her colleagues described(in a report to HHS) how they planned to "fine-tune" the study to "ensure thatcategories of key participants who were most likely to encounter suspectedmaltreatment cases in the [1986 incidence study] are given higher probabilityof being included in the [new study]." In other words, they proposed to changethe study's methodology so that more reports would be made to Westat. Second, Idid urge that the study's conclusions be modified--six months before it wasreleased to the public. On Dec. 7, 1995, Secretary Shalala issued a pressrelease stating that "the number of abused and neglected children rose sharplyfrom 1.4 million in 1986 to 2.9 million in 1993." I tried to get a copy of thereport, but was informed that no one outside the government would be given acopy until it was complete. In other words, Shalala issued her press releasebased on an uncompleted report.            Like others, I tried to getmore information about the study from Westat, but was rebuffed. In fact, Sedlaksent me a memorandum stating that "the continued contacts from your office onthe matter give the appearance of efforts to place me and my staff in acompromising position in relation to our client, NCCAN. Please ensure that yourstaff refrain from further contacts of this nature."            Concerned, I wrote toSecretary Shalala in March, stating: "The Westat findings may be extremelysignificant, but there is reason to doubt that they reflect an actual increasein abuse and neglect." I went on to explain what the problems seemed to be, andto offer my assistance in interpreting the study's results.            In a bureaucraticnonresponse, a political appointee replied by enclosing a defense of the studyprepared by Sedlak and stating, "I believe that the enclosed memo concerningthe study adequately addresses your concerns."            I mention this history,rather than dueling with Sedlak and Broadhurst's statistics, because I thinkthat it exemplifies their selective presentation of information.            The last time Sedlakconducted an incidence study, it had to be revised and reissued almost threeyears later because technical problems in the analysis inflated the estimatednumber of abused and neglected children by 11 percent.            This time around, theproblem seems to be more severe. The plain fact is that no attempt was made toconduct the kind of second-level analysis that would have explored whether theincreases were real. (The data that they cite in their letter to contradict us,by the way, were not presented in the original report and, in any event, aretoo incomplete for these purposes.) I realize that one reason this essentialwork was not performed was that the government was unwilling to pay for it. Butthat is no excuse for announcing that "child abuse and neglect nearly doubled"without also cautioning the reader about the study's limitations. I hope that,before three years pass, a revised report that does so will be issued.            Moreover, I doubt that thepeople at HHS seriously believe that child abuse doubled in seven years. If ithad, America would be in the midst of a child-abuse crisis. Decisive andperhaps radical action would be required, not the puny list of previouslyplanned and budgeted activities that Shalala described in her press release: Ademonstration program in Illinois, $23 million in prevention grants, $2.5million to maternal and child-health programs, past initiatives to fund familypreservation programs and to oppose child-welfare block grants, and an"unprecedented" level of technical assistance to the states (again, though, notan increase).            But the real reason I writeis because of the broader problem created by exaggerating social ills. Cynicsmight chalk up this latest report as yet another well-meaning effort to buildsupport for child-abuse programs. After all, goes the thinking, if the Americanpeople believe that child maltreatment is a big problem, they might be willingto spend more money on treatment and prevention programs. Richard Gelles, alongtime leader in the field and author of The Book of David: How PreservingFamilies Can Cost Children's Lives , says that he used to "go along" withpast exaggerations, but has come to appreciate the harm that they havedone.            Exaggerating the severity ofcases is what columnist Charles Krauthammer has called "defining deviancy up."The more it seems that such serious maltreatment is common, the less likely areagencies to respond firmly. To put it bluntly, society can consider a toughresponse to 150,000 serious cases a year--but 560,000 is an entirely differentmatter, politically and programmatically.            I haveworked in this field for almost 30 years--first as a young prosecutor in NewYork City, later as the director of the HHS National Center on Child Abuse andNeglect, and more recently as a trainer and consultant--and I know that childabuse and child neglect are profound national problems. But, time after time Ihave seen how such overstatements have made the problem seem too big to handleor have distorted policy-making. I am afraid that Shalala's remarks will do thesame.
