                                 Is <A NAME=            Gambling's would-befederal regulators--the National Gambling Impact Study Commission--went to LasVegas this week to hold hearings. In today'sdispatch, we learn how gambling's foes seek to demonize wagering as apernicious tobaccolike vice. In yesterday'sdispatch, gambling's foes learn the folly of having brought their anti-sincrusade to an adult Disneyland.            Tuesday's overpowering showof force by the Nevada gambling aristocracy has had at least one audible effecton the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Wednesday, even commissionChair Kay Coles James, a gambling skeptic, succumbs to the hideous Vegaseuphemism: She begins referring to the "gaming industry."            AfterTuesday's casino triumphalism, Wednesday is a comedown, eight hours of policypanels on teen gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling regulation, gamblingmarketing, and gambling credit practices. It is tough slogging, but for thefirst time I sense that this commission--though divided, underfunded, timid,and without any power beyond exhortation--isn't entirely useless. It mayfinally settle this question: Is gambling Hollywood or tobacco? Entertainmentor vice?            The sleek Vegas types, whose Strip palaces scramblecasinos, theaters, restaurants, arcades, discos, cabarets, theme parks, concerthalls, sports arenas, and museums into one giant orgy of amusement, have beenselling the idea that gambling is just entertainment--Disney in the desert.This effort has largely succeeded, because Vegas is still the dominant image ofAmerican gambling, if not the dominant reality.            The antis,meanwhile, cry that gambling is like cigarettes: unsafe for kids, viciouslyaddictive, deceptively marketed, unhealthy, expensive, and unacceptable unlessmightily regulated.            Judging by today's hearings and byconversations with most of the commissioners, the tobacco model is winning.Today's panelists tell the commission that kids are starting to gamble tooyoung and are getting addicted too easily, that compulsive gambling appears tobe increasing as gambling spreads, that gambling marketing may be designed toaddict customers, and that the industry exploits problem gamblers by allowingthem to draw repeated credit card advances from ATMs on casino floors. Thetestimony clearly impresses the commissioners and seems especially to impressthe three nonaligned commissioners who will be the swing votes on the June 1999report.            It isstarting to become clear what that report will say. The commission won't (andcan't) take any grand stand against gambling. Instead it will opt for small,targeted policies, concentrating on compulsive gambling. It will probablypropose that casinos and state lotteries fund gambling-addiction research andthat casinos take much stronger measures to bar problem gamblers from wagering.The commission may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatmentof pathological gamblers and that insurance companies be encouraged to covergambling addiction. Similarly, the commission will try to reduce gamblers'access to cash by limiting the size of ATM advances and prodding casinos toremove the machines from their floors.            The commission will also push the industry to do more toprevent kids from gambling. It will call for heavier regulation of Indiangambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gambling,perhaps by forbidding gambling companies from running online casinos. It willrebuke state lotteries for their deceptive marketing and will try to force themto post odds and stop targeting the poor. In short, it will treat gambling as atobaccolike vice.            If thecomments of the pro-industry commissioners can be believed, the industry willhappily endorse such a report. Gamblers don't quite accept the cigaretteanalogy--though commission member Bill Bible, a former chief of the NevadaGaming Commission, did concede that gambling was like alcohol--but they'rehappy to sign on to the specific measures. The casino industry is even tryingto get ahead of the commission. It has already established a (mostly)independent center to fund research into pathological gambling. I suspect thatthe industry will not only agree to the commission's recommendations but willbecome their strongest advocate. Casino owners will avidly lobby Congress andstate legislatures to enact the recommendations into law.            Why should the pro-gamblers cooperate with acritical study? Because it provides superb cover for them. It medicalizes theproblem of compulsive gambling, blaming it on psychological abnormality ratherthan industry machination. Likewise, cracking down on compulsives is alsopolitically cost-effective. In exchange for losing a few compulsive gamblers,the casinos will (falsely) appear more concerned with the health of theircustomers than with profits.            Thecigarette agenda will also distract the commission and the public from the truereasons for worry. A few years ago, gambling was confined to Las Vegas andAtlantic City. It is now thriving in 48 states, and there is no sign thatanyone can stop it. In this election, gambling interests dropped $100 millionon a single California ballot initiative, toppled governors in twostates, and bought senators and representatives by the crate. What thecommission ought to be investigating is whether the gambling industry hasbecome so powerful that it's politically untouchable. But it can't, because thegambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable.            The antis can call gambling "tobacco." They can call it"vice." They can call it "a big red balloon" for all that the industry cares.As long as the commission just nibbles around the edges, the casino operatorsand state lotteries will be happy to indulge it. The pro-gambling folks willwin credit for cooperating, without having to do anything that really hurts.The last national gambling commission was in the mid-1970s. If the gamblersplay along with this commission's timid recommendations, they'll be safe foranother 20 years.                           AnApology                        I owe anapology to Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, whom I criticized yesterday for using theterm "Indian country" during a speech critical of Indian casinos. As severalreaders pointed out to me, "Indian country" is a common phrase in the West andhas no derogatory connotations. I'm sorry, Senator.            Talk about quick defeats:The first sign I see outside the MGM Grand ballroom all but declares that theNational Gambling Impact Study Commission has already lost. The sign reads:"National Gaming Impact Study Commission."                           "Gaming"?                        In LasVegas, the euphemizers reign. Once upon a time, the casino owners decided that"gambling" was too crude, too avaricious, to describe their fair business. So"gambling" disappeared in Las Vegas, and "gaming" has risen in its place. Hewho controls language controls ideas, and at today's commission hearing, it isperfectly clear who controls the language. Video slot machines crammed intoconvenience stores--perhaps the most pernicious form of legal gambling thereis--are called "retail gaming." People who own casinos are not "casino owners,"they are "gaming visionaries." Pathological gamblers are "problem gamers"--asif they're having trouble mastering the rules of Monopoly. And the NationalGambling Impact Study Commission is reborn as the National Gaming Impact StudyCommission.            The gambling industry did everything in its power to stopthe establishment of this commission two years ago, but Congress and a ferventgrassroots anti-gambling group eventually foisted it on the industry. The ninemember blue-ribbon panel was charged with assessing the social and economicimpact of gambling, and it will issue a final report to Congress and thepresident in June 1999. Even though the panel was carefully balanced betweenpro- and anti-gambling leaders, it was supposed to be Vegas' nemesis. Theindustry and Las Vegas' pro-gambling media quaked in anticipation of theonerous regulations and taxes the commission might recommend.            But they quake no more.Whatever national momentum the anti-gamblers had dissolved in last week'selections. The industry routed opponents in state after state. Missouri voterspassed a ballot initiative to allow boat casinos. Californians voted to expandIndian casinos. In South Carolina and Alabama, voters expelled anti-lottery,anti-gambling Republican governors and replaced them with pro-lotteryDemocrats. The gambling industry spent more than $100 million on politicalcontributions and issue ads. It has never been fatter, happier, or moresecure.            "Mygoodness, no politician can withstand their resources," Focus on the Family'sJames Dobson, the commission's leading gambling opponent, tells me. Theindustry's political clout has emasculated the commission, Dobson continues:"Our report won't be acted on by the president or Congress. They are tooheavily influenced by gambling money. Almost all the leaders of Congress are onthe dole." It has also become obvious that the commission has too manypro-gambling members to produce a report that recommends taxes or other realpenalties on the industry.            So the commission's two day visit to Gomorrahhas been transformed from a charged political event to a kind of victory lapfor gaming. Nevada Gov. Bob Miller and the "gaming visionaries" have beenplanning for these hearings for months, hoping to use them to demonstrate themight and sanctity and goodness of the Nevada gambling industry.            The MGMGrand, which is run by commission member Terrence Lanni, is itself the firstexhibit of the Vegas triumphalists. It is gaudy testimony that consumers, atleast, have no problem with this business. The MGM Grand, a k a "The City ofEntertainment," has 5,000 rooms--the corridor outside my room is 200 yardslong, so long I can't see its end--to feed the endless supply of slot machines,craps tables, and roulette wheels. David Cassidy performs here everynight--twice! A few steps outside on the Strip is still more overwhelmingevidence that Las Vegas has won the popular vote. New York, New York is justacross the street, the $1.6 billion Bellagio is one door down, and a half-scaleEiffel Tower is going up next door. The setting has, as the pro-gambling folksno doubt hoped, stunned some of the gambling opponents. I asked oneanti-gambling activist who had never before been to Vegas what she thinks ofit. She could only blurt out "Wow."            The hearings, too, reinforce the Glorious Las Vegas theme.Frank Fahrenkopf, the industry's top lobbyist (who is paid so much he canafford monogrammed shirt cuffs --I saw them), holds forth cheerfullyoutside the ballroom, celebrating the electoral triumph of freedom overreligious moralist tyranny. Inside, the room is packed with more than 600people in neon lime green T-shirts that read "Unions and Gaming: Together for aBetter Life." They are members of the major casino union, here to cheer ontheir employers and their union. (Most of them, it must be said, are gettingpaid to do this.)            ChairwomanKay Coles James, a Christian conservative and skeptic of gambling, opens thehearing by assuring the crowd that the committee is toothless: "We're not hereto take anyone's job. ... We have no power to do anything except makerecommendations." This sets the mood for most of the day: Vegas is great, soyou'd better leave it alone! The local government, by all appearances a whollyowned subsidiary of the casinos, puts on a bravura performance. Gov. Milleropens the show with a 15 minute hymn to Las Vegas. It is the first of manystatistical barrages about Nevada's one-ders: No. 1 in job growth, No. 1 inpopulation growth, and No. 1 on planet Earth in per capita Girl Scouttroops--and Boy Scout troops!            Later in the day, Nevada's senators and bothits congressmen appear to chew out the commission for even thinking that Nevadamight have a dark side. They pay tribute to Nevada's sophisticated gamblingindustry, especially its regulation (much stricter than other gambling states)and its use of gambling taxes to fund state services. It is one of the ironiesof Nevada politics that its Republican congressmen (Jim Gibbons and JohnEnsign) end up crediting their state's success to government regulation andcorporate taxation.            There arealso a fair share of gleeful gambling regulators, bookmakers, and casinoemployees among the panels of expert witnesses the commission hears from.Critics who gripe about the perils of sports gambling and the evils ofconvenience store slot machines leaven the pro-gambling folks. Everyone,including the gambling industry shills, agrees that Internet gambling is eviland should be destroyed. Everyone agrees to this because no one in Las Vegas ismaking any money off Internet gambling. If they were, you can be sure theywould explain why it's as American as nickel slots and scratch-off games.            Pro-Vegas forces are also perfectly happy to take shots atIndian gambling, the chief economic threat to Nevada's prosperity. Theexpansion of Indian casinos resulting from last week's California voterinitiative will slam Las Vegas, cutting its gambling revenues by $400 million ayear. So the Vegans repeatedly swing at casinos in "Indian country" (that'sNevada Sen. Richard Bryan's term--I'm not joking) for being insufficientlyregulated and taxed. One tribal chief I spoke to calls this "red baiting."            (Pause for an aestheticobservation: I am sitting right behind the witnesses, and after a while I beginto separate them into the Wides and the Narrows. The Wides are men in suitswith enormous backs and enormous bellies, men who eat and eat and used to playfootball. They all testify to their love of gambling. The Narrows are thin andgenerally disapprove of it. I begin to wonder whether fondness for gamblingcorrelates with general indulgence, and dislike correlates with asceticism, anddecide that they probably do.)            During thelast hour of the day, the public comment period, the union sends a parade ofcasino employees to the microphone to hallelujah the gaming industry.Housekeepers, cooks, and slot change girls, almost all black or Latina, tellthe same story: I was working a dead-end job in another state, "then I heardabout Las Vegas, where there's opportunity!" I moved here, landed a job at aunion casino with high pay, free medical insurance, a pension, and "now I ambuying a house." The stories are intensely moving, by far the most persuasivetribute to the Strip that I've ever heard.            Still, for all the Vegan triumphalism in theair, it's impossible not to be charmed by the chief gambling opponent, the Rev.Tom Grey. Grey is utterly irrepressible. A Vietnam rifleman turned Methodistminister, Grey has spent the last eight years evangelizing against gambling. Hefounded the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, the primary forcebehind the commission's creation. (Grey, in a rare acknowledgement of defeat,has just renamed it the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, tacitlyrecognizing that gambling is here to stay.) He is a genial motormouth andshameless promoter of the cause. He wears a gigantic "CasiNO" button in thecasino. He posed for People in a shepherd's robe. He says "I would doanything short of lighting myself on fire in the Capitol rotunda to stopgambling." He is so excitable that I have to yank him out of the way of anoncoming car when he gets too wrapped up in one of his soliloquies.            He and his Las Vegas allies,a former Las Vegas city councilman named Steve Miller and an inner city venturecapitalist named Otis Harris, invite me on a tour of Las Vegas. "Behind theMirage," they call it. For two hours, we cruise the streets behind the casinos.They show me all the evidence of gambling blight you'd never want to see, froma youth-center-turned-crack-house to pawn shops to sex shops to down at heelscasinos to quickie motels. All the while, they keep up a patter about howterrible a neighbor the casino industry is and how superficial Las Vegas'prosperity is.            It's verygrim and mostly persuasive. Still, when we turn back on to the Strip, and passthe jaw-dropping Stratosphere and Circus Circus and Bellagio and the MGMGrand--a 30 story tower bathed in fabulous emerald light, I realize why Grey'stask is hopeless here. He is committing the cardinal sin of Vegas. All he wantsto do is talk about losers. In Las Vegas, under the thrilling lights of theStrip, no one wants to hear about losers. In the land of gaming, notgambling, everyone is sure he's a winner.
