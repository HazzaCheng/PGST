LightenUp on Linda                        In her July 6 entry in thedialogue "Linda Tripp: Victimized or Vicious," Margaret Carlson writes,concerning Linda Tripp, "I have to stick by my observation that people, forbetter or for worse, grow into their appearance, coming to look on the outsideas they feel on the inside."            Imagineif Rush Limbaugh said something like that regarding, say, Hillary?            -- Jim Howard                                       TrippTrapped                        It seemsthat most people view Linda Tripp (Linda Tripp: Victimized or Vicious) as some kind of wickedstepmother, and that is unfortunate. Tripp is justified in worrying that herjob and reputation were being threatened after Clinton's lawyer identified heras someone who is "not to be believed." It would be very easy for me to say,piously, that I would have sacrificed my job rather than make the recordings,but I am a single 24-year-old without children, and I can afford to take a moreprincipled stance. Tripp has not only herself to think about when it comes toprotecting her job and reputation, but also the well-being of her children andher ability to support them. What would people think of a mother who sacrificedher own children in order to protect the president and Monica?            -- Damian M.Schloming                                       Tapingfor Trouble                        Please ask Jonah Goldberg(Linda Tripp:Victimized or Vicious) to explain why he thinks, if all Tripp wanted to dowas to protect her good name, she continued to tape Lewinsky long after shewould have had enough "evidence" for this purpose. As Carlson says, "A 'seekerof the truth,' as Tripp refers to herself, might at best need to tape oneconversation and hold it in reserve for that dark moment when her veracity waschallenged. Instead, she taped 20 hours' worth and offered them upgratuitously, to get the ball, which wasn't moving much, rolling."            Why,Jonah?            -- AngusMaitland                                       Yates?Yikes!                        As one of the constituents ofSidney Yates, the topic of Jacob Weisberg's July 2 "StrangeBedfellow," I can tell you that he has been a distant and ineffectivecongressman for decades. I say this despite the fact that I agree with Yates onmost political issues. Not surprisingly, Weisberg admits his personalrelationships with Yates and his staff.            Yates has done little for theeconomic development of our district. While I admire his championship of thearts and the environment, these do little concrete for the vast majority ofconstituents. Yates is the only congressman in the Illinois delegation whorefuses to set up an e-mail link for constituents. How does this sit with aMicrosoft enterprise? Yates refused to step aside when he became obviouslyphysically infirm. He misses more votes than all but a handful ofcongressmen.            Yates maintains littlecontact with his district and made only token campaign appearances. He refusedto debate his campaign opponents. Emperor Sid treated those Democrats who daredto oppose him as traitors and thought of himself as congressman by divineright.            Our district will now bevastly better off by his replacement by a person 45 years his junior. Yates haspersonally enriched himself at the expense of his constituents and hisretirement is welcome to many.            Ironically, one of the biggest news splashes made by Yates in the last decadewas when one of his staffers invoked Sid's clout and attempted to set updog-walking runs in Rock Creek Park. When this hit the newspapers, out-of-touchSid denied any knowledge of the aide's activities. What an embarrassment.            -- Thomas A.Marshall                                       Phenomenology of Spirits                        As a member of thatclandestine group of German wine lovers that Fareed Zakaria describes in hisJune 30 "Wine's World," I feel obliged to clarify the place in the pantheonof winedom of one of the figures mentioned in Zakaria's hymn.            I speak, of course, ofHegel. Whatever the merits of the rather severe idiom in which Hegel chose tocouch his ideas, he was nonetheless a member in good standing in the winelovers' circle. He grew up in a wine drinking area (Wrttemberg), and he did astint as a house tutor at Frankfurt's most distinguished wine merchant. Infact, in an effort to lure him into taking the job, his friend Hlderlin evenpromised him, "you will drink very good Rhine wine or French wine at thetable." When he was writing his Phenomenology of Spirit, despite his verymeager income at the time, he was ordering shipments of Mdoc and Pontak(Haut-Brion). (See where his priorities lay.) When he became famous in Berlin,his tastes shifted slightly to Mosels (loved them), Rhine wines, and Cahors(lots of it). He especially loved the 1811 vintage of "comet" wines, and he andSchleiermacher even stopped quarreling for a while after Schleiermacher gaveHegel the address of a good Bordeaux merchant!            Worldlyin his heart, he was also not averse to the Italians, drinking and praising"Lacrima Christi" (red) as he was writing a Latin oration on the AugsburgConfession. When he was visiting Saxon Dresden at the height of the Prussianreaction in the 1820s, he surprised his students sitting at the table with himby ordering the most expensive champagne in Europe, Chteau Sillery. With noneof the students quite understanding just what called for such a lavish outlayon the old fellow's part, he astonished them even more by raising his glass andtoasting July 14 and the storming of the Bastille. So on July 14, instead ofchampagne, a crisp Riesling might be the way for us German wine lovers to toastthat venerated French holiday. We can celebrate Hegel and the revolution at thesame time. And indulge our secret taste.            -- TerryPinkard Professor of philosophyGeorgetown UniversityWashington                           BedrockBlues                        As much as I enjoy ScottShuger's daily analysis of "Today's Papers," from time to time he gets thefacts just plain wrong. Usually it's in the last paragraph, and it's usuallysome flippant remark that would be witty if it were only true.            In theJuly 2 Today's Papers, Shuger wrote:                        [Clinton] told familiesthere that home ownership is an investment in society, the bedrock ofmiddle-class life. Wonder if the Times had trouble resisting theobservation that it's an investment Clinton's never made, a bedrock he's neverstood on.            I quotefrom Page 151 of Meredith Oakley's biography On the Make: The Rise of BillClinton :            Hillary, three months shyof her twenty-eighth birthday, returned to Fayetteville ... inclined to acceptthe twenty-nine-year-old Clinton's marriage proposal. Any remaining reluctancewas dashed when he greeted her return with the news that he had purchased asmall brick and stonework house she had admired.            Thisoft-reported account of Clinton's marriage proposal is well known. Too badShuger felt the need to be witty--but wrong. Guess he was just followingClinton's Fifth Law of Politics (Page 146)--"Under enough pressure, mostpeople--but not everybody--will stretch the truth on you."            -- KariChisholm Portland, Ore.                           TheDelicate Art of Profanity                        I was just reading thisfascinating and well-written article ("Flame Posies,"July 3) about the New York Times and the Washington Post andadmiring the balls of a publication that ran the headline "Who gives a f***about the yen?" last week and had already used the phrase "holy shit" upward offive times in the opening paragraphs, when I happened upon this sentence:"Later that year, the paper spread its legs for the theory that TWA Flight 800was downed by foul play, based on the discovery of 'PETN' residues in thewreckage."            I am, personally, a big fanof the well-chosen off-color remark. "Screw you," "kiss my ass," "fuckme"--these are all phrases that have levels of meaning that have nothing to dowith the physical acts they describe. (See Donnie Brasco and"fuggedaboudit.") I have recently deliberately begun to use variations of "kickass" and "bites X in the ass" because they are colorful, evocative phrases;because, thanks to South Park , ass references are newly familiar andhilarious and because they don't evoke particularly vivid mental images ofasses any longer. Or at least, less than they used to.            What I am very gently tryingto get at is: I don't think the phrase "spread its legs" has quite entered theoff-color oversoul. I think, like "up the ass," it is just a smidgen too vividfor the average reader. (Then again, we have seen the rise of "suck" in itsmany forms, so perhaps I'll be proved wrong.) So when you write "spreads itslegs," that's exactly what I think of, and for me, there is somethinginherently unpleasant in having my gender's chief sexual activity thrown up onthe electronic page as an analogy for submissiveness. Human reproduction prettymuch hinges on leg-spreading and, hence, one would think this act would besynonymous with ... well, something better than the Times beingsluttishly seduced into an ill-supported TWA theory.            Bottomline: You don't have so much as a Saturday Night Live sketch to point toas an example of how the phrase "spread its legs" has become so prevalent as tohave mostly lost its primary meaning; I think sex deserves better than to becompared to bad reporting and I'm not especially keen on seeing my gender'srole during sex interpreted as one of whorish submission.            -- Kate Powers                                       SchoolPrinciples                        David Brooks chides BillMcKibben in the July 1 "Breakfast Table" for having one child, arguing that it is "symbolicpolitics taken to an extreme." If only one couple does it, it will have littleeffect on the situation. "Maybe if everybody followed McKibben's lead it would[make a difference]." In the next paragraph, he says it's OK for Bill andHillary Clinton to send their kid to a private school while opposing schoolchoice because you should be able to rise above principle to send your kids toprivate school.            Am I the only one who noticesthe faulty logic? The problem is that the Clintons aren't an isolated example.Many of the opponents of school choice send their kids to private school, evenwhile professing steadfast belief in public schools. This is like McKibbenhaving 10 children, making his wife/significant other take fertility drugs, andthen telling everyone we are running out of resources and everyoneelse should have one child.            If therewere only one white, affluent couple sending its child to private schools whiledecrying school choice for others, that would be one thing. For an entirepolitical class to engage in this behavior is a national disaster. Perhaps thatis why (as Brooks says) public schools are crappy in three-fourths of thecountry.            -- BillJones Pasadena, Calif.                           The AFICannon                        I followed Charles PaulFreund's argument in the July 1 "High Concept" about the AFI 100 greatest films list and thedecline of cultural gatekeeping right up to the point when he began discussingthe actual movies on the list. But his offhand comment that Bonnie andClyde "presents criminality in soft focus" is so off-the-beam it taints hisentire analysis. Exactly what is "soft focus" about the bank teller who getsshot full in the face or Gene Hackman's agonizing death throes or Bonnie andClyde 's final, staccato "dance of death"?            Freund's take on theGodfather pictures as a "daydream of limitless wealth and power" is evenloonier. Has he even seen The Godfather Part II , which charts thecomplete moral decay of Pacino's Michael in minute psychological detail? Freundis right that in many ways the Godfather pictures (especially PartII ) are the opposite of the traditional gangster movie, but he's preciselywrong in his reasons why. In fact, it's the older gangster pictures thatromanticize the charismatic crooks portrayed by Bogart, Cagney, Robinson, etal. There's nothing romantic about the criminal violence depicted in theGodfather movies or the way the blood seems to drain out of Pacino'scharacter over the course of the epic.            Given thevolumes that have been written about these movies, Freund's blatant misreadingsare stupefying. Maybe a little more cultural gatekeeping on the part of                  Slate                editors is in order.            -- SteveWarrick Pleasant Hill, Calif.                           The Dirton White Boards                        Regarding the June 29"Millionerds" column on white boards, Michael Lewis writes,"But I have now seen many hundreds of these boards, bearing the remnants ofsome recent group meeting, and I cannot recall ever seeing anything on themremotely resembling a thought."            Have you now? Have you everbeen part of a team developing a OO plan for a software project? Have you everdiagramed a relational database for a critique from your colleagues? Most ofthe white boards you've seen were spied while you were escorted about by PRflacks or techs and suits on a PR mission. They were all sort of nervousbecause you're a celebrity writer. They gave you free meals. Am I right sofar?            You'venever seen a white board used in real technical development, have you? Youdon't really know what you're talking about, do you? The fact that what you'vejust written--and much of what you've written before--is untrue doesn't botheryou because it's all in fun, right? And not really important, true? Just toamuse, you see.

Regarding Michael Lewis'comments in "Millionerds" about programmers' use of "so": It's aCalifornia programmer thing, not a programmer thing. I work inChampaign-Urbana, Ill., (about 150 miles south of Chicago, 120 miles west ofIndianapolis, home of the University of Illinois) and no professionalprogrammer I know has this verbal mannerism.            Mypersonal opinion would be that people give so many technical presentations informal and informal settings, where every other sentence or clause starts with"so"--"so then the frob bit is set, so this path is followed, so no data hitsthe wire"--that they just "get in the habit" of prefacing everything with"so."            -- Alan M.Carroll Cisco Systems                           WorkingWords                        Although Jason Turner'sremark, discussed in the June 29 "Chatterbox," may have been unintentional in its reference to the"welcome sign" over Auschwitz's main gate, his attitude remains the same:forced labor without hope for education, decent child care, or a better future.I'm not Jewish or German, but I immediately recognized the infamous quote.
