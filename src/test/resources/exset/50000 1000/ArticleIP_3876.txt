DevilFish                        In response to Daniel Akst'spiece "PassiveAggressive": Here at Morningstar we spend most of our days thinking about investmentstrategies, and rarely does the word "evil" come to mind. Of course, there isvice in the mutual-fund business. Fund companies' greed-inspired pursuit ofassets occasionally leads them to lie, cheat, and virtually steal from theirshareholders, through deceptive advertising or outrageous fees and expenses.But index funds rarely commit such sins--they are surely the choirboys of theindustry.            Thus, I was surprised to seeindex funds tarred as "evil" in your article. You allege that greedy index-fundinvestors take advantage of noble souls doing their own research and therebythreaten to erode the quality of information and research that is thefoundation of our efficient stock markets. In fact, this view is almostcompletely opposite to the truth. The rise of index funds should be seen astriumphant proof that our financial markets are robustly efficient. And it willbe impossible for index funds to destroy the efficiency of markets as long asthose markets remain free and ruled by greed.            You beguile us with theimage of a pastoral commons in which index investors are selfish free ridersgrazing on the fruits of hard-working financial analysts. Having talked tohundreds of mutual fund managers, I'd suggest that this is not the appropriatevision of the workings of the stock market. Instead, imagine a huge ocean ofinformation populated by vicious, hungry sharks. These sharks patrol the waterslooking for juicy tidbits to grow fat on. After they have had their fill of theprey, its carcass falls to the bottom of the sea. There bottom feeders waitpatiently to scavenge the remaining scraps. They don't get fat, but they have anice, easy life waiting for their dinner to fall to them. In this metaphor, thesharks are the active investors, and the indexers are the bottom feeders. Thefinal crucial detail that ensures that this world and our financial marketswill always function smoothly is that the sharks can become bottom feeders, andvice versa.            If this were a truebiological world, competition between the species and the drive for survivalwould ensure that there is equilibrium between the sharks and the bottomfeeders. If the lazy bottom feeders become too numerous, there won't be enoughcarcasses floating down to the bottom. In this case, the ill-fed bottom feederswill decide to join the sharks, and will hunt their own kills. In the alternatecase, when sharks swarm the waters, there will be little reward to theirhunting, and some of the sharks will retire to the easy life of bottomfeeding.            There isa similar equilibrium in the financial world. Only, in the stock market, theequilibrating force is unfettered greed. Today, aided by an explosion ininformation technology, there are thousands and thousands of active, aggressiveinvestors pouncing on every nugget of information, thereby making the marketshighly efficient. In this world, it makes eminent sense for some investors togive up the hunt and be satisfied with the quiet life of indexing. It is truethat the indexers are free-riding on the sharks. But don't cry for thesharks--they are just as selfish as the bottom feeders. The sharks are free tohang up their fins any time and pursue the lazy life. And they surely will,whenever it pays to do so. As the profits from active investing diminish, therewill automatically be fewer active investors and more indexers. And wheneverthe profits from an active strategy become evident, a feeding frenzy of sharkswill appear. It is this freedom that investors have--to follow any strategy,from fundamental analysis to astrology--combined with the powerful drive ofhuman greed, that guarantees that our financial markets will always be highlyefficient, and that indexing or any other investing strategy will never pose athreat to market efficiency. As long as at least a few sharks patrol thewaters, we will all be safe.                           --Todd Porter mutualfund analyst, Morningstar                           Akst MeNo Questions                        Although his criticisms in"PassiveAggressive" are right on the mark, Daniel Akst need have no fear of thefree-riding index investors who strive for mediocrity by investing passively.If 20 percent of new mutual fund money is now going into indexed funds, asopposed to 3 percent in 1994, we can have some confidence that the indexers areplanting the seeds of their own destruction. As more people drop out of thecompetition to outperform, the marginal research and trading value of thedecreasing number of active investors will become significant, and they willbegin to beat the market.            Take the argument for passiveinvesting to its extreme: Suppose that tomorrow morning all funds were investedsolely in index funds. By definition, that would be the last trade in the stockmarket. That is, no one would be able to react to new information. Clearly,some investors would break from the pack as new information became public andothers were not reacting. Thus, the number of passive vs. active investors willalways fluctuate around an equilibrium.            By theway, the "tragedy of the commons" is not a theoretical construct from a 1960senvironmentalist. It was coined almost 200 years ago (I think perhaps by DavidRicardo), to describe the pre-industrial land-tenure system in Britain, whereinpeasants would destructively graze their livestock on commonly held land.Furthermore, the traditional response to the observation is not in favor of"greens, social critics, and other worrywarts who fret over issues such aspopulation growth," but rather supports the capitalist argument that land tendsto be used more efficiently under private ownership, in that the owner isinterested in supporting the long-term value of the property.                           --John RobertsonGraham Vancouver, B.C.                           TheWicked Niche of the East                        Paul Krugman's July 17column, "The East Isin the Red," uses superficial research and ad hominem attacks to criticizea recent article of mine on U.S. trade with emerging economies like China.Rather than join Krugman in the gutter, I will deal with his few substantivepoints.            First, Krugman belittlesconcerns about America's huge and growing merchandise trade deficits with Chinabecause the U.S. government figures I cited have kept Hong Kong and thePeople's Republic of China separate. Combine them, he claims, and China's bigglobal merchandise trade surplus shrinks to insignificance.            What Krugman does notexplain is how, if the macroeconomic forces he emphasizes truly explain China'strade flows, the PRC can be growing at roughly double-digit rates and running aglobal surplus. In fact, at one point he insists that it is an "arithmeticalnecessity" for big capital importers like China to run trade deficits.Evidently the Politburo at MIT needs some math lessons.            Further, China's tradebalance with the United States was my focus, not China's global balance. Andfor 1996, combining the Hong Kong and China figures reduced America's Chinadeficit only from $39 billion to $35 billion.            Moreover, the annual exportfigures for the PRC are considered by the U.S. government to be understated byat least $6 billion--the amount of Chinese textiles and apparel fraudulentlyshipped to the United States through third countries. Industry estimates placethe figure at some $10 billion. But of course, what could matters like customsfraud possibly have to do with trade policy?            Krugman also criticizes myexpectation that emerging economies will continue developing as world-classexporters but remain small consumer goods markets. After all, he argues,although countries that produce more than they consume must run tradesurpluses, these surpluses will guarantee high consumption because theresulting national income increase "has to show up somewhere ." Moreover,he observes, most emerging economies are running global trade deficits--i.e.,consuming even more than they produce--precisely because they importconsiderable foreign capital.            Yet many countries becomemajor importers but not major consumer markets. How? By concentrating theirimports in capital goods, intermediate goods, and industrial inputs--the veryproducts needed to maintain export-led growth. Such growth may indeed one daycreate big consumer markets. But "one day" may be a long time coming.            For governments in thesecountries have aims other than enriching domestic consumers. Indeed, many denyindividuals and businesses broad freedom to consume precisely because their toppriority is building national economic power--especially productivecapacity--over the long haul. As the examples of Japan and South Korea show,for strategic reasons they are willing to interfere with Krugman's vauntedmarket-equilibrating forces for decades, by mandating high savings andsuppressing domestic consumption in other ways, and pushing exports. And whenthey do consume, they often focus on purchases whose economic benefits do nottrickle down or abroad--like weapons. Indeed, most of east and southeast Asiais in the midst of a big, prolonged military buildup.            Finally, numerous statisticsbelie Krugman's claim that real wages inevitably rise with productivity. That'scertainly not the case in the United States. Nor is it the case in Mexico.There, manufacturing productivity rose by an annual average of 6.6 percentbetween 1988 and 1993 (the Salinas years). But just before the 1994 pesocollapse, real hourly wages stood nearly 30 percent below 1990 levels. One mainreason: Some 1 million Mexicans enter the country's workforce every year,greatly increasing the labor surplus in a land where unemployment andunderemployment were estimated by the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City at a stunning35 percent in late 1995.            Indeed, labor surpluses andfalling wages plague most low-income countries outside east Asia. And eventhere, anecdotal evidence indicates that once labor costs take off, so doesforeign investment--for much-lower-wage, labor-rich countries like China.            Finally, Krugman's numberson Asian wages catching up to U.S. wages ignore one big factor contributing tothat narrowing: a decline in U.S. wages. Although he calls this trendPanglossian, few other Americans will.            Ianxiously await the bucket of mud Krugman is undoubtedly preparing to sling inresponse.            -- Alan Tonelson U.S.Business and Industrial Council Educational Foundation                           PaulKrugman replies: I'm sorry that Alan Tonelson's offended dignity hasprevented him from actually taking on board the substantive arguments that Imade in my article. Let me try, however, to make four points:            1) Tonelson seems to thinkthat the proposition that a country which attracts large capital inflows mustalso be running a trade deficit is merely my opinion. It isn't: It is a matterof sheer accounting--it is, exactly as I said, an "arithmetical necessity." AndI believe that whatever asperity I may have shown in the column is justified bythe astonishing fact that he really doesn't understand that.            The point--which I thought Imade clearly in the column, but then what do I know?--is that China's tradesurplus, and actual rough balance on current account, shows that the country isnot, in fact, a net recipient of capital. (Capital account plus current accountequals zero; that is a fact, not a theory, whatever the Politburo may say.) Anyattempt to make sense of the country's trade must include an explanation of howthe money brought in by foreign investors goes out again.            2) Tonelson accuses me of"superficial research," then says that in his article, "China's trade balancewith the United States was my focus, not China's global balance." I have nowdone a little more research, by rereading his review of Jeffrey Garten's TheBig Ten , which was clearly cited as the source of my quotations ( NewYork Times Book Review , June 15, Page 30). If there is any mention ofChina's trade balance with the United States in there, I can't find it--infact, the article seems to say quite clearly that emerging economies will notoffer large markets to anyone. Maybe Tonelson has some other article inmind?            Doing a bit more research, Idiscover that in my own column I included a long sidebar which acknowledgedthat, while the precise numbers are in dispute, China certainly does run alarge bilateral surplus vis--vis the United States, and tried to discuss theeconomic meaning of that surplus. But maybe Tonelson had stopped reading bythen.            3) Tonelson's letter makes abig point of the likelihood that advanced countries will export mainly capitalequipment rather than consumer goods to the emerging economies. Why, exactly,is this a problem? Is selling tractors and forklifts somehow a less soundbusiness than selling soft drinks? (What fools the Japanese are, selling us allthose numerically controlled machine tools.) As the saying goes, "Give a man afish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you can sell himequipment."            4) Finally, Tonelson deniesthat productivity increases lead to higher wages, insisting that the dramaticconvergence in hourly compensation between the United States and the Asiantigers has been achieved through a fall in the U.S. level. Funny: When I checkout the "real hourly compensation" number in the back of the 1997 EconomicReport of the President (Page 354), a book which I assume Tonelson has onhis desk, I find that it went up about 8 percent between 1975 and 1995.We could go on at length about whether workers should have received even more,or what adjustments one might make to that number to move it down (or up) abit, but by any calculation I can make, the overwhelming picture is one ofconvergence between wages in the tigers and in the West through a process ofleveling up, not leveling down.            I shouldperhaps say that I have nothing personal against Alan Tonelson. I quoted himonly because I often find it hard to convince people that the views of thefaction he represents are as crude and naive as they really are. "Surely,"people say, "they can't really believe that countries can attract massivecapital inflows and run big trade surpluses at the same time? They must havesome more sophisticated point in mind." The only answer to suchrationalizations is to catch somebody with his hand in the cookie jar. Andwhatever Tonelson may say, I caught him red-handed.                           The Rapeof the Lockheed                        In JamesSurowiecki's article "The Lockheed Redemption," he stated that Lockheed was"currently building the F-117A Stealth fighter and the thoroughly unnecessaryF-22 for the Air Force." Given that the skies are filling up with planes likethe Eurofighter, the Dassault Rafale, the J-10, the JAS Gripen, the MiG-29 and35, and the Sukoi Su-27 and 35, all of which are comparable or superior to anyU.S. fighter, how can the F-22 be "thoroughly unnecessary"? Those other planesare being built by countries which are all pushing hard for foreign sales, soit is not inconceivable that our Air Force might confront some of thesehigh-tech planes in the future. The question is, will they do it with adecades-old plane designed to fight the battles of the past, or one designed tofight the battles of the future?            -- BrianShibayama                                       Don'tShoot the Messinger                        In James Traub's "New York's LoneliestLiberal," he says: "By the time David Dinkins became mayor in 1989, thiskind of spending had made New York ungovernable. The economy was dead, thebudget was in perpetual crisis, and crime was shooting through the roof.Dinkins did nothing to reverse the trend."            This isan incredibly ignorant statement. Crime went down the last three of Dinkins'four years, and much of the current drop in crime can be attributed to thethousands of extra police that Dinkins fought for in Albany. Dinkins balancedthe budget all four years, something that Giuliani has not been able toaccomplish. The current economic turnaround started in 1993, Dinkins' finalyear in office.            -- David White NewYork City                           A Shot inthe Arm                        Funny theplaces you find vindication. Steven E. Landsburg seems to be saying in"Property IsTheft" that if an anti-theft device benefits citizens other than theproperty owner, it should be encouraged. Research indicates that liberal("shall-issue" concealed carry gun permit laws, not left-wing ideology)firearms laws result in a reduction of crimes against persons. Since citizenslegally carrying firearms make those areas safer, firearms restrictions arecounterproductive. Thank you for the encouragement.            -- FredNiziol Columbia, Md.                           Steven E.Landsburg replies: Fred Niziol is correct in his facts but mistaken in hisreasoning. Recent research does indicate that liberal firearms lawsreduce crime against persons. But it does not follow that liberal firearms lawsreduce crime against persons who do not carry firearms . Therein lies acritical distinction.            Consider three hypotheses:Hypothesis 1 says that when I buy a gun, I discourage people from becomingcriminals and so reduce crime against my neighbors. In that case, according tothe cost-benefit criterion that economists like to employ, my gun ownershipshould be subsidized.            Hypothesis 2 says that when Ibuy a gun, I prevent crimes against myself while having no effect on crimesagainst my neighbors; criminals who choose me as a victim end up wasting theirtime, but criminals who choose you as a victim are as successful asever. In that case, I have ample incentive to arm myself, and there is noreason to encourage me with a subsidy.            Hypothesis 3 says that when Ibuy a $100 gun, I protect myself from, say, $150 worth of property loss, whileinflicting, say, $75 worth of property loss on my neighbors--because half thecriminals who try unsuccessfully to rob me go on to rob someone else instead.In that case--again, according to the usual cost-benefit criterion--my gun is abad thing; it costs $100 and only reduces total crime by $75. That's anargument for discouraging gun ownership through taxation.            I do not know which of thesehypotheses is closest to the truth and am not aware of any research thatsettles that question. Therefore I do not know whether gun ownership should besubsidized, taxed, or neither.            What'sremarkable about the Lojack research is that it does do a careful job ofdistinguishing among the analogues of Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3. That takes a lotof hard work and ingenuity. It will take harder work and more ingenuity beforewe know whether Niziol has jumped to the right or the wrong conclusion.                           BrissingLink                        I found"So Arethe Neanderthals Still Jews?" by Charles Paul Freund to be inappropriatefor a publication from Microsoft. While it may be that Freund was attemptingsatire in his review of anti-Semitic origins over the last 2,000 years, it isjust a stonestep away from believing that Freund himself believes many of thethings he chronicles. More importantly, his writing style lends credence tothese blatantly racist and anti-Semitic writings. What purpose or higherreasoning can Microsoft use to justify such writing?                           --Adam Goldstein,M.D. Chapel Hill, N.C.

I will assume for argument's sake that theauthor is not blatantly anti-Semitic, but is only trying to outline thetheories put forward over the centuries which account for the survival of theJewish people in the face of hundreds of years of persecution. This type ofarticle, even when well meant, just further fuels the fires of anti-Semitismand is counter-productive to the ongoing development of peace and civilizationon Earth. Your decision to publish such an article dismays me. I would urge youto remove this article from the Net and avoid this type of journalism in thefuture.                           --David Koppy                                       CharlesPaul Freund replies : Adam Goldstein thinks my style lends credence to Jewsbeing space aliens, Neanderthals, horned devils, etc., while David Koppy saysmy story impedes Earth's peace and civilization. Thanks anyway, but exposure(the story) and scorn (the style) are two available antidotes to the heritageof hatred and dehumanization I described, and which is arguably a biggerproblem than my story.
