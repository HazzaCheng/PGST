                                 Eleven-Twelfths of 1999 In Review            When Chatterbox invitedreaders to nominate events, significant deaths, good and bad movies, etc.,for 1999--a year likely to get little attention in the coming weeks, as newsorganizations choose instead to review the entire century or millennium--theresponse was overwhelming. Chatterbox had promised to publish his official"1999 In Review" item before Thanksgiving, but some distant memory of a scruplepersuaded him to wait till November was over. Nothing ever happens inDecember.            OK, that's not quite true. Hordes of protesters inSeattle are making the World Trade Organization's meeting there a much moreexciting TV story than anyone expected it to be. Reader Dan Crist (whofinds Chatterbox's habit of referring to himself in the third person "ratherannoying and less than professional") points out that Japan bombed Pearl Harborin Dec. 1941. Also, Chatterbox (moonlighting as "Today's Papers"columnist) observed not quite one year ago that the House of Representativescast its second presidential-impeachment vote in U.S. history on Dec. 19, 1998.(That same news-filled day, the U.S. ended an air war against Iraq and BobLivingston said he'd decided not to become House speaker after all.) Two monthsafter the impeachment vote, the Senate failedto convict the president--a highly significant event of 1999 that, for somebizarre reason, slipped Chatterbox's mind until several indignant readers wrotein to remind him of it.            By now, it should be clear that Chatterbox isn't much good at year-in-reviewjournalism. Fortunately, Chatterbox's readers are very good at it. He will nowturn this survey over to them.            ( Disclaimer: Although Chatterbox previously stated that he wouldn'tinclude opinions he disagreed with, that standard proved too confining. WhereChatterbox has solid information or opinions to the contrary, he occasionallyinterjects below. Obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour reader comments werediscarded, but if you don't find your nominee below it doesn't necessarily meanthat it was obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour. )            Here are 20 important things that happened in 1999:            1. Most Hated Celebrity--Ever?                                                          The New York Timesreported on Nov. 10, 1999, that a new record had been set in the latestTimes /CBS poll: [Its] highest negative rating ever scored by a person inthe news. The honor went to Reform Party candidate Donald Trump, who managed tomake an unfavorable impression upon some 70 percent of those polled. The papernoted that this achievement far eclipsed the last comparably negativerating--the 55 percent score attained by Linda Tripp. Presumably this came asno surprise to Mr. Trump, who, upon announcing the formation of a presidential exploratorycommittee on Oct. 7, 1999, had cited polls with "amazing results"--aremark that was widely misinterpreted at the time.                              -- Jodie Allen of U.S. News & World Report (and frequent                     Slate                   contributor)                        2. Most Foolishly Ignored Parts of the World in 1999                                                         The dog that did bark but no one noticed--the political turmoil in thethree great South Asian nations of India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which noware well on the way to passing the three northern Asian nations of China,Japan, and Russia in population (Indonesia is fourth, Pakistan just passed Japan toseventh, India will soon pass China to first). But Americans are still fixatedon northern Asia--Clinton says he must deal with China, because "you can'tignore a billion people with nuclear weapons," but his own policy toward Indiashows that you sure can!                              --Jim Chapin                        3. Worst/Best Films of 1999                                                         Here's my nominee for worst movie of the year (complete category shouldbe: "Worst Movie of the Year That Assumedly Adult Male Reviewers SlatheredOver"):                   There'sSomething About Mary                  --a pathetically sophomoric, penis-obsessed messthat wouldn't even appeal to Larry Flynt!                              -- Felicia, Menlo Park, Cal.                                       Chatterbox replies:                                                         You've got the wrong year. That was 1998 .                                                         [Chatterbox didn't have the heart to add that he thought There'sSomething About Mary was pretty funny, especially the joke about "thefranks or the beans."]                                             Felicia replies:                                                         Oops ... well then, the best of '99 was                   TheRed Violin                  --lyrical, magical, musical, wonderful!                                       [Chatterbox hasn't seen it.]            4. Most Shameless (and Unsuccessful) Attempt To Have It Both Ways in1999 :                                             Sen. Arlen Specter, citing Scottish law, finds Clinton "notproven" on the impeachment charges.                              --Andrew Solovay                        5. Rest in Peace in 1999:                                                         Stanley Kubrick (multiple sources)                                 John KennedyJr. (multiple sources)                                 Susan Strasberg (anonymous tipster; Strasberg played AnneFrank in the original production of the Broadway adaptation, which some peoplethink wasn't Jewish enough)                                 Mel Torme (Steve Reiness)                                 Mrs. Whozit [ Chatterbox interjects : her name was Anne Sheafe Miller], the first person ever to be savedby penicillin (Blair Bolles)                                       6. 1999: The Road Not Taken                                                          What an extraordinary year! Aright-wing conspiracy topples the president, and the governor of Texas revealshimself in a series of debates to be a natural leader with an innate gift forconnecting with his audience, a sure sign of his electoral success next year. Anew Thomas Harris book brilliantly takes us deeper into themind of a serial killer; a new Star Wars movie redefines the very nature ofentertainment; a new Stanley Kubrick film changes the whole national dialogue aboutsex and marriage; a new TV series from the creator of SportsNight --oh, Ican't even bring myself to bash that piece of do-gooder twaddle. If onlyMcDonald's had come out with three more boldly adult-flavored hamburgers, itwould have been a perfect year for dud megaevents--all leading up of course toY2K, the limpest milestone in human history.                              --Mike Gebert                        7 . Children Behaving Badly in 1999                                                         Don't forget Woodstock 1999 --the concert of "peace and love" thatended in a literal blaze of glory when in an hours-long tribute to the originalWoodstock, the mob started ripping down vendor booths and anything else thatwould burn and piling it onto the bonfires scattered about the scene.[ Chatterbox interjects: Didn't people get assaulted and raped, too?]I'm getting all sentimental just thinking about it.                              You also left out all the shooting rampages . Several were done in the name of Godor love supposedly. They were all committed by "quiet, shy" people who "mostlykept to" themselves. I've started to hang around only loud, obnoxiouspeople.                              --Susan Hoechstetter                        8. A Lunatic Rhapsody for the                New York Yankees                                                          The Yankees can actuallybe referred to as the glue that held the century together. Of course, as the1999 World Series champions, they are a significant "story of the year."However, this one singular achievement must be considered in a broadercontext.                              1999 represented the team's 25th championship of the century. This beats, byone, the most championships any one team won during the century. The MontrealCanadiens have won 23 Stanley Cups. However, the Yankees, an American team,playing in the "City of the Century" (so called by me to reflect the amazinggrowth and transformation of one city during this period), who play the"National Pastime," are truly an amazing story.               The team's first championship occurred in 1921; therefore, they have won 25of the last 78 years, nearly one in three. This level of sustained excellenceis not matched in sports or in any other aspect of society. The 1999 win ispossibly the most unique. With free-agency, expansion, and three levels ofplayoffs, it is much harder to win today than in past years. In fact, bywinning three of the last four championships, they are the first team toaccomplish this feat during the eras of free-agency and of divisional play.               The Sultan of Swat, the Iron Man, the Yankee Clipper, the Mick, andYogi--these strong, masculine names are synonymous with the team, the sport,and American history. They went hand in hand with two world wars, Superman, andAmerica's superpower status. The 1999 squad does not feature "a name." Thisteam, with its myriad of human-interest stories, its international roster, andno star, is representative of '90s man, male sensitivity, Pax Americaninterests, and the new political paradigm.                        --Jim Landau from North Potomac, Md. (formerly of the Bronx)            9. A Big Shot Calls for Decriminalizing Drug Use in 1999                                                         New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson came out for ending drug prohibition. Though thisby itself has no immediate effect, it makes it respectable, for the first time,for political leaders to discuss the subject, and thereby brings closer the daywhen the vast majority of crimes will no longer be committed, when billions ofdollars will be freed to help the inner city instead of to ruin black people'slives, and when we will stop, as in Samuel Butler's                   Erewhon                  , imprisoning people for the crime ofbeing sick.                              --Henry Cohen                                       Chatterbox interjects: Didn't Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke do the same thing 11 years ago?            10. Don't Worry in 1999                                                         The DalaiLama proclaimed that most important thing in the world is to behappy.                              --Margaret Taylor                        11.

This year, theobvious one is Kosovo, but the year is also ending with East Timor, where theAussies and their allies successfully stopped the slaughter with nocasualties.                              These followed Haiti, Bosnia, and Rwanda as places where the West delayedsending in troops because of alarmist predictions.               --Jerry Skurnik                        14.

As Jack Shaferwrote in this column, Ronald Reagan, after he left office, was also accusedof having once committed rape. The evidence there was shaky, too.            17. The Most Important Thing of All That Happened in 1999                                                         In 1999, more than half of U.S. homes had a PC, for the first time (i.e.,home-PC penetration passed 50 percent). Of course, most of these PCs crashedall the time, but it's still a significant development. By the way, Internethookups in homes are still well below 50 percent.                              --Walt Mossberg, "PersonalTechnology" columnist for the Wall Street Journal (and occasionalrock-musichistorian for this column)                        18.
