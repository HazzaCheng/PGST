                      What to Do        Sports        Regardless of the time of year you visit these islands,        youll spend most of your time outdoors, on or near the water, and a        word of caution is necessary. The rays of the tropical sun here can        cause serious trouble. In no more than 15 to 20 minutes, fair skin can        be painfully broiled, even in the shade of a coconut tree. For the        first few days youd be well advised to take the sun in extremely small        doses.        Swimming        Coral or volcanic, eggshell white or ashy gray, the sand of        FWI beaches varies from cove to cove. Your hotel may be on an        outstanding beach. If not, theres usually one within easy reach. In        Guadeloupe, the best beaches are on Grande-Terre, as are most of the        hotels. Basse-Terre features both dark volcanic sand in the region of        La Soufrire and beige beaches in the north. Local lore says that you        tan better on black sand.        Martiniques Mount Pele provides the dark coloring for its        northern beaches. Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthlemy, though also        volcanic in formation but without erupting peaks, have only light sand        beaches.        Swimming conditions vary enormously on all the islands.        Youll have no trouble in identifying the many perfectly safe,        protected shores where hardly a ripple disturbs the surface. Otherwise,        there are some beaches or sections of beaches where swimming is less        recommended or even dangerous for all except experts. Coral reefs often        reduce wave strength but may not stem very strong ocean currents,        particularly in the Atlantic. Time of year is also a factor, the winter        months bringing heavier seas. On Martinique the Tourist Office advises        that the safest beaches for poor swimmers are at Sainte-Anne,        Trois-Ilets, Sainte-Luce, Trinit, and Carbet.        Good tidings about the shark situation: no incident        involving a swimmer, snorkeler, or diver has been reported anywhere in        the FWI. Guadeloupe, incredibly, almost never sees a shark anywhere        near its coast. Sightings close to Martinique are very rare and not        much more frequent off the northern FWI. Nonetheless, swimming after        dusk is not advisable.        For a small fee, non-guests may use the beach and facilities        at a number of Guadeloupe and Martinique hotelsa great convenience for        island-hoppers. Alternatively, there are also fine public beaches, and        theyre often deserted.        Many hotels have swimming pools, for those who may be        allergic to sand.        Snorkeling, Skin Diving, Scuba Diving        Underwater sports off the major islands and rocky islets of        the FWI are the highlights of countless vacations. Snorkeling equipment        may be provided free, rented, or bought inexpensively in tourist areas,        so theres no need to bring any from home. Beginners who can stay        afloat can learn to breathe through the tube and peer through the mask        in minutes.        Many of the best snorkeling and underwater photography        areas are offshore at coral reefs or around uninhabited islands; youll        have little difficulty in finding a boat to take you out. Such        multicolored reef dwellers as the parrotfish and French angelfish,        along with weirdly shaped coral, crawfish, or turtles hiding in        crevices, can be yours for the viewing in these clear waters where        visibility of 30 m (100 ft) is common.        Free-dive spear fishing (without air container) is        permitted in the FWI, but always check with local fishermen before        eating anything you catch (see page 117). You should see many of the        following: grouper, amberjack, red or rock hind, stingrays, Atlantic        rays, and moray eels. Equipment may be rented at watersports        establishments.        Scuba (an acronym for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing        Apparatus) is taught and offered at major hotels. This ultimate        subsurface experience is becoming very popular in France, as it has        been for a number of years in the United States. The Caribbeans        transparency and teeming underwater life make it ideal for scuba, and        since the water stays tropically warm year-round you shouldnt need a        full wetsuit.        Boating, Windsurfing, and Water-Skiing        A large number of hotels in the FWI have small boats        available for rent, including the always popular Sunfish. You can also        find instructors to give sailing lessons, as well as all kinds of boat        excursions on which a skipper and crew do the work while you relax.        Windsurfing is making a splash in the FWI: youll see the        colorful sails, boards, and masts all around the islands. It looks        easier than it is: youll need lessons, at least two or three, just to        get you started.        Water-skiing is somewhat harder to find, but certain hotels        do provide motorboats and skis with fixed rates for a 10-minute tour        and an additional fee per lesson. The more tours you buy, the lower the        rate, so water-ski enthusiasts will certainly get value for money.        Sailing and Yachting        With balmy trade winds, infrequent squalls, and flowing sea        currents, the FWI and nearby Antilles are ideal for a day, a week, or a        month under sail. As every islander knows, many of the most gorgeous        coves and beaches are reachable only by boat. For a fairly modest sum        per person, you might consider chartering a skippered sloop or        catamaran for a full day.        From Martinique, the popular 10-day or two-week sail takes        you to St. Lucia and down into the Grenadines. From Guadeloupe, try Les        Saintes and Marie-Galante, which both have safe anchorages or sail        further to Antigua. A 12-m (40-ft) two-masted vessel sleeping a maximum        of six with captain and one crew member can be taken from either        Martinique or Guadeloupefor a small fortune, of course.        To do it yourself, or charter bareboat, youll need to        demonstrate proficiency. Youll find various vessels for charter at the        yachting carnage in Pointe--Pitre, at Fort-de-France, or across its        bay at the Pointe-du-Bout marina, and at Saint-Martins Marigot. During        the peak season (mid-December to mid-April) rates are higher.        Among the yachts advertised for charter in Guadeloupe is a        24-m (80-ft) ketch built for the late King Farouk.        Fishing        The FWI are somewhat removed from the great game-fishing        waters off the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, but the        average angler will find challenges aplenty here from boat or shore.        There are a limited number of deep-sea boats for charter; they normally        accommodate up to four people. Local fishermen might also agree to take        you out in their time-tested, no-frills boats. This may mean youll        have to help with nets or traps, an instructive experience.        Surfcasting with lures (called spinning), is outstanding at        three points in southeast Martinique: Cap Ferr, Cap Macr, and Cap        Chevalier. Local buffs say its also excellent at llet Hardy, Pointe        Baham, and Grand-Rivire. Expect to haul in jacks, barracuda,        yellowtail snapper, tarpon (best with bait off Vauclin), dolphin, red        hind, and jewfish.        Bottom fishing may get you grouper, tarpon, mahogany or red        snapper, parrotfish, grunts, and, rarely, African pompano. In        Martinique the best bottom fishing is probably at Le Robert and Les        Salines.        Guadeloupe, with more fully equipped ocean-going boats than        Martinique, offers deep-sea fishing for kingfish, tuna barracuda,        bonito, and dolphin. You should find some or all of these in        Saint-Martins waters as well, with about a dozen boats available for        charter. Wahoo, one of the big five game fish, is hooked occasionally        off all the islands.        Before frying up your catch, remember to check with local        fishermen about edibility (see page 117).        Golf        A few long fairway shots away from Josephines birthplace        at La Pagerie is Martiniques 18-hole public golf course. Its also        only a short ride (212 km/112 miles) from the Pointe-du-Bout hotels,        some of which have special package arrangements with the club. The        prolific American golfing architect Robert Trent Jones, Sr. , designed        this rolling 6,072-m (6,640-yard) course, a factor ensuring its not        easy to play. Its generally windy here, and there are eight water        holes (including two on the Fort-de-France bay). Guadeloupes course,        also by Jones, at Saint-Franois, is relatively flat, but the winds        here make it quite interesting.  Golf in Saint-Martin is offered only        on the Dutch side of the island.        Greens fees are constant year round. Material for hire        includes electric cars and pull carts. Or you can engage a caddy; its        always pleasant to have company.        Tennis        You will be able to play tennis by day or night at all of        Guadeloupes resort hotels, at most of Saint-Martins, and at some of        Martiniques (where tourists may also use two private clubsTennis        Club de Fort-de-France and Tennis Club du Vieux Moulinwhen the        courts are not in use). Playing away from your hotel will probably be        very expensive during the day and exorbitant under lights. Rackets may        be rented. Surfaces are artificial. Professionals give lessons at many        hotels, the price sometimes included in tennis-package vacations. Until        youre accustomed to the climate, play only before 10 in the morning        and in the late afternoon and evening.        Horseback Riding        There are several stables on Martinique where hotels can        arrange for tourists to rent horses by the hour or the day. Or you can        join an organized group excursion following country trails through        scenic landscapes.        On Guadeloupe, rides in the countryside can be arranged.        For further information contact Comit Guadeloupen des Sports        Equestres, B.P. 758, 97172 Pointe--Pitre.        On St. Barts, La Petite Ferme organizes horseback rides        on Sundays.        Saint-Martin, too, has opportunities for riders in a number        of stables.        Hiking        Guadeloupes huge Natural Park has trails laid out through        the tropical forest, up to major waterfalls, and on to the crater of La        Soufrire. Youll find a printed guide indicating times and difficulty        of various hikes at the Pointe--Pitre tourist office.        On Martinique, trails have been marked through the        Caravelle peninsula nature reserve, and local guides will take you        along more rugged trails around Mount Pele in the north. A hiking path        connects Le Prcheur with Grand-Rivire, advertised as a six-hour        journey.        Shopping        If youre not French, think French. Particularly on        Martinique and Guadeloupe, where the outstanding bargains are in        perfumes, Parisian fashions, crystal, and other luxury items from        France. On duty-free Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthlemy, the range of        best buys is even greater. There are local handicraft items for sale on        all four islands that are interesting and reasonably priced, but shop        off the obvious tourist beat, and dont hesitate to bargain.        At hotel boutiques, prices may or may not be the same as in        urban shopping areas: for anything major, its worth comparing. Opening        hours are as follows: ordinary shops and stores 8am to noon and 2 to        5pm; supermarkets, department stores, and bookshops 8:30am to 12:30pm        and 2:30 to 5:30pm; boutiques 9am to 1pm and 3 to 6pm.        Some stores are open after normal hours or on Sundays or        holidays when cruise ships are in port. Better shops are        air-conditioned.        All of the islands accept American or Canadian dollars        about as readily as French francs. Many shops in Guadeloupe and        Martinique give discounts (usually 20 percent) for purchases in        travelers checks, but not if you pay in foreign currency. On        Martinique youre likely to get the same discount if you pay with one        of the major credit cards.        Neither Martinique nor Guadeloupe enjoy duty-free status        (apart from the duty-free shops at the airports), but almost everything        from France is sold at mainland French prices, well below what the        items would cost in North America.        While Americans returning home must pay 10% duty on        everything above $600 worth of purchases made abroad, the US customs        levy added to the price of an item may still come to less than what the        purchases would cost in Boston or Chicago. Any goods shipped back from        FWI require a 10% duty regardless of the monetary value. (It is illegal        to ship alcoholic beverages. )        A wise idea is to price major items at home before your        vacation. To avoid possible complications with customs, veteran        travelers ask for and retain a receipt (sales slip) for everything        purchased.        Guadeloupes Shopping Scene        Aside from a few boutiques and native crafts shops around        the island, notably in or near hotels, interesting shopping is        concentrated in an area of Pointe--Pitre several city blocks square,        beginning at the cruise ship dock.        Best buys: French perfumes, silk items, porcelain, crystal        liqueurs, and vintage wines.        Good buys: cloth hangings of Creole scenes, seashell        jewelry, straw mats and hats, particularly from Saint-Barthlemy, local        rum, and conch shells (beautiful specimens can be had for just a few        francs apiece from curbside peddlers near the maritime terminal, but        only when a cruise ship is about to depart).        A standard Guadeloupe souvenir is a puffed-up,        porcupine-spined puffer fish (poisson lane), which, if large enough,        can become an offbeat lamp shade. You should also see items crafted        from sharks teeth and occasionally even entire jaws.        Martiniques Shopping Scene        Much of downtown Fort- de-France is fertile territory for        shoppers. For tourists at Pointe-du-Bout its worth taking the        20-minute ferry ride to the capital to investigate prices there before        shopping at the resort hotel boutiques. Elsewhere on the island there        are a handful of craft workshops.        Best buys: perfumes and other French luxury items as listed        for Guadeloupe; youll also find neckties and the best Parisian silk        scarves on sale at reasonable prices (which incorporates a 20 percent        travelers check discount).        Good buys: the islands typical poupe martiniquaise, a        doll in madras Creole costume on sale everywhere; tapestries, wicker        trays, and boxes, and the memorable dark (aged) or white rum.        Before buying anthuriums or other flowers, check your        re-entry regulations at home.        Facing the ferry pier on the Fort-de-France waterfront is        an outdoor pavilion where you might try bargaining for straw hats and        baskets, conch shells, huge wooden forks, or seashell necklaces. Some        of the salesladies at this colorful, soft-sell market wear traditional        Martinique costumes. Fort-de-Frances main shopping streets,        tourist-oriented or not, are between the Savane and the Levassor        River.        Shops on Martinique stock a selection of mainland Chinese,        Philippine, African, Haitian, and Japanese jewelry. Watch for onyx from        Argentina and shark-cartilage pendants from Uruguay, among other exotic        items.        Duty-Free Delights: Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthlemy        For many items, the two small northern islands have the        lowest prices in the Caribbean. Some residents of the duty-free US        Virgin Islands nearby even do their Christmas shopping in Philipsburg,        Marigot, or Gustavia. It takes a while to realize that not just certain        stores, but every store on these islands sells at the same taxless,        duty-free prices.        Almost everything is quoted in US dollars, but, of course,        you can pay in French francs or Netherlands Antilles guilders. While        prices for French perfumes and fashions may not be appreciably lower        here than in the rest of the FWI, they could be half of what Americans        would pay at home.        In all three little capitals, shopping begins where the        boats come in. There are also a few small shops in Grand-Case.        Best buys on French Saint-Martin and to a lesser extent on        St. Barts include: perfumes and cosmetics, luggage, fashions, fabrics        including madras, crystal, leather, figurines, and childrens        clothes.        Savor the French Riviera-style a tmosphere of Marina Port        La Royale, Marigots chic shop-and-dine center on the lagoon side.        At the busy Front Street shops in Philipsburg, you can buy        Delft blue, jewels, Thai silks, linens, Peruvian mirrors, old silver,        and liquor.        Not everything is automatically a bargain: American        tourists may find that certain calculators and cameras, for example,        are just as inexpensive at discount stores back home. However, on        Saint-Martin and St. Barts youll also be saving the city or state        sales tax that may be levied at home.        Local Culture and Events        Music and Dance        Swaying rhythms are among the most appealing aspects of        life in the French West Indies. While islanders of all ages love to        dance, you may have to search a bit nowadays to find the gay and        flirtatious biguine, the romantic Creole mazurka or mazouk, the        sensually suggestive calenda. Like the rest of the Caribbean, the FWI        are inundated by the marvelous steel band calypsos of Trinidad, the        merengue of Dominica, and the reggae and rampanot to mention North        American and European pop musiccourtesy of the transistor, and the        more recently popular craze: zouk.        The authentic FWI dances originated with the African        slaves. Some are adaptations of those of the French plantation masters.        The biguine, immortalized for Anglo-Saxons by Cole Porter, is thought        to have come first to Martinique from the Congo. Those Creole men and        women youll see dancing it properly have been moving their hips and        knees that way since childhood. Dixieland fans will notice the        instrumental similarity to New Orleansbanjo, clarinet, bass, trombone,        and drums.        The laghiain which two men, dancing to drums alone,        simulate a fierce kicking combatarrived with slaves from Dahomey.        Only in the country during patron saint day festivals or at a folk        dance performance are you likely to see rose, a slave womans washing        dance; grage, with dancers mimicking tapioca graters to the beat of        goat-skin drums; the haute-taille, an adaptation with accordion and        drums of a European quadrille; or the bel-air, an African-Creole        version of a three-figure quadrille.        Twenty-five young dancers, singers, and musicians in the        Ballets Martiniquais Folklore group perform traditional local        favorites, as do less formal groups on Guadeloupe. Here youll see the        delightful but slowly disappearing indigenous FWI costumemadras        turban, madras skirt over petticoat, silk peplum, white blouse, and        gold earrings, bracelets, and collier-choux necklace.        Carnival        It may not be the wildest in the Caribbean, but the FWIs        carnival is the longest, by 24 hours. Early in the week there are        pajama, doudou doll, and pirate parades, plus always-spectacular        carnival floats. The riotous revelry roars right past Mardi Gras        (Shrove Tuesday) when red-costumed children star as devils, to its peak        on Ash Wednesday. Downtown Fort-de-France and Pointe--Pitre are        flooded with dancers, notably diablesses, all dressed in black and        white and losing themselves in the biguine. The carnival king, Vaval,        is burned in effigy after dusk, but the frenzied dancing goes on till        after midnight.        Special Events        Aside from carnival and patron saints days in the towns,        youll enjoy:        Fishermens Festival (Fte des Marins Pcheurs) late in        June on Martinique, with parades, fish feasts, and traditional        costumes.        Cooks Festival (Fte des Cuisinires) in early August in        Pointe--Pitre, with a colorful, appetite-stimulating parade, a        religious ceremony honoring Saint Laurent (chosen as the local cooks        patron saint because in a.d. 258 he was burned alive on a rack, which        is now a kitchen utensil) and a monumental free feast with singing,        dancing, and liberal applications of rum punch.        All Saints Day (La Toussaint) 1 November, when, after        dark, in an original and beautiful Antilles tradition, all graves in        cemeteries are illuminated with candles.        Folk Beliefs        Dont sleep in the rays of the moonyour facial features        will be distorted. Pour some rum into a dead mans mouth to cheer him        up, otherwise hell come back to haunt the house. These and other        superstitions are held by many FWI citizens. Many of the strange twigs,        herbs, and packets youll see in the markets have to do with magic        based on traditions that stem from the African origins of most of the        population. This is not, however, the voodoo of Haiti, and there are no        black magic performances staged for tourists.        Early missionaries used to say tiens, bois! (here, drink! )        when they gave medicine to ailing islanders. It seemed magical when        maladies were cured, and from tiens, bois derived the word quimbois,        for magic potion or spell. Today in most villages on Martinique and        Guadeloupe there are still quimboiseurs who mix the mysterious        concoctions. They are considered useful for divining the future,        prescribing remedies for problems, and perhaps putting a spell on an        enemy.        The ordinary tourist will find it difficult to obtain        precise details about this magic, which is known as obeah around the        West Indies.        Nightlife        Theres little danger that the French West Indies will ever        be overrun with swinging after-hours resorts. But Guadeloupe is        making an effort. On its riviera along the southern coast of        Grande-Terre, there are a number of private discotheques and rural        nightclubs in addition to the hotel lounges. Tourists are welcome at        such nightspots, where theyre likely to be outnumbered by        rhythm-loving Guadeloupeans. Advertisements suggest there is striptease        occasionally in this area, logicalor illogical?  on an island        promoting nudism.        On Martinique, all but the most adventurous tourists will        prefer dancing and drinking in their hotels. Here theyll have the        latest calypso mixed with more familiar pop and soul. The admission        charge at hotel lounges includes the first drink. Fort-de-France and        its suburbs have a smattering of very local, very crowded discotheques        where foreigners rarely appear. One reason: most of the islands resort        hotels are quite a distance from the capital.        If folklore performers, steel bands, or limbo dancers visit        your resort area, they usually perform during dinner, so you just sit        down and enjoy the show, generally outdoors.        Guadeloupe and Martinique have a couple of hotel casinos,        modest and low-key by international standards, but perfectly able to        accommodate you if youd like to risk your next years salary. There is        a large, bright, new casino in Schoelcher, the northern outskirt of        Fort-de-France. The casinos, open nightly from 9pm until at least 3am,        offer roulette, American blackjack, baccarat, and sometimes craps, and,        in Martinique, French boule. Drinks are available and expensive.        Theres an admission charge, you must be at least 21 to        enter, and you must present your passport or other official        identification each time you go. At a slightly disadvantageous rate,        you can exchange foreign currency or travelers checks for franc chips.        Succumbing to Caribbean-wide informality, the casinos do not require        men to wear a tie or jacket.        If your French is good or just needs some polishing, both        major islands have movie theaters that show European and American films        with French soundtracks only. Seat prices wont ruin you.        On Saint-Martin, lingering over a seaside dinner is the        preferred after-dark activity on the French side, where most lights go        out by 9 or 10pm. For livelier late-nights spots, head for the Dutch        side with its revues and well-publicized hotel casinos.        On St. Barts, soon after nightfall, the most popular        leisure activity is sleepat least out of season. But a bit of        nightlife is available in the thick of the tourist season.
