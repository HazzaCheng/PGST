United States General Accounting OfficeTestimonyGAOBefore the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Committee onAppropriations,U.S. SenateFor Release on Delivery10:00 a.m. EST May 10, 2001FISCAL YEAR 2002 BUDGET REQUESTU.S. GeneralAccounting OfficeStatement of David M. Walker Comptroller General of the UnitedStatesGAO-01-609TMr. Chairman and Members of theSubcommittee:Good morning! As the Comptroller General of the United States,it is a pleasure to appear before you today to present the GeneralAccounting Office's (GAO's) budget request for fiscal year 2002. Iam proud to say that we served the Congress and the American peoplewell in fiscal year 2000. Our work resulted in substantialfinancial savings and significant improvements to government thatwill benefit all Americans. I am confident that fiscal year 2001will be just as productive.At the outset, I want to thank the Committee for its support inhelping enact GAO's human capital legislation. This legislationwill go a long way toward helping us address many of our humancapital requirements and ensuring that GAO remains prepared to meetthe Congress' needs in the future. We have issued implementingregulations for the early retirement and scientific and technicalstaff provisions and plan to issue authorizing regulations laterthis year to guide any potential future buy-outs andreductions-in-force.GAO's fiscal year 2002 budget request is critical to ourcontinuing efforts to reorganize and reshape the agency, reengineerour business processes, and train and equip our staff withup-to-date technology to help meet Congress' current and futureneeds. Congressional mandates and requests continue to representover 90 percent of our work, and our workload and productivityremain at near-record levels. Our budget request represents ourneeds--not wants--to sustain this level of effort and support tothe Congress.Since becoming the Comptroller General at the beginning offiscal year 1999, GAO's appropriations have been insufficient tofund mandatory and inflation expenses associated with employeecompensation and benefits, and make needed investments in criticalareas, such as technology, training, and performance recognition.We have managed our resource shortages by reducing our staffinglevels and underfunding critical investments. We cannot, and shouldnot, continue this trend.The funds we are requesting are essential to helping us remainprepared to meet the complex, controversial, and multidimensionalissues and challenges confronting the Congress now and in thefuture. Our request includes only those funds we need to stabilizeat our approved 3,275 fulltime equivalent staffing level and toincrementally increase investments needed in training, technology,performance recognition, and other key support items to a levelconsistent with best practices of other comparable government andprivate sector entities.Before I begin detailing our fiscal year 2002 budget needs, Iwould like to highlight some of GAO's accomplishments andachievements in fiscal year 2000 and the major challengesconfronting us.A REVIEW OF GAO'S FISCAL YEAR 2000 ACCOMPLISHMENTSGAO had a tremendous year in fiscal year 2000. As a result ofactions taken on our work by the Congress and federal departmentsand agencies, taxpayers benefited from over $23 billion infinancial savings-a $61 return on every $1 invested in GAO. Ourwork also resulted in significant improvements in governmentoperations and services that will benefit all Americans. Amongother things, by acting on our recommendations, the governmentimproved public health and safety, strengthened national security,better protected consumers, and improved its financial managementand information systems. We also contributed critical informationto public debates on Social Security and Medicare reform and calledattention to looming problems, such as the security of governmentcomputer systems and the knowledge and skills needed in the federalworkforce in coming years. Other indicators of our performance,such as the number of testimonies our senior executives providedand recommendations implemented, exceeded that of most recentyears. I also am pleased to report that we made significantprogress toward addressing many of the organizational, humancapital, and information technology challenges that I outlined foryou at last year's hearing. We had a very busy and productiveyear.Taxpayers Benefit from $23 Billion in Financial SavingsIn fiscal year 2000, GAO helped achieve about $23.2 billion indirect financial benefits for the American taxpayer. These benefitsare a result of the Congress or federal departments and agenciesimplementing our recommendations to make government services moreefficient, improve the budgeting and spending of tax dollars, andstrengthen the management of federal resources. The estimatedfinancial benefits include budget reductions, costs avoided,resources reallocated, and revenue enhancements. These resultsexceeded our target of $22 billion and were greater than that ofthe previous three fiscal years, as illustrated in the followinggraphic.Dollars in billions$23.224 $22.0$20.9$19.7 $20.1 20 16 12 84 019 97 1 998 1 999 2 00 0 200 0 TargetF is cal yearsSome examples of GAO's work that contributed to these financialsavings include the following.Helping to Prevent Fraud and Abuse in Medicare: GAO had longadvocated increased funding specifically for activities to preventfraud and abuse in the Medicare program. In1996, the Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act,which provided the additional funding. As a result of theseactivities, the Medicareprogram's net savings were about $3 billion in fiscal year2000.Cutting Costs of the F-22 Aircraft Program: In a series ofreports beginning in the mid1990s, GAO questioned various aspects of the Air Force's F-22aircraft acquisitionprogram. We reported that the acquisition strategy was risky andthat the program wasexperiencing cost growth, manufacturing problems with testaircraft, and testing delays.Our analysis helped the Congress reduce the final fiscal year2000 appropriation requestfor the F-22 by about $552 million and to identify conditionsthat should be met beforethe Department of Defense could begin full production.Supporting Oversight of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS): GAOcontinued to supportcongressional oversight of IRS' operations, including IRS'implementation of the 1998IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, its budget requests, andadministration of various taxfunctions. For example, our testimony on IRS' broad-basedmodernization effortsprovided an integrated assessment of the challenges IRScontinues to face in its taxenforcement and customer service operations and itsmodernization of performancemanagement, information systems, and business practices. At thesame time, our workgenerated savings and potential reductions in taxpayer burden.Our work on theimproved use of information returns in IRS' tax enforcementoperations yielded $83million in savings this year. IRS also agreed to begin trackinginformation that has thepotential of clarifying its notices to taxpayers and easingtheir task in complying withthose notices.Recapturing Excess HUD Funding: GAO identified funding fromseveral sources in theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's budget, includingunexpendedbalances no longer needed, that could be recaptured in fiscalyears 1998 and 1999. TheCongress rescinded $1.65 billion from the Section 8 housingprogram's fiscal year 1998budget authority and rejected $1.3 billion of HUD's fiscal year1999 request for housingassistance for a total reduction of $2.95 billion. Subsequently,GAO and HUD workedtogether to revise HUD's analysis to show that, by usingrecaptured funds, HUD hadsufficient funding to meet its needs.Almost 800 Actions Taken To Improve Government Operations orServicesGAO's recommendations and audit findings also resulted in orcontributed to many improvements in the effectiveness andefficiency of government operations and services during fiscal year2000. While immeasurable in dollar terms, they contributed toimproving public safety and consumer protection, establishing moreeffective and efficient government operations, and safeguarding thenation's physical and information infrastructure. We recorded 788actions taken in response to our recommendations to improve how thefederal government operates, a number far exceeding that of thepreceding 3 years as illustrated in the following graphic.788 800 607 620537 600Number of actions391 4002000 1997 1998 1999 2000 2000TargetFiscal yearExamples of GAO's work that resulted in these accomplishmentsfollow.Improving Nursing Home Quality of Care: The Health CareFinancing Administration (HCFA) and several states-includingCalifornia, Maryland, and Michigan-improved their oversight andenforcement of nursing homes' quality of care standards in responseto GAO's recommendations highlighting weaknesses in existingprocesses. Improvements included increased funding for nursing homesurveyors, more prompt investigation of complaints alleging seriousharm to residents, more immediate enforcement actions for homeswith repeated serious problems, a reorganization of HCFA's regionalstaff to improve consistency in oversight, and increased fundingfor administrative law judges to reduce the backlog of appealedenforcement actions.Managing Wildfire Prevention: -Federal Experts Saw MassiveWildfires Coming" read an August 7, 2000, news headline. Thearticle was referring to GAO's April 1999 report on wildfires.Since then, GAO has used the increased risk of uncontrollable andoften catastrophic wildfires as an example of the need for"strategic budgeting" to address issues that are not aligned withthe current budget and organizational structures of the four majorfederal land management agencies. Responding to the wildfires thatburned over 6.5 million acres of public and private land in 2000,the Congress appropriated an additional $240 million in fiscal year2001 to reduce hazardous fuels in high-risk locations wherewildlands and urban areas meet. GAO testified on the need for thefour land management agencies to act quickly to develop a frameworkto spend funds effectively and to account accurately for what theyaccomplish with the funds.Improving Human Capital Practices: Our work on human capitalissues helped focus the attention of the executive and legislativebranches on the importance of these issues,particularly in managing for results. We helped spur theadministration to make humancapital a priority management objective in the fiscal year 2001budget submission, andour framework for human capital self-assessment is being used atother agencies,including the Social Security Administration, Small BusinessAdministration, NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, and EnvironmentalProtection Agency. Theframework also is used throughout GAO to help guide our researchand developmentwork and our congressionally driven examinations of how wellagencies are pursuingstrategic human capital management in support of their missionsand goals. We havedesignated strategic human capital management as one of thefederal government's highrisk areas in our 2001 Performance and Accountability Series andHigh-Risk Update.Strengthening Information Security: GAO has evaluated thesecurity of criticalinformation systems at federal agencies and recommended numerousimprovements,most recently at three Treasury agencies, the Department ofEnergy, Department ofVeterans Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Agency. InSeptember 2000, GAOissued a governmentwide perspective on federal informationsecurity that coveredInspector General and GAO audit findings reported since July1999. We concluded thatweak security continues to be a widespread problem that placescritical and sensitivefederal operations at risk of tampering, disruption, andinappropriate disclosure. InOctober 2000, government information security reform provisionswere enacted into lawto strengthen information security practices throughout thegovernment.Stabilizing the Balkans: Despite the presence of two largeforces led by the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization, the Balkans remain volatile. GAO'swork has shown thatthe international operations in Bosnia and Kosovo face severeobstacles to achievingenduring peace and stability. Most local leaders and members oftheir respective ethnicgroups have not embraced the political and social reconciliationneeded to buildmultiethnic, democratic societies. Our work also has shown thatthe internationalcommunity has not provided the resources that the United Nationsmission in Kosovosays it needs, particularly for building a civilian policeforce. If progress is not madewith these matters, violence may escalate or armed conflict mayresult.Requests for GAO Testimony and Implementation ofRecommendations IncreasedIn fiscal year 2000, the number of times that GAO's seniorexecutives testified before the Congress and the rate at which ourrecommendations were implemented exceeded that of most recentyears. Because GAO's primary function is to support the Congress incarrying out its decision-making and oversight responsibilities,the number of times our experts testify before congressional panelseach year is an indicator of our responsiveness and reflects theimpact, importance, and value of our work. In fiscal year 2000, GAOofficials testified 263 times before 104 different House and SenateCommittees and Subcommittees, more than half of all congressionalcommittees and subcommittees. Our experts testified on a broadrange of issues of national importance, including arms control,health care, Social Security, human capital, nuclear waste cleanup,wildfire prevention, aviation safety and security, internationaltrade, computer security, financial management and reform, andbudget issues.Our assistance to the Congress at public hearings continues toremain high, as illustrated below. However, it is clear that thenumber of congressional oversight hearings and other GAO testimonyopportunities will decline significantly in fiscal year 2001 as aresult of factors beyond our control. Among these include the slowstart of the 107th Congress due to the power sharing arrangementsin the Senate, closer margins and committee leadership changes inthe House, and delay in filling many Bush Administration policypositions.Number of testimonies256 263 270 229 230182180900 1997 1998 1999 2000 2000TargetFiscal yearWe also exceeded our performance of previous years with respectto the rate at which the recommendations we made 4 years ago wereimplemented. We use a 4-year interval because our historical datashow that agencies often need time to take action on ourrecommendations. By the end of fiscal year 2000, 78 percent of therecommendations we made in fiscal year 1996 had been implemented.As illustrated in the graphic below, this rate exceeds that of thepreceding 3 years. Implemented recommendations correct theunderlying causes of problems, weaknesses in internal controls,failures to comply with laws or regulations, or other mattersimpeding effective and efficient performance.Percent of recom m en dations im plem ented74 73788069 70 60 40 2001997 1998 1999 2000 2000 TargetFiscal yearSignificant Progress Made Addressing Management and OperationalIssuesLast year, I outlined for you a number of major management andoperational challenges facing GAO. These challenges included humancapital, information technology, organizational, job processes, andcommunication issues within the agency. I am pleased to report thatwe made significant progress toward addressing many of theseissues.We continued to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency througha variety of means during fiscal year 2000, including issuing astrategic plan, establishing congressional protocols, realigningthe agency, implementing key human capital initiatives, andincreasing the use of information technology. These efforts toenhance and strengthen GAO and its services to the Congress and theAmerican people include the following.In the Spring of 2000, we issued our first strategic plan forthe 21st century based on input from the Congress and supplementedby GAO's own expertise and other outreach efforts. The plan focuseson how we intend to support the Congress in helping to shape a moreefficient and effective government. It describes our role andmission in the federal government; the core values that guide ourwork; the trends, conditions, and external factors underlying ourplan; and our goals, objectives, and strategies for serving theCongress. Our intent is to update the strategic plan every 2 yearsfor each Congress.We established a set of congressional protocols to govern ourinteractions with and ensure our accountability to the Congress.These protocols, which underwent a 9month pilot test, set outclear, transparent, consistently applied policies and practices forGAO's relations with the Congress to reduce miscommunication andensure that all requesters are treated equitably. The finalprotocols were issued in November 2000.We continued our outreach efforts to understand how best to meetcongressional needs and assist the Congress in using our resourcesand services. During each Congress, I and other GAO executives planto meet with the leadership of the Senate and House, all CommitteeChairs and Ranking Minority Members, and Members of our oversightand appropriations committees to obtain feedback on our performanceand information needed to update our strategic plan.We issued our first-ever Accountability Report to the Congressdiscussing our performance and accountability in serving theCongress and the American people in fiscal year 1999. The reportreviews our accomplishments in meeting our mission and sustainingour core values of accountability, integrity, and reliability. Wealso issued a performance plan for fiscal year 2001 that containsthe performance measures and annual performance targets we will useto gauge progress toward accomplishing our strategic goals andobjectives.We also realigned the agency to better support the Congress andprepare ourselves with current and expected resource levels to meetthe future challenges outlined in our strategic plan. To alignGAO's structure with the goals in our strategic plan, wereorganized both our field and headquarters operations. The changeswere primarily designed to better align our resources with ourstrategic plan, eliminate a layer of managerial hierarchy, reducethe number of organizational units, increase internal and externalcoordination activities with the Congress and other accountabilityorganizations, clarify the roles and responsibilities ofmanagement, increase the number of personnel who perform ratherthan manage or review work, and increase the critical mass andenhance the flexibility of field resources.We also began implementing a range of new and enhanced humancapital and information technology strategies to position GAO forfuture success. Thanks to the Congress, we now have legislativeauthority that provides us greater flexibility to effectivelymanage our human capital. This legislation, enacted into law inOctober 2000, grants us the authority to establish new senior-levelscientific and technical positions; offer targeted voluntaryearly-outs and buy-outs; and carry out reductions in force todownsize, realign, or correct skills imbalances within our agency.We have issued implementing regulations for early-outs and thescientific and technical positions and plan to issue buy-out andreductions-in-force authorizing regulations later this year.Other accomplishments within the human capital area include:Completion of a first-ever electronic knowledge and skillsassessment and inventory that is being used to help identify skillgaps and succession planning needs within the agency. In addition,staff completed an employee preference survey that is being usedalong with the results of the knowledge and skills inventory tomeet our institutional work needs while accommodating staffpreferences for engagements to the extent possible.Significant recruiting and college relations efforts on thenation's campuses. Aggressive efforts are underway to attract,recruit, and hire high-caliber staff with the skills and abilitiesneeded to assist GAO in achieving our strategic goals andobjectives.Revised performance standards for all staff that incorporateGAO's core values and strategic goals, update descriptions ofperformance to better reflect the current nature of GAO's work, andinclude key management and performance concepts, such as leadershipby example, client service, and measurable results. Also, duringfiscal year 2000, we began a major initiative to develop acompetency-based performance appraisal system for analysts toreflect prevailing best practices. In fiscal year 2001, we willbegin updating the performance systems for attorneys and missionsupport staff to reflect prevailing best practices.Enhanced internal communications that remain a vital tool forchange management throughout the agency. Throughout fiscal year2000, I conducted a number of telecasts to all agency staff todiscuss GAO's strategic plan and congressional protocols, clientservice, employee survey results, initiatives to enhance theagency's human capital programs and legislative proposals, workprocesses, organizational alignment, information technology, andother areas of interest to the staff. Also, to engage our employeesmore fully in improving the agency's performance, we establishedthe Comptroller General's Employee Advisory Council to discusscurrent and emerging issues of mutual interest and concern andimplemented an employee suggestion program that received more than800 submissions in its first year of operation.We also made significant gains in strengthening and improvingour operations and processes in fiscal year 2000. We implementedtwo new management strategies: risk management and matrixmanagement. GAO's risk management approach allows management toidentify and involve key stakeholders throughout an engagement totranscend traditional organizational boundaries to maximizeinstitutional value and minimize related risks. GAO's matrixmanagement approach maximizes our value to the Congress byleveraging the knowledge, skills, and experience of all employeesto ensure the highest quality products and services and to help theCongress address the challenging, complex, multidimensionalproblems facing the nation.Throughout fiscal year 2000, we also continued to improve ouruse of information technology as a tool for productivity andknowledge management. To provide our teams of analysts with amechanism for simplifying and standardizing their work, we launchedthe Electronic Assistance Guide for Leading Engagements--the EAGLE,which is a prototype of a comprehensive Webbased guide toconducting GAO engagements. We also continued to enhance thecapabilities of our computer network and successfully made oursystems Y2K compliant. In addition, we began a number of projectson enabling technologies, including software upgrades, thedeployment of notebook computers, and improved remote access toallow teams to work more efficiently in the field. Also, to carryout GAO's responsibilities under the Presidential Transition Act of2000, we developed a separate section on our Internet web site withlinks to key GAO contacts and reports on the major executive branchagencies, which was completed at the beginning of fiscal year2001.FISCAL YEAR 2001 PLANS AND FUTURE CHALLENGESDuring fiscal year 2001, we will continue to focus our work onthe major issues facing the Congress, including Social Securitysolvency, education, economic development, Medicare reform,national security, international affairs, and government managementreforms and computer security. Another top priority this year willbe working with leaders on the Hill to help the Congress strengthenits approach to oversight, with an emphasis on looking hard at whatgovernment does, how it does it, and the long-term consequences oftoday's policy choices. GAO's 2001 Performance and AccountabilitySeries and High-Risk Update will serve as a solid foundation forcongressional oversight. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we haveseveral key initiatives in progress to improve how we serve theCongress, among them an expanded client feedback system; protocolsgoverning our dealings with federal agencies; new high-leveladvisory bodies to gain the expertise of business leaders, formerCabinet officials, and other experts; and new avenues for sharingour own expertise with other accountability organizations.We also are preparing to carry out two new responsibilitiesmandated by the previous Congress. We will chair a panel to reviewthe government's A-76 process for obtaining services throughcompetitive sourcing. Also, if the needed funding is provided, wewill review the costs and benefits of major regulations under theTruth in Regulating Act (P.L. 106-312, Oct. 17, 2000). We have arequest pending for $2.6 million in supplemental funding for fiscalyear 2001 and are requesting $5.2 million for fiscal year 2002 tomeet the requirements created by the Truth in Regulating Act.Internally, we will continue to emphasize initiatives to addressour two major management challenges: human capital and informationtechnology. With about 80 percent of our resources devoted to staffsalary and benefits, the area of human capital presents a majorchallenge. A significant percentage of our workforce is nearingretirement age, while marketplace, demographic, economic, andtechnological changes indicate that competition for skilled workerswill be greater in the future. With our agency realigned tofacilitate our work for the Congress and new legislative authorityin hand to manage our workforce more effectively, we are pursuingseveral initiatives to strengthen our human capital. For example,we are recruiting diverse, highcaliber staff with the skills andabilities we need to achieve our strategic goals and objectives. Wewill be putting into place a competency-based performance appraisalsystem and using the results of our staff knowledge and skillsinventory to help us in workforce planning. We also havereestablished and are expanding training opportunities for ourstaff-from the senior executives to the new hires.Another major management challenge is building an integrated andreliable information technology (IT) infrastructure that supportsthe achievement of our goals. We are conducting a comprehensive ITreview to identify opportunities to increase our efficiency,effectiveness, and productivity. We also are mapping our businessprocesses to our IT architecture and will link future ITinvestments to our business goals. In addition, we plan to continueinitiatives to increase our employees' productivity, maximize theuse of technology, and enhance the Webbased knowledge-sharingapplications on the desktop. Last, we also must heighten thesecurity of our network.FY 2002 BUDGET REQUESTTo fully support the Congress as outlined in our strategic planand the additional congressional mandates received since itsissuance, we are requesting a budget for fiscal year 2002 of about$430.3 million. This funding level will allow us to support andstaff to our approved level of 3,275 full-time equivalentpersonnel. We will increase our emphasis on areas of congressionaland public interest and, internally, will continue to emphasizeinitiatives to address our two major management challenges: humancapital and information technology. Our request also includes $5.2million to carry out new responsibilities created by the Truth inRegulating Act. In addition, we are seeking a nominal increase inGAO's representation expenses, from $10,000 to $12,500, toaccommodate our expanded role with both domestic and internationalaccountability organizations.Additional funding in fiscal year 2002 is being requestedfor:mandatory pay and benefit costs resulting primarily from federalcost-of-living and locality pay adjustments, based on Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) guidance, increased participation inthe Federal Employees Retirement System, and an increase in theestimated number of retirees--$17,554,000;uncontrollable inflationary increases in transportation,lodging, postage, printing, supplies, contracts, and otheressential mission support services, based on OMB's 2percentinflation index and other factors--$1,565,000; anduncontrollable contract rate increases in building operationsand maintenance and information technologyprograms--$1,453,000.Funding of $8,004,000 for salaries and benefits also is beingrequested to staff and support our approved 3,275 full-timeequivalent staffing level. We plan to use these resources toenhance our review efforts in areas of congressional and publicinterest and concern, such as government computer security, SocialSecurity solvency, education, economic development, Medicarereform, and international affairs.The additional funds requested also would be used to continueinitiatives begun in fiscal year 2000 that are critical tosupporting the Congress and the goals and objectives identified inour strategic plan. These initiatives include human capitalinitiatives and enabling technological advances to enhance theperformance and productivity of our workforce as follows.Human capital initiatives--$3,324,000: Enabling technologyinitiatives to increase employee productivity, maximize the use oftechnology, and enhance employee tools available at the desktop,including such initiatives as reengineering business processes,upgrading hardware and software applications, expanding ourvideoconferencing capabilities, and implementing a best practicesnetwork security program--$2,585,000.Other efforts include:Enhancing security and removing asbestos within the GAO Buildingto protect the health and safety of our most important asset-ourstaff--$2,839,000;Upgrading GAO's computer security facility to ensure ourcontinued ability to conduct effective, comprehensive computersecurity controls testing of complex, diverse, and interconnectedexecutive branch systems and to attract and retain skilled,technical staff--$750,000;Enhancing the International Organization of Supreme AuditInstitution's efforts to combat government related corruptionaround the world, multi-lateral training efforts with eastern-blocand selected South and Latin American countries, and bilateralassistance to Russia--$250,000; andContracting for the development of a requirements document to beused along with other legislative branch agencies to jointlyprocure and share a common financial managementsystem--$250,000.In addition, as previously mentioned, we are requesting $5.2million to provide the annual funding requirement specified in theTruth in Regulating Act.BUDGET REQUEST CRITICAL TO SUSTAINING EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICETO THE CONGRESSThe resources we are requesting for fiscal year 2002 arecritical to addressing our human capital and information technologychallenges and ensuring our ability to effectively meet theincreasing congressional requests for GAO services. We have reacheda point that if sufficient funding is not received to address theseissues and properly support our staff, we will need to take actionsthat will negatively impact our service and responsiveness to theCongress.Congressional demand for GAO services continues to increase. Forexample, as illustrated below, the number of engagements begun as aresult of a congressional request has increased during the past 4years. These numbers do not include hundreds of other requests thathad not yet been started.We have worked hard over the past 3 years with availableresources to significantly increase our productivity levels tosuccessfully meet increasing congressional demand. For example, werealigned our organization, reengineered many of our businessprocesses, retooled our engagement and risk management practices,revised our performance appraisal and recognition systems, andupdated our information technology infrastructure. However, we havereached a point that significant additional productivity gains areunlikely without sufficient funding to further enhance our humancapital and information technology programs.We are concerned about our ability to continue to increase ourproductivity levels, sustain our return on investment, and meetfuture congressional demands given the recent trend in our fundinglevels. Since becoming the Comptroller General at the beginning offiscal year 1999, I have not asked for any increase in our approved3,275 full-time equivalent staffing level. I have only requestedthe funding necessary to properly maintain and support thisstaffing level and cover mandatory expenses, including inflationand compensation costs. However, as illustrated in the followinggraphic, the funding GAO received has been significantly less thanwhat we requested and needed to support our approved staffinglevel.In order to cover our mandatory expenses during the past 3years, we had to staff well below our approved staffing level, asillustrated below, and delayed or made reduced investments inimportant human capital and information technology initiatives. Asa result of these funding shortfalls and the mandated fundingreductions in the mid-1990s, our training, performancebasedrecognition and rewards programs are not where they need to be.Consequently, we are at a competitive disadvantage with theexecutive branch in some areas, such as performance rewards. Inaddition, we have some management information systems that areobsolete and incapable of interfacing within our networkenvironment and a variety of software that needs to be upgraded toensure continued vendor maintenance and support. We cannot continuedown this path. We have reached the point at which investments inthese critical programs and other areas must be made in order toeffectively support our staff and provide the high level of serviceexpected and required by the Congress.3,4003,325 3,275 3,275 3,2753,192 3,1553,0001999 2000 2001Fiscal year FTEs RequestedFTEs UsedThe funds we are requesting are critical to addressing oursuccession planning challenges and enhancing the knowledge, skills,and abilities of our workforce. A large percentage of our workforcewill become eligible for retirement within the next 5 years. Morethan 35 percent of our analysts and 50 percent of our seniorexecutives will be retirement eligible within that time period. Weneed to aggressively continue our efforts to hire new staff,develop existing staff, and otherwise build the future GAO. Inorder to be competitive in attracting, hiring, and retaining highcaliber and talented staff, we need to be able to further enhanceour human capital programs. Thus, the funding we are requesting fortraining, performance-based recognition and compensation programs,education loan repayments, mass transit subsidy allowance, andenabling technology is critical. Without such funding, we will notbe competitive in attracting and retaining the best, brightest, andexpertise needed to effectively serve the Congress in addressingthe complex, controversial, and multidimensional issues andchallenges it faces each year.If the funding trend of the past 3 years is continued, we willneed to restrict our work to only responding to requests fromcommittees and subcommittees, thus severely limiting-andpotentially eliminating-work done for individual members. Such arestriction also would further reduce the limited flexibility wehave to research and develop expertise on emerging issues, therebylimiting our ability to respond to the Congress when related issuesarise on short notice. For example, were it not for the advanceresearch and development work we had done on computer security,China, the World Trade Organization, and last year's presidentialelection issues, we would have been unable to be responsive to thecongressional requests and public debates on these real time, eventdriven issues. We need sufficient funding to build and ensure wehave the capacity and expertise to address such emerging issues onshort notice in the future.sETFfor3,200ebmuNCONCLUDING REMARKSFiscal year 2000 was a tremendous year of accomplishment andachievement for GAO  a year of great service to the Congress andof great benefit to the American taxpayer. We have made significantprogress in addressing many of the areas in need of improvement inGAO and need to continue these efforts. The resources we arerequesting for fiscal year 2002 are critical to sustaining ourhigh-level of performance and service to the Congress. We are thenation's and possibly the world's leading accountabilityorganization. We need these additional resources to continue ourefforts to further strengthen GAO and be a model organization forthe rest of the federal government and accountability organizationsaround the world. In addition, given GAO's impressive results andreturn on investment, it only makes sense for GAO to receiveresource allocations that are well above average for other federalentities. To do otherwise would send a troubling message to GAO'semployees, the press, and the public.We look forward to your continued support and working even moreclosely with you and your staff this year and in fiscal year 2002.This concludes my statement. I would be pleased to respond to anyquestions that the Members of the Subcommittee may have.Orders by InternetFor information on how to access GAO reports on the Internet,send an email message with "info" in the body toinfo@www.gao.govor visit GAO's World Wide Web home page athttp://www.gao.govTo Report Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in Federal ProgramsWeb site: http://www.gao.gov/fraudnet/fraudnet.htm Email:fraudnet@gao.gov Automated answering system: 18004245454
