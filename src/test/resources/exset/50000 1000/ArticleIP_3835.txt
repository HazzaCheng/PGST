If stadiums are such a good business deal,why aren't they readily funded by private enterprise without major municipalsupport? The funds are out there and available when companies, banks, andventure capitalists need a few billion to buy up some competitor. My suspicionis that the absence of private capital proves that stadiums are not a good dealexcept for the select few on the inside who are subsidized by other people'smoney.            --JimCerny                           No Rain,No Gain                        One ofJohn Pastier's assertions ("Diamondsin the Rough") leaves me perplexed. He states that Seattle "has the driestweather in MLB outside California." Is this the same Seattle I know? Is thisthe same Seattle described in a past issue of Newsweek , which featuredSLATE's editor on the cover in a rain slicker?

Chris DeMuth's contribution is an outstandingillustration of the ideological dead weight carried by Bob Dole's campaign sofar. The stable of think-tank hobby horses being promoted (school choice,abortion, and missile defenses) is as bloated as the government DeMuth decries.Borrowing from DeMuth, I ask, "Is Dole any less constrained than Bill Clinton'by powerful constituency groups within the [Republican] Party'?"

The economics articles, while a good idea,have proven fairly trivial and even pedestrian. Steven E. Landsburg's commentson the national debt ("Kwitcherbellyachin'") were neither enlightening nor humorous,leading me to wonder why you bothered running the piece.            SLATE clearly seems to havealready taken a political slant to the right. Its content is proof enough.Clinton's affiliation with a labor leader is hardly surprising ("The Clintons andthe Mob," by Jodie T. Allen), even less so to one who supported hisposition on NAFTA. What is surprising is the temerity of running an articletitled "The Clintons and the Mob" when the "mobster" in question has neitherbeen convicted of nor indicted for racketeering. Indeed, the author onlyestablishes a connection between Coia and the first family; evidence oforganized criminal activities was weakly presented. This smacks ofirresponsible journalism.            In another article, "TheWarlords of Democracy," by Paul Goble, you offer a link to a Ronald Reaganspeech, at the end of which is a command to "go back." Dutifully followinginstructions, I find myself in a GOP Web site endowed with the collected wisdomof such luminaries as Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh.            Iunderstand that this publication is still developing. I certainly hope itdevelops into a well-balanced, responsible journal, but that is not thedirection I perceive.            --Craig Schultz                           War andRemembrance                        PaulGoble is not the first person to discover that even the best forms ofgovernment are prone to engage in war ("Warlordsof Democracy"). Nor is his analysis more penetrating than that of otherswho have made the same discovery. Goble's suffers by comparison to K.N. Waltz'sin his 1959 book, Man, the State, and War . Nevertheless, Goble's pointis one that bears repeating, if only because it seems to be so easilyforgotten.            --RendellDavis                           C+ forDemocracy                        It's no surprise thatdemocracy isn't perfect ("Warlordsof Democracy," by Paul Goble). It is essentially an averaging of thepeople, and like any average, it falls somewhere between the best and theworst. The decisions a democracy arrives at won't be as good as those the bestpeople in the country would have made, but neither will they be as bad as whatthe worst would have done. The second part is the most important side of theequation.            Abenevolent dictatorship would be the best form of government, except for onedistressing fact. Nobody's figured out how to make sure the dictator willactually be benevolent before giving him the reins of power.

The term "peaceful democracy" is almost a contradiction interms. The justification of democracy is that it provides the greatest level offreedom to its citizens. There is an old saying, "You can have peace or you canhave freedom. But never count on having both at the same time." There willalways be threats to democracy and freedom from people who want more power,land, etc., and who are willing to use force to achieve their goals.            Democracies have always preferred peace to war. War is expensive and wastefulin terms of human life as well as economics. If the alternative is to lose ourfreedom, then we must be warlike to preserve it.            --JosephBiener                           RightIn                        I'm a far right, reactionary,radical, mean-spirited, child-starving, Limbaugh-loving ditto-head Republican(who for years thought Goldwater was a Commie, and was proved right).

Bahr                           FeelingTheir Pain                        Stephen Chapman ("What'sWrong With 'Victims' Rights' ") expresses some practical concernsregarding the Victims' Rights Amendment. However, there is great danger in theamendment's subtext.            There are severaljustifications for taking a convicted criminal's freedom away. The mostneglected rationale, but the one closest to our spiritual traditions, isrehabilitation. Other legitimate objectives include removing predators from thegeneral population and setting an example to deter potential criminals. Theimpulse animating the Victims' Rights Amendment, however, is different. Itseeks to assuage the pain of victims by allowing them to participate in thesuffering of those who hurt them.            This cannot be called wrong.How can one tell parents that they should not want to see the person who rapedand killed their child punished? Nevertheless, it is not a principle thatshould be honored with a place in the Constitution. It does not consider thegreater good of broad society; the amendment is a revenge wish, pure andsimple.            The realproblem with the Victims' Rights Amendment is that it undermines the moralauthority of justice.            --WilliamGadea                           Kill andAsk Questions Later                        ReadingRobert Wright's piece about the prospects for human cooperation ("Interdependence Day"), I wonder how he might incorporate fear intothe theory of strategic bonding. It seems to me that the instinct for survivalplays as much a role in the trust or distrust among the races as genetics. I'vealways felt that a chief cause of racial strife is that on a primal,instinctive level, we distrust something new or different from what we know. Ifwe encounter this new, different animal when we are alone, our instinct tellsus to run away. If we outnumber this alien being, our instinct tells us to killit and ask questions later (or, at the very least, discriminate against it andkeep it in a manageable place). Only by understanding the alien being, andfeeling unthreatened by its presence, will the instinct to control it beneutralized.            --DaleKutzera                           BadJudgment Call                        I was surprised by "TheBull Street Journal." My reaction while reading it was to beembarrassed for SLATE, because the whole feature smells like a juvenile attemptto slam a competitor via the most unprofessional means. The kind of SLATE I wascoming to enjoy reading was one that would rip the Wall Street Journalapart using facts, ideas, and finely honed reasoning. There is no place in thatkind of SLATE for this kind of high-school parody of a competingpublication.            SLATE is still new, soperhaps this is the kind of thing that can be written off as inexperience.            I'll keepreading, but no longer will I assume that SLATE will always exercise good (oreven average) editorial judgment in its selection of features.            --TerryO'Neill                           Save Roomfor Dessert                        I wasrather annoyed to find that both the theater and art reviews in this week'sSLATE ("Quel Drag!" by Larissa MacFarquhar, "New York State ofMind," by Louis Menand") cover minor events in Manhattan. I hope this isn'ta sign that SLATE will follow the lead of many of its print counterparts bylicking every crumb from New York's cultural plate while completely ignoringmajor events that occur elsewhere.            --RobertLauriston                           Factsand Filters                        Professor Eugene Volokh mayhave created more confusion than he dispelled in SLATE ("Speechand Spillover"). Not only does Volokh blur the constitutional issues raisedby legislation like the Communications Decency Act, but he also misinformsreaders about the function and effectiveness of software-content filters--factsthat are central to understanding the public debate about regulating content onthe Net.            There are many problems withVolokh's First Amendment discussion, but most seem to follow from two basicerrors. First, Volokh fails to note that the Supreme Court has conditioned thescope of the government's authority to broadly regulate constitutionallyprotected content (such as nonobscene sexual content) on the specificcharacter of the medium distributing that content. At the risk ofoversimplifying, we may say that the court has allowed the government greaterauthority to regulate "indecent" content either when broadcast (e.g., radiobroadcasting in the Pacifica case) or delivered in a mannerindistinguishable in character--to the audience, at least--from broadcasting(e.g., cable television in this year's Denver Consortium case).            Second, Volokh conflatesthree distinct (if overlapping) categories of content: "indecent," "sexuallyexplicit," and (by implication) "pornographic." In doing so, he reinforces acommon confusion about the Communications Decency Act--namely, that its reachwas limited only to pornographic material. But as the judges in ACLU vs.Reno noted, the terms of the CDA criminalized a far broader range ofspeech--speech that is "indecent" or "patently offensive"--much of which is not"sexually explicit" as those words are normally understood. (Not all speechthat's indecent or patently offensive is about sex, Howard Sternnotwithstanding.)            The judges also observedthat the plaintiffs in ACLU vs. Reno (ranging from Microsoft andWired magazine to organizations such as Human Rights Watch and theNational Writers Union) were easily distinguishable from the commercialpornographers whose dial-a-porn services were at issue in SableCommunications vs. FCC (1989). That's why it's particularly troubling tosee Volokh cite Sable, a case about regulating minors' access tocommercial pornography, in support of a more general claim that governmenthas broad power to regulate nonpornographic "indecent" or "sexually explicit"content in the interest of protecting children. (Justice White, writing for thecourt in Sable, does not go so far. Instead, he relies on two cases that, likeSable, involve pornography and minors. White never expressly states inSable that the government has constitutional authority toregulate--regardless of the medium--the far broader category of speech called"indecency.")            These two basic legal errorsgive rise to other problems with Volokh's constitutional analysis. Mostnotably, he suggests compulsory labeling of online content without mentioningthe First Amendment problem of "compelled speech" that clearly would arise, andwithout discussing whether such compulsory labeling would be constitutional ifimposed on books and newspapers. (Medium-specific analysis suggests it wouldn'tbe, and factual record in ACLU vs. Reno seems to entail the sameconclusion about compulsory labeling on the Internet.)            But perhaps the single mostdisturbing error in his article has to do with the facts, not the law. In orderto support his thesis that technical solutions will never resolve what he seesas a perennial "spillover" problem, Volokh attempts to raise doubts about theeffectiveness of selection/filtering software such as SurfWatch:                           TheSurfWatch solution is limited by the software designers' ability to keep upwith the latest 'dirty' places. Dozens of Web sites are being added daily, andyou never know what will get posted tomorrow even on existing sites ornewsgroups. Some things will inevitably be missed.                                       Thepurely technological fix, then, is less restrictive than the CDA, but it's alsoless effective.                        What Volokh implies here(that filters rely solely or primarily on a list of "dirty places") is whollyfalse--not just about SurfWatch, but about filtering software and filteringparadigms generally. We know of no product that operates as Volokh suggestsSurfWatch does--while many such programs do include specific lists ofobjectionable sites, this is not the primary approach any of these programsrely on to filter content . This is true even though filtering paradigms maydiffer among products: SurfWatch uses multiple approaches, including keyword-and pattern-matching algorithms; the company uses its "blocked site" list as asupplement to its core filtering technologies. NewView's Specs for Kidsprogram, in contrast, doesn't use a "blocking" strategy at all--instead itreviews and rates sites (147,000 as of this writing), and admits minors only tothose pre-approved sites. SurfWatch's continuing success during a period inwhich the total number of Web sites has boomed undercuts Volokh'sgeneralization about the effect of the boom on these filters' effectiveness.This makes sense--block the word "sex" in a Web address, and it doesn't matterif the number of Web addresses including the word "sex" has increased tenfoldsince last year. And it's difficult to see how the effectiveness of the Specsfor Kids approach can be diminished by the boom, even in theory.            Volokh's analysis offilters, together with his mandatory-labeling suggestion, also shows a lack ofawareness of the labeling infrastructure that software vendors and the rest ofthe network industry are increasingly accepting as a standard--the Platform forInternet Content Selection. PICS was developed by a cross-industry workinggroup coordinated by the World Wide Web Consortium, and is described in thepaper "PICS: Internet Access Controls Without Censorship," by Paul Resnick andJames Miller. This paper (to appear in Communications of the ACM ) aswell as other material on PICS can be found on the Web.            PICS is a set of conventionsthat describe formats for labeling Internet content and methods for how labelsare distributed. PICS does not dictate what the labels should say or how theyshould be used. To quote Resnick and Miller, PICS is "analogous to specifyingwhere on a package a label should appear, and in what font it should beprinted, without specifying what it should say."            The intent of thisflexibility is to support a wide variety of labeling systems and selectionmethods. For instance, one might configure a Web browser to screen out materialthat carries certain labels. This is the system imagined by Volokh, but it isonly one approach. As an alternative, one might make accessible only those Webpages that are labeled in a particular way, for example, Web pages that carrythe "seal of approval" of various organizations. This second approach,functionally similar to that of Specs for Kids, would address Volokh's concernabout "keeping up" with new Web sites.            And these are only thesimplest applications; PICS was expressly designed to be an open-ended systemthat permits multiple labeling services and multiple ways of using labels;unlike the CDA, PICS can be used for purposes other than screening out sexualor offensive content. In creating a standard for interoperability, the PICSdesigners envisioned the growth of a competitive market in third-party ratingservices, where the pressures of competition will help assure that current andfuture labels are timely and accurate. They also envisioned a competitivemarket in selection software, leading to increasingly sophisticated techniquesfor using those labels. As Resnick and Miller write:                           Aroundthe world, governments are considering restrictions on on-line content. Sincechildren differ, contexts of use differ, and values differ, blanketrestrictions on distribution can never meet everyone's needs. Selectionsoftware can meet diverse needs, by blocking reception, and labels are the rawmaterials for implementing context-specific selection criteria. Theavailability of large quantities of labels will also lead to new sorting,searching, filtering, and organizing tools that help users surf the Internetmore efficiently.                        The free-market evolutionaryapproach may not be perfect, but it is counterintuitive to assume, as Volokhapparently does, that saddling the system with CDA-derived regulations couldmake it more effective or efficient. If anything, such a regulation is likelyto have the opposite effect. Imposing a single, federally approved standard forthe kinds of constitutionally protected content that government can banish frompublic forums in the name of protecting minors seems likelier to skew themarket. It would diminish the ability parents now have to decide for themselveswhich solution is most effective. (And the marketplace of ideas wouldn'texactly be enhanced, either.)            Ironically, those who rely on either Volokh's constitutional "spillover"analysis or his assessment of software filters may feel compelled to craft lawsthat ensure we never escape from the "spillover" problem: laws that needlesslypit adults' First Amendment rights against the state's interest in protectingchildren. That would be a shame, since the technical solutions that Volokhdismisses carry the promise of avoiding his "spillover" problem altogether.Thanks to these inexpensive and highly adaptable tools, two important socialinterests--the protection of children and the preservation of First Amendmentrights--need no longer be viewed as opponents in a zero sum game.            --Mike Godwinstaffcounsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation            --HalAbelsonprofessor of computer science and engineering, Massachusetts Instituteof Technology                           EugeneVolokh replies:                        Godwin and Abelson raise someinteresting legal points. I stand by my legal analysis, which I believe isbased on the most natural reading of the cases; I do not believe I am guilty ofany "basic legal errors" that Godwin and Abelson ascribe to me. I recognize,though, that reasonable minds can differ on the questions involved here, muchas they generally can with regard to most genuinely contested legalquestions.            My brief responses to theirpoints:            1. As I mentioned in myoriginal article, it's true that one of the keycases-- Pacifica --contained language that limited it to the broadcastingmedium. But it seems to me that Sable Communications and the relevantpart (Part III) of Denver Consortium allow the government to restrictspeech in other media, so long as the restriction is the least restrictivemeans of shielding children from improper material. The Internet would, Ithink, be no exception.            2. My article expresslypointed out that the CDA's ban on indecency does indeed apply to more than justpornography. This is one of the things that troubles me about the CDA.            Nonetheless, the SupremeCourt's decision in Denver Consortium seems to me to firmly stand forthe proposition that the government has a compelling interest in shieldingchildren from "indecent" speech: Speech that depicts or describes "sexual orexcretory activities or organs" in "patently offensive terms," whether the speech is pornographic ornot.            3. The court's decisions seemto me to be equally applicable to commercial distributors of indecency andnoncommercial ones. Perhaps the court can ultimately be persuaded to draw adistinction between the two; it would, I think, be an uphill battle, butperhaps a winnable one, and I wish free-speech hawks all the best on it. Ishould note, though, that the recent federal court decision in Shea vs.Reno (released after Godwin and Abelson's letter was written) rejected sucha distinction--whether rightly or wrongly--in the closely related context of avagueness analysis.            4. Whether one looks at arating requirement as a speech compulsion (you must self-rate any indecentspeech) or as a speech restriction (you may not say certain things unless youself-rate them), a rating requirement is indeed a burden on speech; I don'tbelieve I suggested thecontrary. But such a burden might still be upheld if it's the leastrestrictive means of shielding children. I think one can make a considerablystronger case on this score for the constitutionality of the rating requirementthan of the CDA itself. As I mentioned in my original article, I think the CDAwould probably be struck down, but my guess is that some form of self-ratingrequirement would probably be upheld.            5. As to the factual pointsGodwin and Abelson raise, I refer the reader to my response to the letter fromJay Friedland of SurfWatch. In that response, I agree that my discussion ofwhat SurfWatch does was an oversimplification--for which I apologize--butexplain why I believe it doesn't appreciably affect the legal analysis: Theother technological alternatives, in my view, will not constitute the "lessrestrictive alternatives" needed to make the CDA unconstitutional. (Theearlierresponse does not discuss in detail the PICS model, but I believe that thepoints it raises are generally applicable to PICS.)            6. Finally, as a policymatter, I am no fan of the CDA, or even of a rating requirement. My articlefocused on whether the CDA was constitutional, not on whether it was wise.Given the choice, I'd much rather stick with private choice of privatelyadministered screening mechanisms.            The heart of my argument,though, is that none of these alternative mechanisms "carr[ies] the promise ofavoiding [the] spillover problem altogether" (in Godwin's and Abelson's words).They doubtless decrease the problem. As I said in the article, they maydecrease it enough to make the CDA unconstitutional: "The best guess seems tobe that the marginal benefit of the CDA over the technological alternatives issmall enough, and the burden that the law creates is large enough, that the CDAwill be overturned."            But itseems to me that the spillover will always be there, and the court will alwayshave to make the same "hard choice: sacrifice some shielding of children inorder to protect grownups, or sacrifice some access by grownups in order toshield children." Private screening mechanisms may make the choice somewhateasier; but I'm not persuaded that they can eliminate it entirely.
