                                 <EM>MONICA!</EM>            The White House may have been in crisis all year,but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musicalcomedy. Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show!                           The time: November 1995.                                       The HouseRepublicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version ofthe budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicanshave taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'lllet the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meetswith advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretaryBETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.                        "The Shutdown" (upbeatproduction number)                           PANETTA:The Republicans have positions            To which they're clingingfast.                           ICKES: Thepresident is just as firm            The die, it seems, iscast.                           PANETTA:Without a budget passed by Congress            The government willclose.            All of the workers            Will be sent home onfurloughs.                           CLINTON               [speaking]               : Well, wait a second--not all of them.We'll need to keep some essential personnel.                           PANETTA:The Army and the Navy            Will need to stay inplace.                           ICKES:Also those at NASA            Who keep the shuttle up inspace.                           PANETTA:We'll need to keep the pilots            Flying in their planes.                           CLINTON:And here at the White House            My staff should remain.                           PANETTA               [speaking]               : But even here at the White House, someadjustments will be required.                           CLINTON:OK, tell the ushers            To take a few days off.            Tell the maids and cooksand butlers            To go play themselves somegolf.            We have to do without theclerks            Let them all go home.                           CURRIE:What about the secretaries?            Who will get thephones?                           CLINTON               [speaking]               : We've got to make sure the Oval Officefunctions with efficiency. We can't afford the tiniest error.                           PANETTA:Aha! I have it!            We'll bring in anintern,            We'll bring in anintern,            Someone who's an expertwith a phone.            We'll bring in anintern,            We'll bring in anintern,            I assure you, Mr.President--            Your routine here won't getblown.                           PANETTA ,ICKES , and CURRIE                [solemnlyagreeing]               :                        The presence of an internwill ensure            Your routine here won't getblown.                           [The advisers depart, leaving President Clinton alone. He turnsintrospective.]                        "President Lonely" (aballad)                           CLINTON:I've got deputies and bureaucrats            Who fulfill my everythought.            And soldiers, sailors, andMarines            To fight battles I wantfought.            There's no one who's gotmore power,            I'm the leader of allthat's free            But if you subtract theflags and lackeys, I'm just            Lonely.            I'm President Lonely.            But I guess I'll just haveto muddle through.            The cheers and applause areoverwhelming,            But presidents needcuddles, too.            The fawning adoration'spleasant,            But presidents needcuddles, too.                           [Enter BettyCurrie.]                                       CURRIE:Mr. President? The intern is here. And she's brought you some pizza!                           [The lights go down.When they resume, the intern-- MONICA LEWINSKY --is talking onthe phone to her good friend LINDA TRIPP .]                                       LEWINSKY:Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. Sowhen they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said,"Hel-lo-o-o!" And then I had the idea to take him pizza!                           TRIPP: And then what happened?            "What Went On" (upbeat)                           LEWINSKY:Then I led him on.            I showed him my thong,            I let him take a long andling'ring look.            I led him on.            He studied my thong,            Andfrom that point I had the president hooked.            That night when I took thepresident some pizza,            I made sure that he knewthat he could have a piece.            We went into the hallway byhis study            And dispensed withformalities.                           TRIPP: Ohplease go on!            You must go on!            Come on, girlfriend,            Spill, spill, spill, spill,spill!            Now go on,            Please go on.            Did Clinton let you say hito Little Bill?                                        LEWINSKY:His lips and mine locked in a kiss fantastic,            His hands roved freely'neath my blouse,            I reached into thepresidential trousers,            And hegot a phone call from a member of the House.            So I went on,            While he talked on thephone,            I took a position beforehim on my knees,            And I went on.            And he talked on.            Though what the congressmanheard was            "Please, please, please, please, please!"            But then we didn't goon!                           TRIPP: Youdidn't go on?                           LEWINSKY:No, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp.                           TRIPP: Soyou didn't go on?                           LEWINSKY:No, we didn't go on.            He said he wasn't sure if Iwas someone he            Could            Trust.

TRIPP:That's so weird! What did he think? That you'd go blabbin' this to the wholeworld?                           LEWINSKY:I mean--rilly! Hey, what's that clicking?                           TRIPP:It's just my gum.                           LEWINSKY:Oh--OK!                           [Asthe relationship between Clinton and Monica continues, some members of theWhite House staff become worried about the prudence of continuing therelationship with so much potential for scandal. This song is a conversationbetween Betty Currie, who, though worried, still thinks Monica is a goodperson, and the rather stonier EVELYN LIEBERMAN .]                        "Time to Go"                           CURRIE:They go back there,            They're just talking,            I'm sure she has a verythirsty mind.

CURRIE:She brings him            Little presents.            She really is a verythoughtful soul.                           LIEBERMAN:It's not the junk I mind as much            As her up real close andpersonal touch.            I tell ya, it's MissMonica's time to go.

Monica moves to the Pentagon, but the relationshipintermittently continues. Meanwhile, Paula Jones sues the president for sexualharassment, and it seems clear that before long, Clinton will have to testifyunder oath.

My boyfriend is still inoffice            And he might return to meone day.            You think perhaps that hewill not want me            For all the trouble I'vecaused so far,            But he knows I can alwaysmake him happy            With my thong and mycigar.                           CLINTON:The election was held and the people have spoken,            I can't believe what theyhad to say.            The removal threat isover,            Kenneth Starr should goaway.            I tell you, though, it is amystery,            I mean, I'm unfaithful andI lie.            I might be guilty ofobstruction,            Yet my ratings aresky-high.            That must mean I'm a prettygood president,            Though how, I don't think Iknow.            But obviously I'm not Starror Gingrich,            Which may be why they loveme so.            Which may be why they loveme so.                           [Curtain.]
