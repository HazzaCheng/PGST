Office of the General CounselB-271810.2May 7, 1996The Honorable Larry Pressler Chairman The Honorable Ernest F.Hollings Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce, Science,and Transportation United States SenateThe Honorable Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. Chairman The Honorable JohnD. Dingell Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce House ofRepresentativesSubject: Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standard, Model Year1998Pursuant to section 801(a)(2)(A) of title 5, United States Code,this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the NationalHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department ofTransportation, entitled "Light Truck Average Fuel EconomyStandard, Model Year 1998" (RIN 2127-AF16). We received the rule onApril 22, 1996. It was published in the Federal Register as a finalrule on April 3, 1996. 61 Fed. Reg. 14680.Section 32902(a) of title 49, United States Code, requires theSecretary of Transportation to prescribe by regulation, at least 18months in advance of each model year, average fuel economystandards (known as "Corporate Average Fuel Economy" or "CAFE"standards) for non-passenger automobiles manufactured in that modelyear. Under subsections 32902(a) and (f), the standard is to be themaximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretarydecides manufacturers can achieve in that model year taking intoconsideration technological feasibility, economic practicability,the effect of other GovernmentGAO/OGC-96-11 motor vehicle standards on fuel economy, and theneed of the United States to1conserve energy.The light truck CAFE standard for model year 1997 wasestablished at 20.7 miles per gallon (mpg). During the developmentof the CAFE standard for model year 1998, the Department ofTransportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-50 (Nov. 15, 1995), 109 Stat. 436, was enacted. Section330 of the Appropriations Act, 109 Stat. 457, provides:"None of the funds in this Act shall be available to prepare,propose, or promulgate any regulations pursuant to title V of theMotor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (49 U.S.C. 32901, etseq.) prescribing corporate average fuel economy standards forautomobiles, as defined in such title, in any model year thatdiffers from standards promulgated for such automobiles prior tothe enactment of this section."NHTSA interprets section 330 of the Appropriations Act asrequiring it to prescribe the same light truck CAFE standard formodel year 1998 that applies to model year 1997. Accordingly, therule continues the 20.7 mpg standard for 1998.Enclosed is our assessment of NHTSA's compliance with theprocedural steps required by section 801(a)(1)(B)(i) through (iv)of title 5 with respect to the rule. As discussed in the enclosure,NHTSA did not follow many of the steps that ordinarily would applyto the rule, based in part on its interpretation that section 330of the Appropriations Act required it to fix the 1998 standard at20.7 mpg and thereby deprived the agency of any discretion over thestandard. NHTSA's interpretation of section 330, while notnecessarily the only plausible approach, is supported by thelanguage and legislative history of this provision. Nevertheless,we do not view section 330 as exempting the rulemaking from therequirements referred to in 5 U.S.C.  801(a)(1)(B)(i) through(iv), particularly the analysis called for by 49 U.S.C. 32902.If you have any questions about this report, please contactHenry R. Wray, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (202) 512-8581.The official responsible for GAO's1Authority to prescribe fuel economy standards under section32902 has been delegated by the Secretary to the Administrator ofNHTSA.Page 2 GAO/OGC-96-11 evaluation work relating to the Departmentof Transportation is John H.

McFadden General Counsel Department ofTransportationPage 3 GAO/OGC-96-11ENCLOSUREANALYSIS OF NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION 1998LIGHT TRUCK CAFE STANDARD RULE UNDER 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1)(B)(i)-(iv)(i)Cost-benefit analysisOn January 3, 1996, NHTSA published a notice of proposedrulemaking which proposed a 1998 standard of 20.7 mpg. See 61 Fed.Reg. 145. The Supplementary Information accompanying the proposedrule contains a discussion and assessment of the economic impactsof the proposed standard, including its potential costs, benefits,and alternatives. In addition, NHTSA prepared a PreliminaryRegulatory Evaluation of the proposed standard, which was includedin the docket for the rulemaking and contained more detailedanalyses of these and other affects of the proposed standard. Theagency did not prepare a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis inconnection with the final rule "because of the restrictions imposedby Section 330 of the FY 1996 DOT Appropriations Act." 61 Fed. Reg.at 14682.(ii)Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C.  603-605, 607 and 609Section 603: Initial regulatory flexibility analysisThe Supplementary Information accompanying the proposedrulemaking includes a certification, pursuant to section 605(b) oftitle 5, that the proposal would not have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities, thereby exempting theproposed rule from the requirement for an initial regulatoryflexibility analysis. The certification was accompanied by astatement that few, if any, light truck manufacturers subject tothe proposed rule would be classified as small businesses. See 61Fed. Reg. at 155.Section 605(b) states that the certification and statement shallbe provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small BusinessAdministration (SBA). According to Department of Transportationofficials, the certification and statement were not separatelyprovided to the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy. They stated that,in accordance with the Department's practice, publication ofsection 605(b) certifications in the Federal Register is treated asproviding notice to SBA. An SBA official confirmed that someagencies follow this practice, and that SBA has not objected to it.The official indicated, however, that SBA's policy may change sincefuture certifications will need to be justified more specificallyand will be subject to judicial review.Page 1 GAO/OGC-96-11 Section 604: Final regulatory flexibilityanalysisNHTSA did not conduct a final regulatory flexibility analysisunder section 604, nor did it make a section 605(b) certification,in connection with the final rule. The agency viewed such ananalysis as "unnecessary" in light of its lack of discretion withrespect to the rule, but stated that past evaluations indicated fewif any small businesses would be affected. See 61 Fed. Reg. at14682.Section 605: Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessaryanalysisAs noted above, NHTSA invoked the exemption from the initialregulatory flexibility analysis requirement with respect to theproposed rule.Section 607: Preparation of analysisAs noted above, NHTSA did not prepare an initial or finalregulatory flexibility analysis.Section 609: Participation by small entitiesThe requirements of section 609 are inapplicable to this rulesince NHTSA did not determine that it would have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.(iii) Agency actions relevant to sections 202-205 of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C.  1532-1535Since the standard appears to constitute a federal mandateresulting in aggregate annual private sector expenditures of $100million or more, it would be subject to the requirements of section202 of the Act (Statements to Accompany Significant RegulatoryActions). Neither the proposed nor the final rulemaking expresslyrefers to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act or includes thestatements required by section 202. The Supplementary Informationaccompanying the proposed rule does include some of the informationcovered by section 202.The rule also appears subject to section 205 of the Act,relating to consideration of regulatory alternatives. While NHTSAdid not explicitly address section 205, it complied in substancewith the requirements of this section. Potential alternatives wereconsidered and discussed at the proposed rulemaking stage, and thefinal rulemaking describes NHTSA's determination that there was noalternative to the standard adopted.The requirements of section 203 (Small Government Agency Plan)and section 204 (State, Local, and Tribal Government Input) appearto be inapplicable to the rule.Page 2 GAO/OGC-96-11 (iv) Other relevant information orrequirements under Acts and Executive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  551 et seq.The rule was promulgated through the general notice of proposedrulemaking procedures of the Act, 5 U.S.C.  553. NHTSA affordedinterested persons the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule.The final rulemaking, however, does not address comments.Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.  3501-3520The rule does not refer to information collection requirementssubject to the Act, and, according to NHTSA, the rule imposes nosuch requirements.National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C.  4321 et seq.NHTSA did not conduct an evaluation of the impacts of the ruleunder the National Environmental Policy Act. The SupplementaryInformation accompanying the final rule states in this regard:"There is no requirement for such an evaluation where Congresshas eliminated the agency's discretion by precluding any actionother than the one announced in this notice." 61 Fed. Reg. at14682.Statutory authorization for the ruleThe Supplementary Information accompanying the final rulediscusses at length its legal basis. Section 32902(a) of title 49,United States Code, requires that light truck CAFE standards beprescribed for each model year in accordance with the "Maximumfeasible" criteria specified in that subsection and subsection32902(f). However, section 330 of the Appropriations Acteffectively prohibited issuance of any CAFE standard "that differsfrom standards promulgated . . . prior to the enactment of thissection." According to NHTSA's legal analysis detailed in theSupplementary Information, section 330 of the Appropriations Actprecluded the agency from prescribing any CAFE standard differentfrom the most recent standards prescribed at the time of itsenactment--those applicable to model year 1997. Thus, according toNHTSA, section 330 deprived the agency of the discretion itotherwise would have under section 32902 to determine theapplicable standard under the criteria set forth therein. NHTSAconcluded that while section 330 superseded the section 32902criteria, it did not supersede the section 32902 mandate that therebe CAFE standards for model year 1998.NHTSA noted that the only other possible interpretation ofsection 330 was to treat the phrase "standards promulgated . . .prior to the enactment of this section" asPage 3 GAO/OGC-96-11 encompassing any standard prescribed forany prior model year. In addition to the20.7 mpg standard, nine other light truck standards--rangingfrom 17.5 to 21.0 mpg--were promulgated for prior model years.1However, NHTSA rejected this interpretation on the basis that itcould also conflict with the "maximum feasible" criteria under 49U.S.C.  32902, and that it would be illogical to assume thatCongress intended to arbitrarily limit the 1998 standard to one ofthese prior year levels even if some other level was determined tobe the "maximum feasible" for model year 1998.Accordingly, NHTSA concluded that the only legally permissiblealternative was to establish the model year 1998 standard at 20.7mpg. As a result, the agency did not complete its analysis todetermine what the "maximum feasible" level actually would be formodel year 1998 under the 49 U.S.C.  32902 criteria.NHTSA's legal interpretation is supported by the language andlegislative history of section 330. As the analysis points out, theHouse Appropriations Committee report and a floor statement by theprincipal sponsor of section 330--Representative DeLay--describesection 330 as permitting NHTSA to establish a 1998 standard"identical to" the model year 1997 standard. The conference reportdescribes section 330 as prohibiting the use of funds for"regulations that prescribe changes in" the CAFE standards.On the other hand, we question whether NHTSA was compelled bysection 330 to forego completion of the analysis otherwise mandatedby 49 U.S.C.  32902 to determine the "maximum feasible" level formodel year 1998. The legislative history of section 330, taken as awhole, suggests that the fundamental purpose of this provision wasto prevent an anticipated increase in the CAFE standards.Representative DeLay observed in his floor statement that NHTSA wasengaged in a rulemaking "which could result in a sharp increase inthe standards for light trucks and vans" and that "this actionwould be devastating to the Nation's economy." 141 Cong. Rec. H7605(daily ed., July 25, 1995). He also stated that section 330"imposes a 1-year freeze on the ability of NHTSA to increase theCAFE standards" and that "it was my intent that NHTSA wouldwithhold any further action directed toward increasing CAFEstandards . . .." Id. In this context, the references in thehistory to requiring an identical standard or precluding anychanges for 1998 may have been based on the assumption that theoutcome of any change would be an increase in the standard.Completing the analysis under 49 U.S.C.  32902 would haveprovided NHTSA more information on which to assess the relationshipbetween that section and section1These standards are listed in a table included in the finalrule. The 21 mpg standard was initially prescribed for model year1985, but was amended to 19.5 mpg before the start of that modelyearPage 4 GAO/OGC-96-11 330. For example, if the analysis indicatedthat the "maximum feasible" level for 1998 was at or closer to oneof the lower prior year standards than it was to the 1997 standard,prescribing that lower standard would not necessarily beimpermissible. Such an action would give greater effect to 49U.S.C.  32902 than using the 20.7 mpg standard and would satisfythe plain terms of section 330. Nor is it clear that such actionwould conflict with the purpose underlying section 330. The historydoes not explicitly address the possibility that the 20.7 mpgstandard might exceed the "maximum feasible" level for 1998indicated under 49 U.S.C.  32902.Executive Order No. 12866Based on its economic impact, the rule was determined to be a"significant regulatory action" within the meaning of ExecutiveOrder No. 12866. Consistent with the Executive order, the rule wasinitiated through an advance notice of proposed rulemakingpublished on April 6, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 16324. As notedpreviously, the proposed rulemaking published on January 3, 1996,includes a Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation. The final rule,however, does not include a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis.According to NHTSA, the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs reviewed the rule at the proposed and final stages andsuggested no changes.Executive Order 12612The Supplementary Information accompanying the proposed rulestates that, based on an analysis of the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order No. 12612, NHTSA determined that theproposed rule would not have sufficient federalism implications towarrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 61 Fed. Reg. at155. The Supplementary Information accompanying the final rulestates that the final rule was not analyzed under Executive OrderNo. 12612 because of the NHTSA's lack of discretion with respect tothe rule. It adds that prior light truck standards have not beenviewed as having federalism implications warranting preparation ofa Federalism Analysis. 61 Fed. Reg. at 14682.NHTSA did not identify any other statutes or Executive ordersimposing requirements relevant to the rule.Page 5 GAO/OGC-96-11
