                                 The Bell Curve Flattened            Charles Murray is apublicity genius, and the publication of his and Richard Herrnstein's book,The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , inthe fall of 1994 was his masterpiece.            Virtuallyall ambitious trade hardcover books are preceded by an edition of 100 to 200flimsy "galley proofs." These are sent out to people who might generate buzzfor the book: blurbists, bookers for television talk shows, editors, and--mostimportant--book critics. There is an ethos of letting the chips fall where theymay about the sending out of galleys: Now the book will begin to receiveuncontrolled reaction. (For example, back in 1991, Murray somehow got hold ofthe galleys of my own last book, and wrote me heatedly denying that he wasworking on a book about black genetic intellectual inferiority, as I hadasserted. I left the passage in, but softened it.)            The Bell Curve was not circulated in galleys beforepublication. The effect was, first, to increase the allure of the book (Theremust be something really hot in there!), and second, to ensure that no oneinclined to be skeptical would be able to weigh in at the moment ofpublication. The people who had galley proofs were handpicked by Murray and hispublisher. The ordinary routine of neutral reviewers having a month or two togo over the book with care did not occur. Another handpicked group was flown toWashington at the expense of the American Enterprise Institute and given aweekend-long personal briefing on the book's contents by Murray himself(Herrnstein had died very recently), just before publication. The result waswhat you'd expect: The first wave of publicity was either credulous or angry,but short on evidence, because nobody had had time to digest and evaluate thebook carefully.                           The Bell Curve isn't atypical work of trade nonfiction. It is gotten up as a work of originalscholarly research. Most works containing fresh regression analysis andhistorical argument from primary sources would be published in academicquarterlies that send manuscripts out for elaborate, lengthy evaluation beforedeciding whether to publish them. Herrnstein and Murray didn't do this, so itwasn't until a full year or more after The Bell Curve was published thatthe leading experts on its subject had a chance to go through the underlyingdata with care. Therefore, as time went on, the knowledgeability of the BellCurve discussion grew, but the attention paid to that discussion inevitablyshrank.            The debateon publication day was conducted in the mass media by people with noindependent ability to assess the book. Over the next few months, intellectualstook some pretty good shots at it in smaller publications like the NewRepublic and the New York Review of Books . It wasn't until late 1995that the most damaging criticism of The Bell Curve began to appear, intiny academic journals. What follows is a brief summary of that last body ofwork. The Bell Curve , it turns out, is full of mistakes ranging fromsloppy reasoning to mis-citations of sources to outright mathematical errors.Unsurprisingly, all the mistakes are in the direction of supporting theauthors' thesis.            First, a quick prcis of The Bell Curve .IQ tests, according to Murray and Herrnstein, measure an essential humanquality, general intelligence. During the second half of the 20 thcentury, this quality has risen to supreme importance, because society hasbecome increasingly complex. The intelligent have therefore gone through an"invisible migration," from points of origin all over the class system to aconcentration at the top of business, government, and the professions. They arelikely to become ever more dominant and prosperous. The unintelligent arefalling further and further behind. Because intelligence is substantiallyinherited, nothing is likely to reverse this process. Blacks areoverrepresented among the unintelligent. Any efforts government might make toimprove the economic opportunities of poor people, especially poor blackpeople, are likely to fail, because their poverty is so much the result ofinherited low intelligence. About the best that can be done for these people isan effort to create a world of simple, decent, honorable toil for them.            Herrnstein and Murray begin by telling us that the liberal position onIQ--namely, "Intelligence is a bankrupt concept"--has been discredited, andthat "a scholarly consensus has been reached" around their position. Thisconsensus is "beyond significant technical dispute." Thus, by the end of theirintroduction, they have arranged matters so that if intelligence has anymeaning at all, the idiotic liberals stand discredited; and meanwhile,extremely broad claims for intelligence have the cover of "consensus."            The notion that IQ tests are completely useless neverprevailed in liberal academia to nearly the extent that Herrnstein and Murraysay. A more accurate rendering of the liberal position would be that ratherthan a single "general intelligence," there are a handful of crucial--andseparate--mental abilities; that none of these abilities is important enough toobviate the role of family background and education; and that native ability(and economic success independent of native ability) can be enhanced byimproving education, training, and public health. The Bell Curve refersin passing to some of these points, but on the whole it sets up a cartoon-leftposition as its (easy) target. Meanwhile, the psychometricians who dominate thefootnotes of The Bell Curve are John Hunter, Arthur Jensen, Malcolm Ree,and Frank Schmidt. These men are well known within the field as representingits right wing, not a mainstream consensus.            The nextproblem with The Bell Curve 's thesis is in the idea of the rise todominance of the cognitive elite. To the book's initial audience of IvyLeaguers, this idea seemed valid on its face. Everybody knows that the bestuniversities, law firms, hospitals, investment banks, and the State Departmentused to be run by preppies whose main virtue was fortunate birth, and are nowopen to one and all on the basis of merit.            But the larger premise--that intelligent peopleused to be scattered throughout the class structure, and are now concentratedat the top--is almost impossible to prove, simply because the massadministration of mental tests is such a recent phenomenon. High scorers onmental tests do "bunch up" (as Herrnstein and Murray put it) inelite-university student bodies. But this is tautological: Any group selectedon the basis of scores on mental tests will be composed disproportionately ofpeople who score high on mental tests. Proving The Bell Curve 's thesiswould require proving that success increasingly correlates with IQ in areas oflife where mental tests are not the explicit gatekeepers. To see howThe Bell Curve tries and fails to get around these inherent problems,see and .            Havingconditioned its audience to view IQ as all-important, The Bell Curvethen manipulates statistics in a way that makes IQ look bigger, and everythingelse smaller, in determining Americans' life-chances.            The basic tool of statistical social science in general,and of The Bell Curve in particular, is regression analysis, a techniqueused to assign weights to various factors (called "independent variables") indetermining a final outcome (called the "dependent variable"). The originalstatistical work in The Bell Curve consists of regression analyses on adatabase called the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. The authors claim todemonstrate that high IQ is more predictive of economic success than any otherfactor, and that low IQ is more predictive of poverty and social breakdown.Virtually all the early commentators on The Bell Curve were unable toassess the merits of the regression analysis. "I am not a scientist. I knownothing about psychometrics," wrote Leon Wieseltier (who was otherwise quitecritical) in a typical disclaimer.            But by now the statisticshave been gone over by professionals, who have come up with different results.The key points of their critique of The Bell Curve are as follows:            What Herrnstein and Murrayused to measure IQ is actually a measure of education as well as intelligence.All the people tracked in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth took theArmed Forces Qualifying Test, which Herrnstein and Murray treat as a goodmeasure of intelligence. Because the material covered in the test includessubjects like trigonometry, many academic critics of The Bell Curve haveobjected to its use as a measure only of IQ and not at all of academicachievement. Herrnstein and Murray concede in the footnotes that scores tend torise with the subjects' education--but they seriously underestimate themagnitude of this rise, as shows. And they resist the obvious inference thatthe test scores are measuring something other than intelligence.            Most of The BellCurve 's analysis is devoted to proving that IQ has more predictive powerthan parental "socio-economic status." But Herrnstein and Murray's method offiguring socioeconomic status seems designed to low-ball its influence, asexplains.            Herrnstein and Murray begintheir discussion of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth data by announcingthat they aren't going to analyze the effect of education, because education istoo much a result of IQ. It's not an independent variable. (Of course,according to their theory, socioeconomic status is also a result of IQ, butsomehow, that doesn't stop them.) Therefore, what you'd most want to know froma policy standpoint--how much education can increase opportunity--isn't dealtwith in the book, except in two obscure footnotes. Both would seem to supportthe liberal, pro-education position that Herrnstein and Murray say is futile.One footnote shows education increasing IQ year by year. The other shows ahigher correlation between college degree and family income than between IQ andfamily income.            One of The BellCurve 's theoretical linchpins is the high heritability of IQ. Herrnsteinand Murray, sounding like the souls of caution, write that "half a century ofwork, now amounting to hundreds of empirical and theoretical studies, permits abroad conclusion that the genetic component of IQ is unlikely to be smallerthan 40 per cent or higher than 80 per cent. ... For purposes of thisdiscussion, we will adopt a middling estimate of 60 per cent heritability."This now looks seriously overstated. Michael Daniels, Bernie Devlin, andKathryn Roeder of Carnegie Mellon University took the same studies on whichHerrnstein and Murray based their estimate, and subjected them to a computermeta-analysis ("a powerful method of statistical analysis"-- The BellCurve ). Their paper, which has not yet been published, says: "In brief,studies of IQ, and our reanalyses of them, suggest a narrow-sense heritabilityof 34 per cent and a broad-sense heritability of 46 per cent. [The differencebetween broad and narrow is too technical to explain in this limited space.]This is a far cry from Herrnstein and Murray's maximum value of 80 per cent ortheir middling value of 60 per cent. Consequently, Herrnstein and Murray givethe impression that IQ is highly 'heritable,' but it is not."            If the purpose of the wholeexercise is to figure out what our social policies should be, then, "Which ismore predictive, IQ or socioeconomic status?" isn't the essential questionanyway. Making it the essential question avoids the issue of whether IQ isreally so massively predictive that it drowns out everything else. (Herrnsteinand Murray mostly leave the evidence for this, their central contention, tofootnotes. The figures they offer are far from dispositive.)            Thechapter of The Bell Curve on policies that might be able to overcome thefate of a low IQ focuses mainly on whether early-childhood programs like HeadStart (most of which aren't run with raising IQ as their primary goal) canraise IQ significantly over the long term, and sorrowfully concludes that theycan't. What the book doesn't discuss is whether public schools--by far thebiggest government social program--can raise IQ, or earnings after you controlfor IQ. As James Heckman of the University of Chicago wrote in the Journalof Political Economy , " Evidence of a genetic component to skills has nobearing on the efficacy of any social policy. ... The relevant issue is thecost effectiveness of the intervention." (As an example of where the kind ofanalysis Herrnstein and Murray didn't do can lead, a new study by Jay Girottoand Paul Peterson of Harvard shows that students who raise their grades andtake harder courses can increase their IQ scores by an average of eight pointsduring the first three years of high school.)            At the beginning of The Bell Curve ,Herrnstein and Murray declare that "the concept of intelligence has taken on amuch higher place in the pantheon of human virtues than it deserves." And theyclaim that their view of IQ tests is "squarely in the middle of the scientificroad." They end by expressing the hope that we can "be a society that makesgood on the fundamental promise of the American tradition: the opportunity foreveryone, not just the lucky ones, to live a satisfying life." Throughout,Herrnstein and Murray consistently present themselves as fair- (or evenliberal-) minded technicians who have, with great caution, followed theevidence where it leads--which, unfortunately, is to a few unassailable ifunpleasant scientific truths that it is their reluctant duty to report.            In fact, The BellCurve is a relentless brief for the conservative position in psychometricsand social policy. For all its talk of reflecting a consensus, the sources itdraws upon are heavily skewed to the right. Herrnstein and Murray usedquasi-nutty studies that support their position (as Charles Lane demonstratedin the New York Review of Books ), and ignore mainstream studies thatcontradict it (as Richard Nisbett showed in the New Republic ). The datain The Bell Curve are consistently massaged to produce conservativeconclusions; not once is a finding that contradicts the main thesis reported inthe text. ( shows how Herrnstein and Murray have made the convergence inblack-white IQ scores, which they claim to find "encouraging," look smallerthan it actually is.) The Bell Curve 's air of strict scientism doesn'tpreclude the use of lightly sourced or unsourced assertions, such as thestatement that the median IQ of all black Africans is 75, or that"intermarriage among people in the top few percentiles of intelligence may beincreasing far more rapidly than suspected" (no footnote). Though they piouslyclaim not to be doing so, Herrnstein and Murray leave readers with the distinctimpression that IQ is the cause of economic success and failure, and thatgenetic difference explains the black-white IQ gap.            In themost famous passage in The Republic , Plato describes an underground cavewhere people are held prisoner in chains, unable to see anything but theshadows cast by figures passing outside; they mistake the shadows for reality.The Republic is probably the first place in history where an idea likethat of Murray and Herrnstein's cognitive elite appears. Plato believed thatthrough education, people could leave the cave and be able to see the truthinstead of the shadows, thus fitting themselves to become the wise rulers ofsociety. But he was quick to insert a cautionary note: Those who have left thecave might be tempted to think they can see perfectly clearly, while actuallythey would be "dazzled by excess of light." The image applies to The BellCurve : Presented as an exact representation of reality, in opposition tothe shadows of political correctness, it actually reflects the blinkered visionof one part of the American elite. It constantly tells these people that theyare naturally superior, and offers lurid descriptions of aspects of nationallife that they know about only by rumor. Readers who accept The BellCurve as tough-minded and realistic, and who assume that all criticism ofit is ignorant and ideologically motivated, are not as far removed from Plato'scave as they might think.            : DumbCollege Students            : SmartRich People            : Educationand IQ            :Socioeconomic Status            : Black-WhiteConvergence
