                                 Pointillism            Independent Counsel KennethStarr's obstruction of justice case against President Clinton is likely to turnon his identification of the author of the so-called "Talking Points." LikeShakespeare's works and the Bible, the TP, a three-page document, has inspirednumerous schools of thought that disagree on the meaning of seemingly banalphrases and discern the handiwork of different authors. As a service toscholars in the burgeoning field of TP Studies--as well as to the generalpublic--here is a Talmudic exegesis, a Reader's Guide to the TP .                           Background: Only oneperson claims to have firsthand knowledge of the TP's origins: Linda Tripp.Tripp told Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff that Monica Lewinsky hadgiven her the TP on Jan. 14, 1998, while driving Tripp home from work. Thatnight, Tripp handed the document over to Starr's office. The following day,wearing an FBI-supplied wire, she met Lewinsky at the Pentagon City, Va.,Ritz-Carlton. FBI agents interrupted their conversation and took Lewinsky to aroom in the hotel for questioning.            The TPadvises Tripp on crafting an affidavit that would recant statements she hadmade to Newsweek 's Isikoff. Tripp told Isikoff last summer that she hadbumped into Kathleen Willey after she left the Oval Office Nov. 29, 1993, andthat Willey had looked flushed, lipstickless, and happy. Three days beforeTripp received the TP, Willey gave sworn testimony in the Paula Jones case thatthe president had fondled her breasts and placed her hand on his crotch. Tripphad been scheduled to be deposed in the Jones case in December, but thedeposition was postponed.                           Whodunit? There are seven theories about the authorship of the TP. Theleading suspects: Lewinsky, Tripp, her ex-lawyer Kirby Behre, Clinton, BruceLindsey (the president's closest aide), the Right-Wing Conspiracy, and acollaboration among several of the above. Click here for a summaryof the major theories.            The TPappears to have been composed in three parts, each in a different voice. Thefirst section, in which Tripp receives legal-sounding advice, is smoothly andefficiently written. The document then shifts from the substance of theaffidavit to the strategy behind it, with special reference to Tripp'srelationship with the president's lawyer Robert Bennett. The final portionrecasts the original section in the first person. It also includes a chattyparagraph discrediting allegations about Lewinsky's alleged affair withClinton.

Pointsto Make in an Affidavit                        Your first few paragraphsshould be about yourself--what you do now, what you did at the White House, andfor how many years you were there as a career person and as a politicalappointee.            You and Kathleen werefriends. At around the time of her husband's death (The President has claimedit was after her husband died. Do you reallywant to contradict him?), she cameto you after she allegedly came out ofthe oval and looked (however shelooked), you don't recall her exact words, but she claimed at the time(whatever she claimed) and was very happy.            You did not see her go in orsee her come out.            Talk about when you becameout of touch with her and maybe why.            The next you heard of herwas when a Newsweek reporter (I wouldn't name him specifically) showed up inyour office saying she was naming you as someone who would corroborate that shewas sexually harassed. You spoke with her that evening, etc., and she relayedto you a sequence of events that was very dissimilar from what you rememberedhappening. As a result of your conversation with her and subsequent reportsthat showed that she had tried to enlist the help of someone else in her liethat the President sexually harassed her, you now do not believe that what sheclaimed happened really happened. You now find it completely plausiblethat she herself smeared her lipstick, untucked her blouse, etc.            You never saw her go intothe ovaloffice, or come out of the oval office.            You are not sure you've beenclear about whose side you're on. (Kirbyhas been saying you should look neutral;better for credibility but you aren't neutral. Neutral makes you look likeyou're on the other team since you are a political appointee)            It's important to youthat they think you're a team player, after all, you are a politicalappointee. You believe that they think you're on the other side because youwouldn't meet with them.            You want to meet with Bennett. You are upset about the comment he made, butyou'll take the high road and do what's in your best interest.            December 18th, you were ina better position to attend an all day or half-day deposition, but now you areinto JCOC mode. Your livelihood is dependent on the success of this program.Therefore, you want to provide an affidavit laying out allof the facts in lieu of a deposition.            You want Bennett's people tosee your affidavit before it's signed.            Your deposition should include enough information to satisfy their questioning.            By the way, remember how Isaid there was someone else that I knewabout. Well, she turned out to bea huge liar. I found out she left the WH because she was stalking theP or something like that. Well, at least that gets me out of anotherscandal I know about.            The first few paragraphsshould be about me--what I do now, what I did at the White House and for howmany years I was there as a career person and as a political appointee.            Kathleen and I were friends.At around the time of her husband's death, she came to me after she allegedlycame out of the oval office and looked_____, I don't recall her exact words, butshe claimed at the time ______ and was very happy.            I did not see her go in orsee her come out.            Talk about when I became outof touch with her and maybe why.            The next time I heard of herwas when a Newsweek reporter showed up in my office saying she was naming me asa someone who would corroborate that she was sexually harassed by thePresident. I spoke with her that evening, etc., and she relayed to me asequence of events that was very dissimilar from what I remembered happening.As a result of my conversation with her and subsequent reports that showed shehad tried to enlist the help of someone else in her lie that the Presidentsexually harassed her, I now do not believe that what she claimed happenedreally happened. I now find it completely plausible that she herself smearedher lipstick, untucked her blouse, etc.            I never saw her go into theoval office, or come out of the oval office.            I have never observed the President behave inappropriately with anybody.                                                     Note 1                        Here areseven good guesses about the authorship of the TP:                           1)Lewinsky, the Lone Gunman. Panic-stricken by Tripp's threat that she wouldexpose Lewinsky's affair with Clinton if asked about it in a deposition,Lewinsky mustered all her intellectual resources to cobble together the TP.Lewinsky's former lawyer, William Ginsburg, never denied his client'sinvolvement in the document's preparation. Strikes against this theory: a)Lewinsky doesn't have enough knowledge of the law. b) Apparently, she is notthe sharpest tool in the shed. Tripp has said she immediately suspected the TPwas too deftly crafted to have originated with Lewinsky. c) Lewinsky was toopanic-stricken to have acted this rationally. Before Christmas, for example,the tapes record her suggesting that Tripp have a "foot accident" and behospitalized during the time her deposition was scheduled to take place.                           2)Tripp, the Manipulative Bitch. Gunning to bring down the president afterBennett denounced her, Tripp entrapped Lewinsky. One scenario has her proddingthe gullible young woman to write the TP so she, Tripp, could get physicalevidence of obstruction of justice. Another has her drafting a chunk of theTP--or even the entire thing--herself. A senior White House official has evensuggested a draft of the TP lives on the hard drive of Tripp's computer. Thetheory's defects: a) Why would Tripp risk getting caught fabricating evidencewhen she has mountains of damning tapes and e-mail? b) While the tapes exposeTripp as a horrible friend and a vicious schemer, we have no evidence that sheis capable of conceiving of such a complicated machination.                           3) TheRight-Wing Conspiracy. An elaboration of the Tripp theory. Without anyspecific evidence, proponents of this theory posit that Tripp drafted the TPwith the assistance of lawyers involved in the Jones case or otherwisecommitted to conservative causes.                           4)Behre, the White House Mole. When Tripp testified before Congress aboutTravelgate and Foster's death, the White House helped her retain Behre. Shefired him three days before the TP surfaced, when he asked her to hand thetapes over to Bennett. Behre has the knowledge and the motive (he's loyal tothe White House) to write the TP. (Some implicate Behre's replacement, JamesMoody. It seems unlikely, however, that Moody, a conservative stalwart, wouldhave helped Tripp prepare talking points apparently so favorable to thepresident.) And while the document presents legal-sounding advice, it's toorambling, repetitive, and error-ridden to have been written out by a lawyerworth his salt (though it might be notes based on a lawyer's advice). Inaddition, lawyers know better than to give a witness written instructions aboutthe preparation of false testimony. Note, however, that, as one observerargues, if the TP is entirely true (Willey did muss her own clothes, etc.),assisting in its preparation would not be unethical or tantamount tosubornation of perjury--though it would then be most unlikely that the TP wasprepared by Moody or a right-wing cabal.                           5)Clinton, the Dictator. A lawyer by training, Clinton spent much time on thephone with Lewinsky. He could have dictated points during his calls, and he hasa clear interest in changing Tripp's testimony. But in crises such as this one,Clinton has historically turned to proxies for his dirty work. Moreover the TPis wrong about what Clinton said in his Jones deposition about when his meetingwith Willey took place.                           6)Lindsey, the Fixer. Immediately following the TP's release, reportersfingered the president's confidant as a suspect. He was the administration'spoint man on the Jones case and has been known to wipe up after Clinton's bimboeruptions. And he had reason to believe he could change or blunt the impact ofTripp's testimony. In August, Tripp told Newsweek she doubted Clinton'sadvances to Willey constituted sexual harassment, as Willey--despite her laterprotestations--had not seemed upset at the time. Tripp also contacted Lindseylast summer to discuss the Willey affair. Tripp and Lindsey spoke on at leasttwo more occasions, according to the New York Times . However, there isno evidence that Lewinsky and Lindsey knew each other or ever communicated.                           7) ACombo of the Above. While there is no credible scenario in which the peoplementioned above could have concocted the TP on their own, several of thesuspects could have worked in concert. For instance, it is plausible Tripp andLewinsky collaborated on the TP with insight from a trained lawyer (Clinton,Lindsey, Behre). As our annotation of the text shows, the TP appears to be thehandiwork of multiple authors.                           Back to story.                           Note 2                        Onescenario has the president dictating points over the phone to Lewinsky, withwhom he spent much time talking. A lawyer by training, Clinton has a clearinterest in changing Tripp's testimony. But the author of the TP seemsunfamiliar with Clinton's actual testimony in the Paula Jones case, in which hesaid Willey's visit occurred before her husband's suicide. Thiscontradiction might exculpate Clinton.            But it doesnot necessarily clear aide Lindsey or others close to the president. After all,the president's sealed, private testimony contradicts his lawyer Bennett'spublic pronouncements that the encounter with Willey took place afterher husband's suicide.                           Back to story.                           Note 3                        Accordingto Howard Kurtz's book Spin Cycle , this characterization of the OvalOffice is common only among White House staffers.            And itseems possible that a White House staffer wrote a chunk of the TP. Immediatelyfollowing the TP's release, reporters fingered Lindsey as the leading suspect.Many speculate that he wipes up after the president's bimbo eruptions; he wasalso the administration's point man on the Jones case. Lindsey also had reasonto believe he could change Tripp's testimony. Last summer, Tripp contactedLindsey to discuss the Willey affair (she told Newsweek that becauseWilley didn't seem upset at the time, she didn't think Willey had been sexuallyharassed). Tripp and Lindsey spoke at least two more times, according to theNew York Times . However, there is no evidence that Lewinsky and Lindseyknew each other or ever communicated.                           Back to story.                           Note 4                        Theparenthetical phrasing is emblematic of the tight construction of the firsthalf of the TP. Some theorists have pointed to it as evidence that a lawyerdrafted--or at least advised on the drafting of--the document. Fabricatingevidence would, of course, be a highly unethical activity for a lawyer, but if,as some administration advocates maintain, the TP is all true, assistance inits drafting would not be unethical. However, as noted later, the TP makeslegal errors, and the smooth phrasing could as easily be that of a PR person,journalist, or nonpracticing lawyer. Nonetheless, it casts doubt on the theorythat Lewinsky was the lone author. Tripp told Newsweek she suspectedimmediately that the TP was too deftly crafted to have originated withLewinsky. Lewinsky's former lawyer Ginsburg never denied his client'sinvolvement in the document's preparation (his theory is that it was acollaborative effort).                           Back to story.                           Note 5                        Why doesn'tthe author want to mention Isikoff, the reporter in question? Only Tripp had aclear interest in not seeming unduly familiar with him. For months, she hadbeen meeting clandestinely with Isikoff, discussing her conversations withLewinsky. Tripp had hoped to remain anonymous in Isikoff's story. There's nogood reason why Lindsey should have inserted this detail.            Aside fromthis sentence, there is no specific hint that Tripp penned the TP to entrapLewinsky. However, Tripp had a motive: She wanted to take down the presidentafter Bennett, his lawyer, denounced her. One scenario has Tripp--with theassistance of lawyers involved in the Jones case or otherwise committed toconservative causes--prodding the gullible Lewinsky to write the TP so she,Tripp, would have clear evidence of attempted obstruction of justice. Anotherhas Tripp drafting a chunk of the TP--or even the whole thing--herself. Asenior administration official has suggested that a draft of the TP lives onTripp's hard drive. The defect with these theories: Why would Tripp riskgetting caught fabricating evidence when she has mountains of damning tapes ande-mail?                           Back to story.                           Note 7                        "Someoneelse" apparently refers to Julie Steele, a friend of Willey's. Steele initiallytold Newsweek that Willey had confided the details of the incident withClinton to her shortly after it happened. Later, Steele changed her story,saying Willey had told her that the president had "made a pass" at her onlyweeks after the alleged incident and that she had lied at Willey's behest.                           Back to story.                           Note 8                        On itsface, the suggestion seems highly unlikely: that Willey, who had gone inseeking a job from the president, would leave the Oval Office and stop to mussherself, hoping to run into someone who could later confirm a false allegationof sexual advances by Clinton. However, by this time, Steele had changed herstory, saying Willey had asked her to lie about exactly when Willey hadconfided in her and also about the details of the alleged sexual encounter. Thesuggestion in the TP would be consistent with the amended Steele statements.The TP also says Willey's blouse was untucked--a point that has been cited asevidence Willey was lying, since an untucked blouse would probably have beennoticed by the other people waiting in the reception area outside the OvalOffice. However, Tripp is quoted in Newsweek as observing only thatWilley was "disheveled. Her face was red and her lipstick was off." So theadded detail in the TP may have been intended to further discredit Willey.                           Back to story.                           Note 9                        At thisjuncture, it seems another author takes over. Note the "the oval" is nowreferred to as the "oval office." Also, this sentence essentially repeats theadvice already given: "You did not see her go in or see her come out." The TP'stenor and tone shift from legalistic to colloquial.                           Back to story.                           Note 10                        The authoris obviously on the side he or she thinks Tripp would do well to be on. Assubsequent sentences make clear, that side is the administration's--as distinctfrom Jones'.                           Back to story.                           Note 11                        When Tripptestified before Congress about Travelgate and Vince Foster's death, the WhiteHouse helped her retain lawyer Kirby Behre. She fired Behre three days beforeshe gave the TP to Starr, when, she says, Behre asked her to hand the tapesover to Bennett. Behre has the knowledge and the motive (he's loyal to theWhite House) to have written the TP.            The writeris familiar with what Behre has been telling Tripp and calls him by his firstname, which might suggest Tripp (or perhaps Lewinsky, who has been discussingTripp's legal strategy with her) is the author. However, New YorkObserver columnist Philip Weiss says presidential adviser andtroubleshooter Lindsey also commonly refers to everyone but the president by afirst name. However, Behre denies having talked with Lindsey.                           Back to story.                           Note 12                        This isclumsily phrased: The identity of the "other side" is ambiguous. It sounds morelike loose drafting by a PR person than it does the work of a practicinglawyer.                           Back to story.                           Note 13                        The NewYork Times and others, quoting "lawyers connected to the case," reportLindsey had earlier advised Tripp to seek Bennett's help, advice Trippeschewed.                           Back to story.                           Note 14                        Bennett wasquoted as saying that "Linda Tripp is not to be believed" in the Willeycontroversy.                           Back to story.                           Note 15                        The datewhen Tripp was originally scheduled to be deposed by Jones' lawyers.                           Back to story.                           Note 16                        This is theacronym for the Joint Civilian Orientation Course, a program Tripp ran at thePentagon. Lewinsky, as well as Tripp, would be familiar with the acronym, aswould people in the White House who knew where Tripp had been placed followingher transfer.                           Back to story.                           Note 17                        Presumably,only someone with legal training--though not necessarily a practicinglawyer--would know that an affidavit could substitute for a deposition.However, this is not good lawyerly advice. It is unlikely that Jones' lawyerswould have accepted an affidavit in lieu of a deposition from someone who hadchanged her story.                           Back to story.                           Note 18                        The writermeans "affidavit," since the stated point of this exercise is to enable Trippto avoid being deposed in person. This is not a mistake that a practicinglawyer would make, though it could be a mistake made in dictation.                           Back to story.                           Note 19                        Theremainder of the document is cast in the first rather than the second person.And, in this paragraph--though not in the following ones--the tone becomes morechatty. This might suggest that Tripp herself is writing the TP in her ownwords. However, if Tripp were creating a bogus document for purposes ofentrapment, it would not seem in her interest to recast second-personparagraphs from earlier in the document in such a way that they are potentiallyconfusing.                           Back to story.                           Note 20                        Thisapparent reference to Lewinsky is the only substantive addition to the secondpart of the document. It seems unlikely that Lewinsky would refer to herself asa "big liar" who was "stalking" the president. However, Lewinsky had recentlygiven sworn testimony in the Jones case that flatly contradicted her lengthytaped conversations with Tripp, in which she had talked about her affair withClinton. So it is possible that she decided it was better to label herself aliar in this context than to face perjury charges. The word "huge," whichappears here, is used by Tripp three times in the transcript of her tapedconversations with Lewinsky reported in Newsweek . This point is made bySkip Fox and Jack Gillis, two academics at the University of SouthwesternLouisiana whose analysis of the TP may be found here.                           Back to story.            Note 21            Narcissistic phrasing that allegedly sounds very much like Lewinsky.                           Back to story.                           Note 22                        No effortis made to fill in the blanks. This suggests Tripp is not attempting toconstruct a first draft in her own words following the earlierinstructions.                           Back to story.                           Note 23                        In theWashington Post version of the TP--given here--a second-person versionof this sentence does not appear in the first section of the document. In ABC'sversion of the document, it appears in both places. Both the Post andABC claim to have copies of the original TP. In itself, the discrepancy has noapparent significance, although it has been pointed to by theorists who contendthat the TP was leaked through more than one source.
