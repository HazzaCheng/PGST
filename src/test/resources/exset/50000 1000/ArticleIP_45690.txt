                                 Insiders and Way Insiders                                             Being JohnMalkovich                is everything I've ever dreamed of in a crazy comedy. It'sclose to pure farce, yet its laughs are grounded in loneliness, impotence,self-loathing, and that most discomfiting of vices to dramatize: envy. Theaction is surreal, the emotions are violently real. The screenwriter, CharlieKaufman, is a genius at finding slapstick correlatives for people's nebuloussense--or non-sense--of themselves. It's possible that no one has ever come upwith a more absurdly perfect metaphor for our longing to besomeone--anyone--other than who we are than a portal into the head of JohnMalkovich.            Kaufman's protagonist,Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), is a soulfully unkempt puppeteer whose wildlyambitious work is ignored while his gimmicky rivals thrive. When he reports fora drudge job as a file clerk, the office is between the seventh and eighthfloors of a Manhattan skyscraper--it's the seven-and-a-halfth floor, wherepeople walk stooped and make feeble jokes about the "low overhead." That lowceiling--a constant reminder of how Craig has been stunted--is the first signof the movie's comic astuteness, of its knack for devising sight gags with asting. When a sleek and derisive colleague named Maxine (Catherine Keener)rebuffs his advances and mocks his art, Craig argues passionately on behalf ofhis puppets: He says that everyone longs to be inside someone else's head. Oncue, he discovers a passageway behind a file cabinet that whooshes him into thehead of Malkovich and then disgorges him, after 20 minutes, into a ditch besidethe New Jersey Turnpike. The poor sap can't keep his secret. He tells the girl,who is soon selling tickets to the Malkovich experience. The biggest Malkovichaddict turns out to be Craig's nerdily frazzled wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), whosums up the thrill for the rest of the characters. "Being inside did somethingto me," she says. "I knew who I was."            The director, Spike Jonze (he played the skinny redneck inThree Kings ), comes to Being                John Malkovich from musicvideos, but the movie isn't a digitized bag of tricks like Fight               Club . Jonze is never in your face: His instincts must have told him thathyping gags this outlandish would turn the picture into camp. He keeps theaction slightly remote and the jokes deadpan, and the upshot is that theaudience almost never stops giggling. The first hour and change has a magicalfluidity. The scenes between Cusack and Keener boast the best emasculatingbanter since Christopher Durang's Beyond Therapy , and when Lotte andMaxine begin to communicate erotically through Malkovich's body, the filmbecomes a transsexual (and transcendental) screwball comedy. The script has afree-association quality that turns audiences on--they love not knowing wherethey're going. I wonder if Kaufman, when he started writing, even knew that theprotagonist would stumble on that portal, or what he'd find when he wentthrough. (The head of John Malkovich??!!??)            That the vessel isMalkovich might be the movie's most brilliantly unsettling touch, since theactor--although undeniably great--is one of our most distant and weirdlyinsular. You can understand the masses fantasizing about being Bruce Willis orbeing Tom Hanks, but being John Malkovich? What's lodged under that thick browis anybody's guess. Evidently quite the heterosexual, he still courts sexualambiguity: He speaks in querulous tones and bats the most insolently femininelashes this side of Bugs Bunny. Weird or not, though, he's a celebrity: Heexists. And Malkovich makes a wonderful Malkovich. The actor sends up his ownpreening aloofness, and he has never been more emotionally exposed than when itdawns on him that his smug faade has been literally penetrated. When heattempts to fathom what's happening to him, Jonze and Kaufman deliver a coupde cinema --a vision of hell that isn't,  la Sartre, other people, butoneself ad infinitum.            B eing John Malkovich should have ended right there,since the filmmakers never top that hysterical sequence. Kaufman seems to havewritten himself into a corner. In the last half-hour he ties things up tooneatly and the craziness--and some of the helium--goes out of the movie. Why docrazy comedies need closure? As Cusack's character becomes more twisted, heloses his stature (and the audience's good will), and the climax has too manydissonances. Kaufman and Jonze end up sentimentalizing the longing for acollective consciousness in a way I found creepy: Do they mean to be retellingInvasion of the Body Snatchers from the body-snatchers' point of view?(If so, the film is even darker than I think it is.)            The last part diminishesthe movie, but not enough to wreck it: It's still an amazing piece of work.What other madcap farce would dare to have a score--it's by the superb CarterBurwell--so plangent and melancholy? Or to cast that sunny goddess Cameron Diazas a nerd? The actress retains her essential sweetness, but the transformationis otherwise remarkable: Her Lotte is such a mouth breather that she nearlydrools, and Diaz manages to look estranged from that lovely body. Even moredazzling is Keener, an actress who has lately been stuck playing nice, sensiblewomen but who here is all silken curves and withering putdowns--she greetsCraig's declaration of love with a pitying sigh that brings the house down.Keener's Maxine is so glamorously, tantalizingly self-contained that you canalmost believe she never dreams of being John Malkovich.            T                  he Insider                is a big, overlong, and ratherunwieldy piece of storytelling, but the story it has to tell is so vital thatit cuts through all the dramaturgical muddiness. It's a terrific muckrakingmelodrama--it will get people fuming. It's about big-business mendacity and thelawyers who do its bidding, and about what happens to corporate whistle-blowersin a society where the mainstream media are also in the hands of corporations.The movie tells two interlocking stories: The first is about Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe), former vice president for research and development at theBrown & Williamson tobacco company, who is persuaded to go public withrevelations about how cigarette manufacturers manipulate the chemicals in theirproduct for maximum addictiveness. (Despite their testimonies in Congress,Wigand says, tobacco executives regard cigarettes as "a nicotine deliverysystem.") The second story concerns the 60 Minutes producer LowellBergman (Al Pacino), the man who persuaded Wigand to come forward. Bergmanwatches in horror as his network, CBS, backs away from the story under pressurefrom the corporate wing--which fears, at a time when CBS is on the block, theimpact of a major lawsuit on its value. (Oddly unmentioned in the film is thatthen-owner Lawrence Tisch had his own tobacco company, Lorillard, and hadseparate dealings with Brown & Williamson.)            We're used to hearingtales of witnesses, informants, or whistle-blowers who are urged to comeforward and then, after they do, are "hung out to dry"--i.e., left unprotectedby the agents who approached and exploited them. What gives this version itskick--and what has made it fodder for columnists for almost six months--is thatthe people who betray the whistle-blower are among the most famous and powerfuljournalists in America: Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt, the co-anchor and theexecutive producer of 60 Minutes . If they could be pressured to "spike"a segment that they knew to be true, the film implicitly asks, how much chancedo others have of breaking stories about corporate wrongdoing? And what aboutnews personnel with a financial stake in their companies? Even journalists andeditors known for their integrity tend to look the other way at their owncompanies' malfeasances when they hear words like "stock options" and"IPO."            But the movie's emotional hook isn't the CBS infighting orBergman's quest to get the story. It's the fate of Wigand, played by Crowe as aprickly, blockish fellow with no social skills--an edgy wonk. Already isolatedby temperament, he seems more vulnerable than a conventionally nice martyr.Wigand appears to have no friends, and his wife (a nearly unrecognizable DianeVenora), a Southern debutante type who clearly didn't bargain for a life ofsocial and financial ostracization, is on the verge of bailing out on him evenbefore the bullets start appearing in the family's mailbox and the deaththreats on Wigand's computer. You can't always tell what Crowe is doing--hisopacity is sometimes a little too opaque. What's plain, though, is that Wiganddoesn't want to have this role, didn't ask for it, and has no support system toget him through it. He's entirely dependent on Bergman, with whom he mostlycommunicates by cell phone and fax.            The director, MichaelMann, has never tried to tell a story as complex (or nonviolent) as TheInsider , and he and his co-screenwriter, Eric Roth, don't shape theirnarrative very satisfyingly. Wigand and Bergman are both "insiders," and both,ultimately, whistle-blowers. (It was Bergman's spilling his guts to the NewYork Times that finally shamed CBS into running the Wigand interview.) Butalthough the 60 Minutes producer is played by the star (Pacinograndstands, but not to the point of distraction), Bergman's story doesn't havethe same primal force. Wigand's dark night of the soul is in a hotel, indicted,financially ruined, threatened with death, minus his wife and daughters;Bergman's is in an expensive-looking beach house with his warmly supportivespouse (Lindsay Crouse).            The filmmakers seem to be bending over backward--evennow--to protect Wigand from appearing to have disclosed what he disclosed tooearly. I admire their consideration for their subject, but in its wake come allkinds of narrative fuzziness. The movie isn't clear on where the secret reportthat kicked off Bergman's interest in tobacco came from, or who in the FDAthought it was a good idea to turn him onto Wigand. It's left vague just whenBergman decided that Wigand was important not for what he might say about thatreport but about the industry as a whole. Mann must have had legal constraintsthat rivaled those at 60 Minutes . The FBI, which responds to a deaththreat, carries off Wigand's computer while he sputters that it contains allhis important data. The implication is that the local FBI office is in cahootswith Brown & Williamson, but we hear no more about it; we never even knowif Wigand got his computer back. And there's no dramatic payoff with thechillingly satanic tobacco company president (Michael Gambon) whose threatsfirst make Wigand think about going public. Given how many lawyers must havevetted this thing, it's probably an achievement that Mann got as much as he didon the screen.            Should Mike Wallace be pissed off? Depends whatreally happened. In a delicious turn, Christopher Plummer makes the co-anchorless a journalist than a pompous prima donna, but he also gives him a bullyingforce and real charisma. It's not Wallace's initial caving-in to thenetwork--"I'm with Don on this," he tells Bergman--that does him the mostdamage. It's the scene in a posh restaurant in which Wallace regards theWigands' paroxysms of fear over the coming 60 Minutes interview witharistocratic contempt. He says, "Who are these people?"--which opens thedoor for Bergman's too-pat rebuke: "Ordinary people under extraordinarycircumstances, Mike. What do you expect? Grace and consistency?" It's Wallace'slack of interest in Wigand's story--the movie's most powerful--that damns himin the audience's eyes.                           The Insiderdoesn't note a couple of key, maybe hopeful ironies. The first is that CBS's"spiking" of the interview turned Wigand into an even bigger story than hewould have been otherwise. And in the "Where are they now?" titles at the end,the filmmakers omit the most important detail of Bergman's and Wigand's currentlives: that they're being played by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe in a majorHollywood movie, and that they're big news again.            Is there a less savory subgenre than the hardcore forensicsthriller? A corpse is discovered in a grotesque state of mutilation, then thescene shifts to an autopsy room where skulls are popped off and innards held upfor inspection. A short time later, detectives pore over glossies of fatalwounds. Yummy. In                   The Bone Collector               , the wily serial killerleaves clues for the brainy forensics expert, played by DenzelWashington--clues that amount to a forensics jigsaw puzzle. If Washingtonsolves the puzzle fast enough, he has a shot at saving the latest manacled andtortured victim; if not, he has to scour the gore-drenched death scene forclues to the next murder. Yummy yummy. One fact quickly becomes apparent: "Theperp knows forensics," murmurs Washington. Yummy yummy yummy.            The rub is that Washington is a quadriplegic. Hecan't "walk the grid"--he needs a pair of eyes as sensitive as his but attachedto a good pair of legs. As luck would have it, they're attached to a very goodpair of legs and a great pair of breasts. Angelina Jolie plays the cop whodiscovers a body and snaps some photos that convince Washington she has a"gift" for forensics. He dispatches his new protg to grisly crime scenes,purring into her headphones and demanding to know what she sees. Better thanphone sex! He says, "I want to know what you feel in the deepest recesses ofyour senses," and "Follow the instincts you were born with. ... Process thebody." I was thinking that she could process my body anytime, but Jolie risesabove such adolescent spasms. Well, almost. She's a thoughtful actress, but shewasn't born to play a beat cop. Those tire-tread lips are model lips; thoseexquisitely chiseled cheekbones, model cheekbones. Washington scans her file onhis fancy bedside computer: Guess what? She was a teen-age model! Cleversave!                           The Bone Collector is less rancid than thelast big serial-killer-fetishist picture, Copycat (1995), and it'sexpertly shot and edited. Phillip Noyce, the director, and Dean Semler, thecinematographer, cook up some eerily muzzy images inside the brackish tunnelsand abandoned warehouses where the fiend does his/her demented surgery. But thefilm is still a piece of exploitive schlock. A mediocre mystery, too: It neverapproaches the ingenuity of Thomas Harris, still the maestro of forensic porn.For some reason, Noyce telegraphs the identity of the killer halfway through(does he mean to? Or does the hammy framing give it away by accident?), butit's left to the laughably garish climax for the wacko to spell out his/herarbitrary motive. (The killer's lines are on the level of: "You think I'mm-m-mad, don't you?") The only aspect of The Bone Collector that can'tbe derided is Washington. The option of walking through the part clearly notavailable to him, he doesn't sleep through it either: Every muscle in thisman's ruined body seems to strain against his fate while the wheels in hisbrain grind fiercely. He deserves a smarter psycho--a smarter movie, too.
