November 2000 GAO s Congressional ProtocolsUnited States General Accounting Office Washington, D.C.20548November 3, 2000This document contains the protocols governing the GeneralAccounting Office's (GAO) work for the Congress. The need for theseprotocols was consistently voiced to me by Members of the Congressand their staffs since my nomination as Comptroller General. Ifirmly believe they will enable GAO to better serve the Congress,improve satisfaction with our work, and ensure equitable treatmentof all requesters.These protocols are intended to provide clearly defined andtransparent policies and practices relating to GAO's work. Theyalso provide a means of holding GAO accountable for commitmentsmade to the Congress and ensuring that GAO is consistent in dealingwith all committees and Members. They reflect a number ofrefinements made on the basis of feedback from Members and staffduring our trial implementation phase (January 2000 to September2000).Along with all members of the GAO team, I look forward to usingthese protocols to continue to serve the Congress for the benefitof the American people. We will continue to monitor the applicationof these protocols and will consider what, if any, changes shouldbe made in the future. Any changes will be made in consultationwith the Congress. I encourage you to contact our Office ofCongressional Relations on (202) 512-4400 if you have any questionsor comments on these protocols.David M. Walker Comptroller General of the United StatesContentsLetterGAO's Congressional ProtocolsGAO's Congressional ProtocolsGAO's ApproachThe following protocols are general principles governing GAOwork for the Congress involving audits, program reviews andevaluations, analyses, and investigations.To effectively support the Congress, GAO must be professional,objective, fact-based, nonpartisan, nonideological, fair, andbalanced in all its work. All GAO products and services shouldconform to generally accepted and applicable auditing, accounting,investigative, and evaluation principles and standards. GAO willonly undertake work that is within its scope of authority andcompetency. GAO will strive to meet the Congress' needs withinavailable resources and exercise the independence necessary toguarantee that its products and work conform to professionalstandards and the agency's core values of accountability,integrity, and reliability.Sources of GAO GAO undertakes work throughthree primary means:(1) congressional mandates, (2) congressional requests,Workand (3) legal authority allowing GAO to undertake work intendedto support the Congress.Setting PrioritiesGAO has a statutory obligation to fulfill requests from theCongress and its committees. To effectively accomplish thisobligation, GAO senior officials consult regularly with committeeMembers and their staffs to ensure that GAO's work is prioritizedin accordance with the committees' needs and GAO's resources bysubject matter. To ensure adherence to GAO's core values, effectivemanagement practices, and efficient use of available resources, GAOwill prioritize its work in the following order.1.Congressional mandates, senior leader requests, andcommittee leader requests2.Committee Member requests3.Individual Member requestsCongressional mandates include requirements specificallydirected by statutes, conference reports, or committee reports.Senior leader requests include requests from the President ProTempore, Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader, Speaker ofthe House, House Majority Leader, or House Minority Leader.Committee leader requests are those from the committee orsubcommittee Chair, Ranking Minority Member (Ranking Member), orboth, on a program or activity within the committee's jurisdiction.Committee Member requests are those involving a program or activitywithin the jurisdiction of the Member's assigned committees.Individual Member requests are those for work where the program oractivity is not within the jurisdiction of the Member's assignedcommittees.With respect to setting priorities, GAO considers the nature ofthe requested work in light of Senate and House rules governing thecommittees, including their appropriation, authorization,budgetary, and oversight jurisdiction over a program or activity.When jurisdictional issues arise, GAO will encourage Members andstaff to consult with each other to resolve any related disputes.In doing so, they may seek a resolution through the Senate or Houseparliamentarian.GAO devotes a limited portion of its resources for research anddevelopment that enables GAO to(1) invest in issues the Congress may need to address in thefuture and (2) provide products of broad institutional interest tothe Congress. This work includes compendiums such as periodicreports on highrisk areas and other governmentwide major managementchallenges.Congressional MandatesGAO treats work that is directed by congressional mandatesdifferently from congressional requests. Because congressionalmandates are established by either the entire Congress or one ormore committees, it is GAO's policy that products prepared inresponse to congressional mandates are issued without anyrestrictions (i.e., immediately available to the entire Congressand the public). When mandates direct GAO to report to a specificcommittee, GAO will work with the majority and minority of thedesignated committee to clarify our reporting objectives and timeframes. If the mandate does not specify a committee, GAO will workwith the committees of jurisdiction (majority and minority) as setforth in Senate and House rules and any other committees and/orMembers identified by the committees of jurisdiction. GAO will meetwith designated committees and Members regarding the scope andtiming of work. While the work is ongoing, GAO will provide them(1) periodic status reports on the work, (2) briefings on thepreliminary and final results of the work, and (3) notificationbefore the draft product is sent to the agency for comment andoffer a copy of the draft for informational purposes.Congressional RequestsCongressional requests for GAO work must be made in writing by aMember and addressed to the Comptroller General. Members or theirstaffs are encouraged to consult informally with GAOrepresentatives in developing requests for GAO work. GAO will dowork without a written request only if the work involves limitedtechnical assistance that can be completed within 5 staff days,such as providing briefings on prior work or readily availableinformation. GAO will refer any person who wants a copy of arequest letter to the Member who submitted it.For requests that involve work on programs or activitiesrelating to the internal operations of the Congress-theCommitment to CongressionalRequestersSenate, House, or both--GAO will work with the requester to seekbipartisan support for such requests. If the request affects bothHouses of Congress, GAO will work with the requester to seekbicameral support for the request from either (1) the seniorleaders of the Senate and House or (2) the Chairs and RankingMembers of the Senate and House committees of jurisdiction over thecongressional program or activity. If the request affects only oneHouse, GAO will work with the requester to seek support for therequest from either (1) the senior leaders of the affected Houseor(2) the Chair and Ranking Member of the committee(s) ofjurisdiction over the congressional program or activity. When it isnot possible to obtain bicameral or bipartisan support, GAO willwork with the requester to notify the other House or party of therequest before GAO commits itself to do the work. (SeeGAO-03-198G.)GAO will provide to all Members who request work, within 10business days of receipt, a letter acknowledging the receipt of therequest and either accepting or declining it. This letter may beaugmented by a verbal communication. When a request is accepted,GAO will provide the requester an estimate of when the job islikely to be staffed (e.g., immediately, within a few weeks, withinseveral months, or at a future date to be determined). When arequest is declined, GAO will provide the requester the rationalefor declining the work (e.g., the requested work is outside GAO'sscope of authority, GAO already has ongoing work addressing theissue, or resource constraints limit our ability to respond to aMember request). GAO will, where appropriate, suggest alternativesto meet the requester's needs. In consideration of its pastpractice for requests from GAO's oversight committees-SenateGovernmental Affairs and House Government Reform-GAO will send acopy of our letter to either the Chair (if the Ranking Membersubmitted the request) or the Ranking Member (if the Chairsubmitted the request) of those committees.Congressional requesters should not expect GAO to proceed withthe request or provide additional services until GAO has informedeach requester that it will accept the request. When Members submitindependent requests on the same issue and GAO has not formallyaccepted the requests, GAO will consult with the Members and theirstaffs and will merge requests only if the requesters agree.Otherwise, GAO will issue separate products. In limitedcircumstances, however, GAO will work with the requesters to mergemultiple requests it receives relating to a major event, such as anatural disaster or accident.After accepting the request, GAO will initiate a meeting withthe requester's staff within 20 business days of receiving therequest to gain a better understanding of the requester's need forinformation and the nature of the research questions. During thismeeting, GAO will also (1) discuss GAO's ability to respond withinthe desired time frame, (2) provide a verbal estimate of the levelof GAO resources required, and (3) advise the requester that, asthe original requester, only he or she can approve co-requesters.If this option is exercised, GAO will send a letter to the originalrequester and each co-requester documenting this agreement.Once the requester and GAO have agreed to proceed with therequest, GAO will provide the following to the requester:A letter confirming the agreements reached within 10business days after GAO and the requester agree on the terms,including the need for a job design phase and a preliminaryexpected completion date.Periodic status reports; notification of any significantchanged circumstances affecting the scope of work or related timeframes for completing the work (e.g., availability, reliability, oraccess to agency records,Commitment to Co-Requestersdata or sources of information); and briefing(s) on thepreliminary and final results of the work.The option to withdraw at any time sponsorship of workthat is not intended to result in a written product (e.g., areport).If GAO has agreed to produce a written product, GAO will:Notify the requester before a draft product is sent tothe agency for comment and offer the requester a copy of the draft.GAO will provide the draft, for informational purposes, when it issent to the agency for comment. By law, the Senate GovernmentalAffairs and House Government Reform committees may request a copyof any draft product generated under GAO's legislative authority(research and development work) when it is sent to the agency forcomment. GAO will advise these committees when such drafts are sentto the agency for comment.Allow the requester an option to restrict the release ofa product for up to 30 calendar days after the date the product isissued. This restriction does not preclude the requester fromsharing the product with other Members.Inform the requester of the option to withdrawsponsorship at any time before the product is submitted forprinting. GAO reserves the right to issue the product withoutreference to the requester when sponsorship iswithdrawn.If any Member is interested in becoming a co-requester of GAOwork, GAO will explain its policy on co-requests and refer theMember to the original requester. If the original requester agrees,the Member can become a co-requester any time before a product issubmitted for printing. GAO will extend the same commitments toPage 9 GAO-01-145G GAO's Congressional ProtocolsSupporting the Congress' InstitutionalInterestsco-requesters as to the original requester (see Commitment toCongressional Requesters). However, co-requesters cannot approveadditional co-requesters or restrict the timing of the release ofthe product after it is issued.In limited circumstances, GAO may be unable to do the requestedwork on behalf of a particular committee or Member. Thesecircumstances involve situations in which the request (1) addressesan important issue of broad interest to multiple committees or theCongress as a whole, (2) involves an issue that is a legislativepriority or is on a fast legislative track, or (3) asks for acompilation of information which GAO has developed from asubstantial body of prior work and/or work originally requested byothers. In such cases, GAO will advise the requester that it cannotdo the work as a request but will instead address the issue as partof GAO's research and development work.On rare occasions, the results of ongoing congressionallyrequested work may be important and relevant to pending legislation(e.g., when GAO has information which could inform the legislativedebate on the Senate or House floor) or other institutionalinterests. In such cases, GAO reserves the right, afterconsultation with the requester, to make the information or productgenerally available regardless of a restriction placed on itsrelease. In these cases, GAO will promptly notify the requesterswhy, when, and to whom the information or product will bereleased.Notification of Ongoing WorkFor ongoing work--except for classified work andinvestigations--GAO will disclose, if asked (e.g., by Members,congressional staff, agencies, or the press), the source of therequest and the project's objectives, scope, and methodology.Additionally, all congressionalPage 10 GAO-01-145G GAO's Congressional ProtocolsObtaining Agency Commentsoffices have, through Senate and House intranet connections toGAO, access to the objectives, scope, and methodology of active GAOassignments, except for those cases where the reporting of suchwork would result in disclosing classified or other sensitiveinformation. Active assignments are those that have beenstaffed.As required by generally accepted government auditing standards,GAO will hold an exit conference with agency officials at the endof the data collection and analysis phase to (1) validate thefactual accuracy of data gathered and (2) discuss the implicationsthat flow from them. Also, GAO will give agencies and otherdirectly affected parties the opportunity to officially comment ona draft report to which they are a party (other than reports thatlargely reflect prior GAO work). The substance of those commentswill be published in the report along with GAO's assessment.GAO prefers written comments but will accept oral comments.Although GAO may give an agency up to 30 calendar days to comment,GAO may attempt to obtain comments in shorter time frames,depending on the product timing needs of the requester and thecomplexity of the issues involved. In rare cases, the ComptrollerGeneral may grant an extension beyond 30 calendar days if theagency shows that an extension is necessary and will likely resultin a more accurate product.GAO will not provide an opportunity to comment in cases where(1) disclosure of an investigation's results could pose risks toindividuals and their confidentiality or (2) premature disclosureof information could compromise the results of the work.Termination of WorkIf requesters or co-requesters decide to withdraw their supportof GAO work that will not result in a written product (e.g., areport), they may do so at any time. If a written product has beenplanned, the requesters or co-requesters must advise GAO of theirwithdrawal before the product is submitted for printing. Theirwithdrawal will not result in the termination of a product ifsignificant resources have been expended and/or the product is inthe public interest. GAO will, under these circumstances, issue aproduct as if it were undertaken on its own authority. The productmay be addressed to committees of jurisdiction or the affectedagency. Copies of such products will be sent to the committees ofjurisdiction and will be available to other interested parties andthe public.Product ReleaseAll congressionally requested products will have a targetedissuance date. GAO will notify requesters approximately 30 calendardays before they are to receive a product and accommodate theirrequests for restrictions on the release of the product of up to 30calendar days after the issuance date. GAO will grant extensionsbeyond the 30 calendar days only in limited cases (e.g., a changein the date of a hearing related to the report). GAO reserves theright to release any product that has been issued but is underrestriction if it is leaked or otherwise made publicly available.In addition, GAO reserves the right to release drafts of productsthat have been leaked or made publicly available. In such cases,GAO will advise requesters prior to the release.Workpaper Access GAO will grant Members,upon their written request, access to its workpapers at the GAOsite or will provide copies of selected workpapers only after aproduct has been made publicly available. This is subject to legaland privacy considerations, such as those concerningPage 12 GAO-01-145G GAO's Congressional ProtocolsRequests for Testimonytaxpayer return information, protected banking information,grand jury information, and credit card accounts listed in travelvouchers.Requests for GAO testimony should be made by a committee Chairin writing. GAO will strive to respond to all congressionalrequests for testimony. However, GAO will decline an invitation totestify when (1) GAO cannot produce a testimony that conforms toits core values and standards or (2) the substance of the GAOtestimony would be new information developed for another committeeor Member who wants to restrict the information until its publicrelease. In cases of multiple requests for testimony involving thesame subject matter, GAO will testify on the date of the firsthearing held and will be available to testify at any subsequenthearings. For testimony based on new work, regardless of whether itis a preliminary or final product, GAO will, consistent withprofessional auditing standards, hold an exit conference withagency officials before the written testimony is completed to (1)validate the accuracy of data gathered and (2) discuss theimplications that flow from the data. GAO will distribute itswritten testimony in accordance with the rules of the Senate orHouse, including the committees' rules, and be available to briefthe majority and the minority on material facts, major findings,and recommendations relating to any new work.Detailees to the CongressBy law, GAO staff can be assigned on detail only tocongressional committees, not to leadership or personal offices.GAO staff may not engage in partisan activities or discussions.Committee requests for GAO detailees should be in writing and befor specific purposes for a period not to exceed 1 year. Alldetailees must be approved by the Comptroller General in amannerPress Policyconsistent with the applicable rules and policies of the Senateor House.In response to media inquiries about ongoing work, GAO willprovide information only about the objectives, scope, andmethodology of an assignment; the names of the requesters; and theexpected completion date. GAO will refer inquiries for anyadditional information to the requesters. As a professionalcourtesy, GAO will inform requesters of substantive media inquiriesduring an ongoing assignment. Once a product is publicly released,GAO staff with expertise in the subject matter will answerquestions from the media when asked. On-camera interviews fortelevision news programs are done only on request and only when GAOdeems them appropriate for public understanding of the facts,findings, conclusions, and recommendations of GAO products. GAO'spolicy is that senior executives with the broadest knowledge of acompleted assignment do such interviews. Before GAO agrees to do anon-camera interview, GAO will advise the requesters of the mediasource and the expected date and time. If asked to participate inpress briefings sponsored by requesters, GAO will provide supportif the press briefing is held in Washington, D.C. In suchinstances, GAO will provide knowledgeable staff with theunderstanding that they are present only to answer questions aboutthe specifics of released GAO products. GAO does not hold pressconferences or issue press releases about products, but it doesadvise the media and the public of the release of GAO products viathe World Wide Web and other venues.Investigations GAO has an Office of SpecialInvestigations that(1)investigates referrals concerning specific allegations offederal fraud, waste, abuse, or misconduct and(2)conducts specific projects that require specialinvestigative tactics. It is GAO's policy to conductPage 14 GAO-01-145G GAO's Congressional Protocolsinvestigations according to standards established by thePresident's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) as adaptedfor GAO's work. PCIE standards place upon GAO and its investigatorsthe responsibility to ensure that (1) investigations are conductedby personnel who collectively possess the required knowledge,skills, and abilities to perform the investigations, (2) judgmentsmade in collecting and analyzing evidence and communicating resultsare impartial, and (3) due professional care (e.g., thoroughness,appropriate use of investigative techniques, impartiality,objectivity, protection of individual rights, and timeliness) isexercised. GAO's congressional policies and protocols apply to allinvestigative work conducted by the Office of SpecialInvestigations unless an exception is specified herein or noted inadvance.Ordering InformationThe first copy of each GAO report is free.
