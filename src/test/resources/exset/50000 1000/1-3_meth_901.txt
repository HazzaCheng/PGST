2.1 INTRODUCTION2.1.1The objective of aquatic toxicity tests with effluents orpure compounds is to estimate the "safe" or "no-effect"concentration of these substances, which is defined as theconcentration which will permit normal propagation of fish andother aquatic life in the receiving waters. The endpoints that havebeen considered in tests to determine the adverse effects oftoxicants include death and survival, decreased reproduction andgrowth, locomotor activity, gill ventilation rate, heart rate,blood chemistry, histopathology, enzyme activity, olfactoryfunction, and terata. Since it is not feasible to detect and/ormeasure all of these (and other possible) effects of toxicsubstances on a routine basis, observations in toxicity testsgenerally have been limited to only a few effects, such asmortality, growth, and reproduction.2.1.2Acute lethality is an obvious and easily observed effectwhich accounts for its wide use in the early period of evaluationof the toxicity of pure compounds and complex effluents. Theresults of these tests were usually expressed as the concentrationlethal to 50% of the test organisms (LC50) over relatively shortexposure periods (one-to-four days).2.1.3As exposure periods of acute tests were lengthened, theLC50 and lethal threshold concentration were observed to declinefor many compounds. By lengthening the tests to include one or morecomplete life cycles and observing the more subtle effects of thetoxicants, such as a reduction in growth and reproduction, moreaccurate, direct, estimates of the threshold or safe concentrationof the toxicant could be obtained. However, laboratory life cycletests may not accurately estimate the "safe" concentration oftoxicants because they are conducted with a limited number ofspecies under highly controlled, steady state conditions, and theresults do not include the effects of the stresses to which theorganisms would ordinarily be exposed in the naturalenvironment.2.1.4An early published account of a full life cycle, fishtoxicity test was that of Mount and Stephan (1967). In this study,fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, were exposed to a gradedseries of pesticide concentrations throughout their life cycle, andthe effects of the toxicant on survival, growth, andreproduction were measured and evaluated. This work was soonfollowed by full life cycle tests using other toxicants and fishspecies.2.1.5McKim (1977) evaluated the data from 56 full life cycletests, 32 of which used the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas,and concluded that the embryo-larval and early juvenile life stageswere the most sensitive stages. He proposed the use of partial lifecycle toxicity tests with the early life stages (ELS) of fish toestablish water quality criteria.2.1.6Macek and Sleight (1977) found that exposure of criticallife stages of fish to toxicants provides estimates of chronicallysafe concentrations remarkably similar to those derived from fulllife cycle toxicity tests. They reported that "for a great majorityof toxicants, the concentration which will not be acutely toxic tothe most sensitive life stages is the chronically safeconcentration for fish, and that the most sensitive life stages arethe embryos and fry." Critical life stage exposure was consideredto be exposure of the embryos during most, preferably all, of theembryogenic (incubation) period, and exposure of the fry for 30days post-hatch for warm water fish with embryogenic periodsranging from one-to-fourteen days, and for 60 days post-hatch forfish with longer embryogenic periods. They concluded that in themajority of cases, the maximum acceptable toxicant concentration(MATC) could be estimated from the results of exposure of theembryos during incubation, and the larvae for 30 dayspost-hatch.2.1.7Because of the high cost of full life-cycle fish toxicitytests and the emerging consensus that the ELS test data usuallywould be adequate for estimating chronically safe concentrations,there was a rapid shift by aquatic toxicologists to 30- to 90-dayELS toxicity tests for estimating chronically safe concentrationsin the late 1970s. In 1980, USEPA adopted the policy that ELS testdata could be used in establishing water quality criteria if datafrom full life-cycle tests were not available (USEPA,1980a).2.1.8Published reports of the results of ELS tests indicatethat the relative sensitivity of growth and survival as endpointsmay be species dependent, toxicant dependent, or both. Ward andParrish (1980) examined the literature on ELS tests that usedembryos and juveniles of the sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodonvariegatus, and found that growth was not a statistically sensitiveindicator of toxicity in 16 of 18 tests. They suggested that theELS tests be shortened to 14 days posthatch and that growth beeliminated as an indicator of toxic effects.2.1.9In a review of the literature on 173 fish full life-cycleand ELS tests performed to determine the chronically safeconcentrations of a wide variety of toxicants, such as metals,pesticides, organics, inorganics, detergents, and complexeffluents, Woltering (1984) found that at the lowest effectconcentration, significant reductions were observed in fry survivalin 57%, fry growth in 36%, and egg hatchability in 19% of thetests. He also found that fry survival and growth were very oftenequally sensitive, and concluded that the growth response could bedeleted from routine application of the ELS tests. The net resultwould be a significant reduction in the duration and cost ofscreening tests with no appreciable impact on estimating MATCs forchemical hazard assessments. Benoit et al. (1982), however, foundlarval growth to be the most significant measure of effect andsurvival to be equally or less sensitive than growth in earlylife-stage tests with four organic chemicals.2.1.10Efforts to further reduce the length of partial lifecycletoxicity tests for fish without compromising their predictive valuehave resulted in the development of an eight-day, embryo-larvalsurvival and teratogenicity test for fish and other aquaticvertebrates (USEPA, 1981; Birge et al., 1985), and a seven-daylarval survival and growth test (Norberg and Mount,1985).2.1.11The similarity of estimates of chronically safeconcentrations of toxicants derived from short-term, embryo-larvalsurvival and teratogenicity tests to those derived from fulllife-cycle tests has been demonstrated by Birge et al. (1981),Birge and Cassidy (1983), and Birge et al. (1985).2.1.12Use of a seven-day, fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas,larval survival and growth test was first proposed by Norberg andMount at the 1983 annual meeting of the Society for EnvironmentalToxicology and Chemistry (Norberg and Mount, 1983). This test wassubsequently used by Mount and associates in field demonstrationsat Lima, Ohio (USEPA, 1984), and at many other locations (USEPA,1985c, USEPA, 1985d; USEPA, 1985e; USEPA, 1986a; USEPA, 1986b;USEPA, 1986c; USEPA, 1986d). Growth was frequently found to be moresensitive than survival in determining the effects of complexeffluents.2.1.13Norberg and Mount (1985) performed three single toxicantfathead minnow larval growth tests with zinc, copper, and DURSBAN,using dilution water from Lake Superior. The resultswere comparable to, and had confidence intervals that overlappedwith, chronic values reported in the literature for both ELS andfull life-cycle tests.2.1.14USEPA (1987b) and USEPA (1987c) adapted the fatheadminnow larval growth and survival test for use with the sheepsheadminnow and the inland silverside, respectively. When daily renewal7-day sheepshead minnow larval growth and survival tests and 28-dayELS tests were performed with industrial and municipal effluents,growth was more sensitive than survival in seven out of 12 larvalgrowth and survival tests, equally sensitive in four tests, andless sensitive in only one test. In four cases, the ELS test mayhave been three to 10 times more sensitive to effluents than thelarval growth and survival test. In tests using copper, the NoObservable Effect Concentrations (NOECs) were the same for bothtypes of test, and growth was the most sensitive endpoint for both.In a four laboratory comparison, six of seven tests producedidentical NOECs for survival and growth (USEPA, 1987a). Dataindicate that the inland silverside is at least equally sensitiveor more sensitive to effluents and single compounds than thesheepshead minnow, and can be tested over a wider salinity range,5-30 (USEPA, 1987a).2.1.15Lussier et al. (1985) and USEPA (1987e) determined thatsurvival and growth are often as sensitive as reproduction in28-day life-cycle tests with the mysid, Mysidopsisbahia.2.1.16Nacci and Jackim (1985) and USEPA (1987g) compared theresults from the sea urchin fertilization test, using organiccompounds, with results from acute toxicity tests using thefreshwater organisms, fathead minnows, Pimphales promelas, andDaphnia magna. The test was also compared to acute toxicity testsusing Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, and the mysid,Mysidopsis bahia, and five metals. For six of the eight organiccompounds, the results of the fertilization test and the acutetoxicity test correlated well (r2 = 0.85). However, the results ofthe fertilization test with the five metals did not correlate wellwith the results from the acute tests.2.1.17USEPA (1987f) evaluated two industrial effluentscontaining heavy metals, five industrial effluents containingorganic chemicals (including dyes and pesticides), and 15 domesticwastewaters using the two-day red macroalga, Champia parvula,sexual reproduction test. Nine single compounds were used tocompare the effects on sexual reproduction using atwo-week exposure and a two-day exposure. For six of the ninecompounds tested, the chronic values were the same for bothtests.2.1.18The use of short-term toxicity tests in the NPDES Programis especially attractive because they provide a more directestimate of the safe concentrations of effluents in receivingwaters than was provided by acute toxicity tests, at an onlyslightly increased level of effort, compared to the fish fulllife-cycle chronic and 28-day ELS tests and the 28-day mysidlife-cycle test.2.2TYPES OF TESTS2.2.1The selection of the test type will depend on the NPDESpermit requirements, the objectives of the test, the availableresources, the requirements of the test organisms, and effluentcharacteristics such as fluctuations in effluenttoxicity.2.2.2Effluent chronic toxicity is generally measured using amulti-concentration, or definitive test, consisting of a controland a minimum of five effluent concentrations. The tests aredesigned to provide dose-response information, expressed as thepercent effluent concentration that affects the survival,fertilization, growth, and/or development within the prescribedperiod of time (40 minutes to seven days). The results of the testsare expressed in terms of either the highest concentration that hasno statistically significant observed effect on those responseswhen compared to the controls or the estimated concentration thatcauses a specified percent reduction in responses versus thecontrols.2.2.3Use of pass/fail tests consisting of a single effluentconcentration (e.g., the receiving water concentration or RWC) anda control is not recommended. If the NPDES permit has a wholeeffluent toxicity limit for acute toxicity at the RWC, it isprudent to use that permit limit as the midpoint of a series offive effluent concentrations. This will ensure that there issufficient information on the dose-response relationship. Forexample, if the RWC is >25% then, the effluent concentrationsutilized in a test may be: (1) 100% effluent, (2) (RWC +100)/2,(3) RWC, (4) RWC/2, and (5) RWC/4. More specifically, if the RWC= 50%, the effluent concentrations used in the toxicity test wouldbe 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 12.5%. If the RWC is <25% effluentthe concentrations may be: (1) 4 times the RWC, (2) 2 times theRWC, (3) RWC, (4) RWC/2, and (5) RWC/4.2.2.4Receiving (ambient) water toxicity tests commonly employtwo treatments, a control and the undiluted receiving water, butmay also consist of a series of receiving waterdilutions.2.2.5A negative result from a chronic toxicity test does notpreclude the presence of toxicity. Also, because of the potentialtemporal variability in the toxicity of effluents, a negative testresult with a particular sample does not preclude the possibilitythat samples collected at some other time might exhibit chronictoxicity.2.2.6The frequency with which chronic toxicity tests areconducted under a given NPDES permit is determined by theregulatory agency on the basis of factors such as the variabilityand degree of toxicity of the waste, production schedules, andprocess changes.2.2.7Tests recommended for use in this methods manual may bestatic non-renewal or static renewal. Individual methods specifywhich type of test is to be conducted.2.3STATIC TESTS2.3.1Static non-renewal tests - The test organisms are exposedto the same test solution for the duration of the test.2.3.2Static-renewal tests - The test organisms are exposed toa fresh solution of the same concentration of sample every 24 h orother prescribed interval, either by transferring the testorganisms from one test chamber to another, or by replacing all ora portion of solution in the test chambers.2.4ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TOXICITY TESTTYPES2.4.1 STATIC NON-RENEWAL, SHORT-TERM TOXICITY TESTS:Advantages:1.Simple and inexpensive.2.More cost effective in determining compliance with permitconditions.3.Limited resources (space, manpower, equipment) required;would permit staff to perform more tests in the same amount oftime.4.Smaller volume of effluent required than for staticrenewal or flow-through tests.Disadvantages:1.Dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion may result from highchemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ormetabolic wastes.2.Possible loss of toxicants through volatilization and/oradsorption to the exposure vessels.3.Generally less sensitive than renewal because the toxicsubstances may degrade or be adsorbed, thereby reducing theapparent toxicity. Also, there is less chance of detecting slugs oftoxic wastes, or other temporal variations in wasteproperties.2.4.2 STATIC RENEWAL, SHORT-TERM TOXICITY TESTS:Advantages:1.Reduced possibility of DO depletion from high COD and/orBOD, or ill effects from metabolic wastes from organisms in thetest solutions.2.Reduced possibility of loss of toxicants throughvolatilization and/or adsorption to the exposurevessels.3.Test organisms that rapidly deplete energy reserves arefed when the test solutions are renewed, and are maintained in ahealthier state.Disadvantages:1.Require greater volume of effluent than non-renewaltests.2.Generally less chance of temporal variations in wasteproperties.SECTION 3HEALTH AND SAFETY3.1 GENERAL PRECAUTIONS3.1.1Each laboratory should develop and maintain an effectivehealth and safety program, requiring an ongoing commitment by thelaboratory management and includes: (1) a safety officer with theresponsibility and authority to develop and maintain a safetyprogram; (2) the preparation of a formal, written, health andsafety plan, which is provided to the laboratory staff; (3) anongoing training program on laboratory safety; and (4) regularlyscheduled, documented, safety inspections.3.1.2Collection and use of effluents in toxicity tests mayinvolve significant risks to personal safety and health. Personnelcollecting effluent samples and conducting toxicity tests shouldtake all safety precautions necessary for the prevention of bodilyinjury and illness which might result from ingestion or invasion ofinfectious agents, inhalation or absorption of corrosive or toxicsubstances through skin contact, and asphyxiation due to a lack ofoxygen or the presence of noxious gases.3.1.3Prior to sample collection and laboratory work, personnelshould determine that all necessary safety equipment and materialshave been obtained and are in good condition.3.1.4Guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardousmaterials must be strictly followed.3.2SAFETY EQUIPMENT3.2.1 PERSONAL SAFETY GEAR3.2.1.1Personnel must use safety equipment, as required, such asrubber aprons, laboratory coats, respirators, gloves, safetyglasses, hard hats, and safety shoes. Plastic netting on glassbeakers, flasks and other glassware minimizes breakage andsubsequent shattering of the glass.3.2.2LABORATORY SAFETY EQUIPMENT3.2.2.1Each laboratory (including mobile laboratories) should beprovided with safety equipment such as first aid kits, fireextinguishers, fire blankets, emergency showers, chemical spillclean-up kits, and eye fountains.3.2.2.2Mobile laboratories should be equipped with a telephoneto enable personnel to summon help in case of emergency.3.3GENERAL LABORATORY AND FIELD OPERATIONS3.3.1Work with effluents should be performed in compliancewith accepted rules pertaining to the handling of hazardousmaterials (see safety manuals listed in Section 3, Health andSafety, Subsection 3.5). It is recommended that personnelcollecting samples and performing toxicity tests should not workalone.3.3.2Because the chemical composition of effluents is usuallyonly poorly known, they should be considered as potential healthhazards, and exposure to them should be minimized. Fume and canopyhoods over the toxicity test areas must be used wheneverpossible.3.3.3It is advisable to cleanse exposed parts of the bodyimmediately after collecting effluent samples.3.3.4All containers should be adequately labeled to indicatetheir contents.3.3.5Staff should be familiar with safety guidelines onMaterial Safety Data Sheets for reagents and other chemicalspurchased from suppliers. Incompatible materials should not bestored together. Good housekeeping contributes to safety andreliable results.3.3.6Strong acids and volatile organic solvents employed inglassware cleaning must be used in a fume hood or under an exhaustcanopy over the work area.3.3.7Electrical equipment or extension cords not bearing theapproval of Underwriter Laboratories must not be used. Ground-faultinterrupters must be installed in all "wet" laboratories whereelectrical equipment is used.3.3.8Mobile laboratories should be properly grounded toprotect against electrical shock.3.4DISEASE PREVENTION3.4.1Personnel handling samples which are known or suspectedto contain human wastes should be immunized against tetanus,typhoid fever, polio, and hepatitis B.3.5SAFETY MANUALS3.5.1For further guidance on safe practices when collectingeffluent samples and conducting toxicity tests, check with thepermittee and consult general safety manuals, including USEPA(1986e), and Walters and Jameson (1984).3.6WASTE DISPOSAL3.6.1 Wastes generated during toxicity testing must be properlyhandled and disposed of in an appropriate manner. Each testingfacility will have its own waste disposal requirements based onlocal, state and Federal rules and regulations. It is extremelyimportant that these rules and regulations be known, understood,and complied with by all persons responsible for, or otherwiseinvolved in, performing toxicity testing activities. Local fireofficials should be notified of any potentially hazardousconditions.
