                                                            Dowism                        In "," Bruce Gottlieb, like Clive Crook before him,thinks he has found a flaw in our argument that stocks are undervalued. He hasnot. In a                   Slate                "" last year, Crook claimed that we werecontending that the value of a company is the present value of its stream offuture earnings and that such a contention was false. Gottlieb's piece, in aneasy-to-follow way, demonstrates Crook's argument that, if you value a firm bydiscounting its earnings, and all earnings are not paid out in dividends, thenyou are double-counting.            But the problem with what Crook and Gottlieb aresaying is that we never based our theory on earnings but instead, as wewrote in our Wall Street Journal piece on March 17, 1999, on the "moneya stock will put in your pockets through the profits generated by the companythat issued it." Neither in this year's piece nor in our March 30, 1998,Journal piece did we claim that all those profits--orearnings--would go into your pockets. What we said explicitly was that theproper figure to use to measure the cash generated by a company was somewherebetween the lower bound of the dividend that a firm pays and the upper bound ofits official after-tax earnings. Indeed, in our first piece we explicitlyhighlighted the fact that earnings are a problematic measure of cash flowbecause of the potential that a firm might grow simply through retentions.            But Crook and Gottlieb are intelligent,well-intentioned journalists. What led them astray? They both cite an argumentagainst our first piece raised by Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School. Heclaimed that it is a "mistake" to assume that dividends per share will postreal growth, as we did in our calculations, because dividends, in theory,should only just keep up with inflation.            Crook and Gottlieb appear to have been convincedthat real earnings growth only reflects retentions and that real dividendgrowth must be zero. While Siegel's point fits the simplest introductoryeconomic models, it is contradicted by the facts: Historical data on dividendsreveal significant real growth of dividends per share. For example, in thelatest edition of Siegel's excellent book Stocks for the Long Run , Table5-1 on Page 79 shows that the growth of real dividends per share has been 2.1percent on average since 1946 and positive since the 19 th century.(In our calculations, we assume 2.1 percent real growth in dividends.)            What Siegel, Crook, and Gottlieb say can'thappen--dividends growing faster than inflation--has been going on for almost130 years. Where has all this growth come from? We treat that question atlength in our book, relating the observation to theories at the frontier of thebranch of economics known as "Industrial Organization," but here is a hint: Thesimplest textbook model of the perfectly competitive firm doesn't do a greatjob of describing the companies that have driven the market higher andhigher.            Discounting dividends is uncontroversial, and thefact that they grow is clear. It is interesting that Gottlieb says that, on thestrength of dividends alone, the Dow should be about 14,000 using our theory.That is a good start. Even sticking with dividends alone, the number is pushedconsiderably higher than that if one accounts for repurchases and the taxadvantage associated with them. So much for the crazy stock market bubble. Dow14,000 is clearly a lower-bound estimate. Today, many enormous firms don't paydividends at all. These firms have value because, ultimately, they will delivercash to their shareholders.            Crook and Gottlieb think that all valuationtechniques are out the window for firms that don't pay dividends, but they aremisinformed. There is a very large peer-reviewed academic literature on thistopic. The basic idea is simple: You can base a value measure on earningsinstead of dividends if you can identify those things that you aredouble-counting and make sure that you only count them once. For example,earnings themselves are a reasonable measure of the dividend that you use toconstruct the value of the firm if all earnings are paid out each year. Such anexample is no pipe dream. Real Estate Investment Trusts, for example, pay out95 percent of their earnings, and many of them post earnings growth well aboveinflation year after year. In 1999 alone, REITs, on average, are expected toincrease their earnings by 10 percent, with inflation at about 2 percent. Whenfirms retain lots of earnings it gets more complicated, with the growth ofearnings increasing as more and more cash is retained in the firm. For thosewho can't wait until the fall release date of our book Dow 36,000 andwant to start thinking through these issues, check out the Spring 1995 issue ofthe journal Contemporary Accounting Research , which provides a number ofvaluable review articles of the some of the relevant academic work.            It is impossible toaddress every conceivable objection in a short article in the Wall StreetJournal or                   Slate               , which is one reason we are writing ourbook. We look forward to picking up this debate in the fall when we lay all ourfacts and arguments on the table. Until that time, we have a little homeworkassignment for Gottlieb and anyone else at                   Slate                who would liketo try. Microsoft's earnings have grown at an average rate of about 25 percentannually over the past 10 years. Microsoft pays no dividends. Were allMicrosoft's earnings consumed in running in place, as Gottlieb's modelsuggests? Should Microsoft be worth nothing since it doesn't pay an actualdividend today? Was the price increase over that period justified? What would afair price for Microsoft be if the risk premium were zero? We look forward totheir answers.                           --James K. Glassman and Kevin Hassett Washington                                             Bruce Gottliebreplies:                               Glassman and Hassett write in to say I havemisrepresented their argument. They do not, they say, value a stock by lookingat future earnings. They even agree that this would be a big mistake. Theyclaim to look instead at future cash flows to stockholders. The two authorsmight want to reread their original WSJ article, which says: "Assumethat after-tax earnings are a reasonable estimate of the cash flow from astock." In other words, there is no difference between my description of theirargument and their own.                                       Meanwhile, they have misrepresented myargument. My article does not say or imply that "real earnings growth onlyreflects retentions and that dividend growth must be zero" or that "allvaluation techniques are out the window for firms that don't pay dividends." Itsimply asserts that, in calculating a firm's potential value, you can't assumethat earnings are simultaneously retained and paid out--and that theGlassman-Hassett argument depends on precisely these conflicting assumptions.The argument is fallacious whether all the earnings are paid out, all areretained, or anything in between.                                       Glassman and Hassett now claim that they willsort out the components of retained earnings to avoid double-counting in theirforthcoming book. I look forward to it. But I boldly predict it won't workunless they have an entirely new thesis, since double-counting of corporateearnings is the core of their current one. The thesis is simply wrong andcannot be refined into sense. What's more, double-counting of all corporateearnings is how they get the figure in their title-- Dow 36,000 --sothat will have to go if they even start down Refinement Road.                                       It's obvious thatour discussion must rest until this ambitious book is published. For right now,it is worth noting that this letter is the first place where Glassman andHassett have explicitly admitted that equating earnings and dividends is amathematical sin. They refer to it as "double-counting," which indeed itis.                                       Speaking With the"Enemy"                        I've never read a more paranoid piece of writingthen James J. Cramer's "." At the risk of being lumped into Cramer's "legion ofenemies," I thought it worth highlighting some of the absurdities in thepiece.            Cramer writes that "[TokyoMex's] online following... is much bigger than mine. And my record of giving good financial guidance,publicly and privately, is better than his. So why the fuss over me while otherportfolio managers write every day about their stock picks and get no heat?"TokyoMex's activities deserve notice, but it's ridiculous to say that hisfollowing (via his own small Web site and Silicon Investor chat rooms) isbigger than Cramer's (whose thoughts have been distributed through not onlyTheStreet.com, but also ABCNEWS.com, Good Morning America , GQ ,Yahoo! Squawk Box , SmartMoney , Time , and PoliticallyIncorrect , among other media properties with vast audiences). TokyoMex maybe unsavory, but Cramer just sets him up as a straw man to burn him. Justbecause Cramer is more ethical than an infamous pump-and-dumpster doesn't meanthat his unusual position as both professional money manager and professionalfinancial journalist--and yes, it is unusual--isn't deserving of scrutiny andcriticism. The dual role is Cramer's gimmick, and more power to him for havingthe energy to exploit the possibilities inherent in straddling two worlds. Ifind his columns entertaining more often than not. But his situation isn'tcommon, so the argument of "everyone does it, why pick on me?" isn'trelevant.            Then Cramer says, "I don't write for the money, andI don't write for the notoriety, so giving them up wouldn't hurt." If it'strue, then give up your $250,000 salary and your stock options inTheStreet.com, stop writing about your personal life in your musings, andremove the iconic projection of yourself from your Web site. You don't have tostop providing the insights that only you can give to the ignorant investingmasses in order to forgo the money and fame that come along with your position.And, frankly, you shouldn't have to. But do us all the favor of not acting likeyou're just being noble.            Cramer continues, "[T]here is no difference betweena portfolio manager who recommends stocks in an interview to a reporter ... anda portfolio manager who recommends stocks in a column of his own." Say what?Extending that logic, there's no difference between a government that promotesits policies to an independent press and a government that runs its ownnewspapers. The second of the two scenarios Cramer describes conflates theinterested role of the portfolio manager with the presumably disinterested roleof the journalist. Don't tell me there aren't ethical challenges in that beyondthose posed by the first scenario.            Finally, Cramer writes, "The journalists who wouldstop me are complicit with that ignorance and are willing tools of those thatwould like the reader to have to rely on those who charge high commissions orhigh fees to unknowing, worried consumers of finance." This is a low blow. Thegeneral tone of Cramer's piece is dismissive of financial journalists (or atleast those who would criticize him) as know-nothings or, worse, conspirerswith the dark forces of the finance industry. But I've read Alan Abelson (theonly "enemy" Cramer refers to by name) off-and-on since I first got interestedin investing, and whatever else he is, he isn't a "tool" of the industry. Norare the vast majority of financial journalists. Sure, there are some hacks, butmost are intelligent folks who have the interests of their readers at the topof their agenda. Cramer notes that if investors don't find his writing worthy,he will "disappear from the writing firmament." Well, isn't that what wouldhappen to the "established" business press that Cramer so disdains, if hisaccusations were even partly true?            I really do likeTheStreet.com and                   Slate               , and I have my own conflicts (I work forMorningstar, whose site at www.morningstar.net is a competitor toTheStreet.com, a supplier to MoneyCentral, etc.). But Cramer's screed didn'treflect well on your publication or his.                   Slate                has been(unwittingly?) caught in the cross-fire that has been going on for a few yearsbetween Alan Abelson and James Cramer. It would have been better if youreditors had dispatched the enviably good James Surowiecki to cover the feud, orif you had invited the two to duke it out in a "Dialogue." Luckily, I don'thave to cancel my subscription to your zine in a fit of pique!            -- Cebra Graves New York City                           Good and NecessaryEvil                        Terry Jeffreyperpetuates an old shibboleth when he mentions Bill Clinton's "safe, legal, andrare" comment regarding abortion (see ). Jeffrey asks how we could want anygood thing to be rare. Presumably American involvement in World War II was agood thing--yet I doubt anyone would want it to happen again. There are other,less dramatic, examples; surely David Kaczynski's decision to alert the FBI tohis brother's suspicious activities was the right choice. Nonetheless, few ofus would want to face that decision ourselves--even if we are confident that wewould have chosen similarly. Not all moral choices are painless. One can want aparticular practice to be rare just because it is painful, even if it ismorally required (and not just permissible). So there is no contradiction inwanting abortions to be safe, legal, and rare.            -- Ananda Gupta Bethesda, Md.                                             Terry Jeffrey responds:                               This rejoinder employsfaulty logic. U.S. involvement in World War II was a good thing and, hopefully,not rare. I would hope that the United States would defend itself every time afascist power bombs Pearl Harbor. Likewise, I would hope that David Kaczynski'sgood thing in informing the FBI of evidence bearing on his brother's guilt wasalso not a rare thing. I would hope that every time Kaczynski, or anybody elsefor that matter, discovers that a brother of his is an environmentalistextremist bent on murdering people, that he will inform the FBI of thisevidence. If abortion, like defending oneself against fascists andenvironmentalist murderers, is a good thing, than it should not be rare. Goodbehavior should never be rare. It should be routine.                                                         Time IsMoney                        I have great respect and admiration for MarshallLoeb (that's not a throwaway line; I really do), but his explanation that hewas getting paid by Time , not the advertisers, is kind of funny (see"Culturebox: "). Imagine how                   Slate                and others would slice me upif you found out I was running a magazine about journalism--one that some calla "watchdog"--and was getting paid writing assignments from one of theorganizations I was supposed to be watching and, of course, not disclosing iton the pages of the magazine whenever the magazine writes about thatorganization. You'd probably even get a great quote from Marshall saying howtroubled he is by it. Might they cancel future assignments if a piece in themagazine really stings them? Might they add on assignments if a piececelebrates them? Mightn't it all just look bad even if everyone behaveshonestly?            For you to let thatexplanation go uncommented on was surprising. Seems to me that getting paid byTime , as opposed to advertisers whom the Columbia JournalismReview is not nearly as likely to be covering, is a bigger issue.            -- Steve Brill New York City                           Called on theCarpetbagger                        In "," David Greenbergsays that "for some politicians, such as Arizona's John McCain, living in anadopted home state doesn't seem to matter at all."
