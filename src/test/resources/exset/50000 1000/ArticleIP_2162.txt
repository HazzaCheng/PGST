                                 Welcome to SLATE            Anintroduction and apologia.            By MichaelKinsley            The name? It meansnothing, or practically nothing. We chose it as an empty vessel into which wecan pour meaning. We hope SLATE will come to mean good original journalism inthis new medium. Beyond that, who knows? Good magazines are exercises inserendipity. Credit--or blame--for the name "SLATE," by the way, goes to DavidWeld, then of Microsoft, now of Cognisoft Corp.            A Seattle cyberwag saysthat the name "SLATE" is appropriate, because whenever he asks anyone fromMicrosoft, "How's your project coming along?" the answer he usually gets is,"'s late." SLATE , in fact, has been reasonably prompt. Less than sixmonths ago, it was a four-page memorandum and a single Internet naif. SLATE isnot the first "webzine," but everyone in this nascent business is stillstruggling with some pretty basic issues. Starting an online magazine is likestarting a traditional paper magazine by asking: "OK, you chop down the trees.Then what?"            To be honest, we arerunning late on a few things. For the reader--you--there is good news and badnews here. The good news is that our billing system isn't ready yet. We intendto charge $19.95 a year for SLATE. That is far less than the cost of equivalentprint magazines, because there's no paper, printing, or postage. But $19.95($34.95 for two years) is more than zero, which is what Web readers are used topaying. We believe that expecting readers to share the cost, as they do inprint, is the only way serious journalism on the Web can be self-supporting.Depending completely on advertisers would not be healthy even if it werepossible.            And wewant to be self-supporting. Indeed one of SLATE's main goals is to demonstrate,if we can, that the economies of cyberspace make it easier for our kind ofjournalism to pay for itself. Most magazines like SLATE depend on someone'sgenerosity or vanity or misplaced optimism to pay the bills. Butself-supporting journalism is freer journalism. (As A.J. Liebling said, freedomof the press is for those who own one.) If the Web can make serious journalismmore easily self-supporting, that is a great gift from technology todemocracy.            For the moment, though, SLATE is yours for free. So enjoy.We expect to start requiring registration in a few weeks, and to requirepayment beginning Nov. 1.            The bad news for readersis that some features aren't quite ready yet. Prime among them is "The Fray,"our reader-discussion forum. Meanwhile, though, please e-mail any comments youmay have to slate@msn.com. We'll be publishing a traditional "Letters to theEditor" page until The Fray is up and running in a few weeks.            Weespecially need, and appreciate, your comments in these early weeks. Every newmagazine is a "beta" version for a while, especially a new magazine in a newmedium. SLATE has gotten enormous hype--some of it, to be sure, self-induced,but much of it not. We appreciate the attention. But of course, it also makesus nervous. We have a smaller budget and staff than most well-knownmagazines--even smaller than some webzines. We don't claim to have all theanswers. But, with your help, we plan to have all the answers by Christmas.[LINK TO TEXT BBB]                           So What's in It?                        First, let me urge you toread a special page called Consider Your Options. This page explains andexecutes the various ways you can receive and read SLATE. If you don't likereading on a computer screen, for example, there's a special version of SLATEthat you can print out in its entirety, reformatted like a traditional printmagazine. If you don't mind reading on a screen but hate waiting for pages todownload--and hate running up those online charges from your Internetprovider--you will soon be able to download the whole magazine at once and readit offline.            Also on the Consider YourOptions page, you can order SLATE to be delivered to your computer by e-mail.(Caution: This may not work with your e-mail system.) We'll even send youSLATE                on Paper , a monthly compilation of highlights from SLATE,through the U.S. Mail. (The cost is $29 a year. Call 800-555-4995 toorder.)            Individual copies ofSLATE                on Paper will be available exclusively at Starbucks. Andselected articles from SLATE will also appear in Time magazine.            While you're on theConsider Your Options page, please read about how to navigate around SLATE. Weuse page numbers, like a traditional print magazine, and have tried to make itas easy as possible either to "flip through" the magazine or to and from theTable of Contents.                           OK, But What's inIt??[STET double "??"]                        SLATEis basically a weekly: Most articles will appear for a week. But there will besomething new to read almost every day. Some elements will change constantly.Other elements will appear and be removed throughout the week. Every articlewill indicate when it was "posted" and when it will be "composted." As ageneral rule the Back of the Book, containing cultural reviews and commentary,will be posted Mondays and Tuesdays, the longer Features will be postedWednesdays and Thursdays, and the front-of-the-book Briefing section will beposted Fridays. If you miss something, you can easily call it up from ourarchive, "The Compost."( THIS NEEDS TO BE A HOT LINK)                        Let me try to describe a typical issue of SLATE.            The Readme column will notalways be as solipsistic as this one. It will usually be a commentary on publicaffairs by one of SLATE's editors.            Several regulardepartments in the Briefing section are attempts at "meta-news": the news aboutthe news, a sense of how the week's big stories are being played and perceived.The Week/The Spin takes a dozen or so topics, from this week'selection-campaign developments to the latest big book from Knopf, and analyses,as objectively [LINK TO TEXT CCC]as possible, the spin they're getting, thesub-angles that are emerging, and so on. In Other Magazines uses the covers andcontents of Time , Newsweek , etc., as a handy measure of what theculture considers important. (We aim to have these magazines in SLATE evenbefore they reach the newsstands or your mailbox.) The Horse Racetracks the presidential candidates like stocks, as priced by the opinion polls,the pundits, and a genuine market in political candidates run out of theUniversity of Iowa. Our man William Saletan will compute and analyze changes inthe pundits index.            TheGist, by contrast, is SLATE's effort to provide a quick education on somecurrent issue in a form as free of spin as possible. Also free of quotes,anecdotes, and other paraphernalia. The only 1,000 words you'll have to readwhen you might rather read nothing at all.            In a weekly department called Varnish Remover, politicalconsultant Robert Shrum will deconstruct a 30-second TV spot from the electioncampaign. You can download a video or audio clip of the spot itself."Assessment" will be a short, judgmental profile of some figure in the news.(Coming up soon: James Fallows on Wired magazine's godfather, NicholasNegroponte.)            Stanford economist PaulKrugman writes The Dismal Scientist, a once-a-month column on economic policy.(See his debut essay in this issue, about the economic war within the Clintonadministration.) University of Rochester economist Steven Landsburg writesmonthly on "Everyday Economics," using economic analysis to illuminate everydaylife. (His first column, in our next issue, will explain how sexual promiscuitycan actually reduce the spread of AIDS.)            "The Earthling" will be amonthly column by Robert Wright, contributor to the New Republic andTime , and author of the acclaimed book on evolutionary psychology,The Moral Animal . Other regular Briefing features will include a Presscolumn by our deputy editor, Jack Shafer.            Doodlennium is our weekly cartoon strip by Mark Alan Stamaty, whose"Washingtoon" appeared for many years in the Washington Post andTime . Our SLATE Diary will be an actual daily diary, written and postedevery weekday by someone with an interesting mind. Our first diarist is DavidO. Russell, writer and director of Flirting With Disaster . Our seconddiarist will be novelist Muriel Spark.                           Can There Possibly be More?                        Our Features sectionbegins each week with the Committee of Correspondence, our e-mail discussiongroup. The committee is run by Herbert Stein, a former chairman of thepresident's Council of Economic Advisers best-known now for his witty columnsin the Wall Street Journal . We have great hopes for e-mail as a mediumof debate that can combine the immediacy of talk-television with theintellectual discipline of the written word. We hope for something halfwaybetween The McLaughlin Group and the correspondence page of the NewYork Review of Books . Will it work? Check out our first attempt--DoesMicrosoft Play Fair?--and let us know what you think.            The Features section isalso where we run longer articles [LINK TO TEXT DDD] and occasional humorpieces (that is, pieces that are intentionally, or at least aspirationally,humorous). This week in The Temptation of Bob Dole, SLATE's Washington editor,Jodie Allen, cruelly analyzes the arguments for a tax cut. Social criticNicholas Lemann writes on Jews in Second Place, about what happens to AmericanJews as Asians replace them at the top of the meritocracy. And the legendaryrecluse Henry David Thoreau emerges to give SLATE readers an exclusive peek athis new Web page.            InSLATE Gallery, we have a continuous exhibition of computer-based art. You maylike or dislike this stuff (we'll have plenty of linked commentary to help youdecide). What appeals to us about computer art is that SLATE can show you notreproductions, but the actual art itself. We start with an offering by JennyHolzer.            This week's reviews include Ann Hulbert's book review ofMiss Manners' latest encyclical; Sarah Kerr's television review of the changingfashions in season finales; Larissa MacFarquhar's High Concept column, abouthow managed care could improve psychotherapy; and Cullen Murphy's The GoodWord, about the difference between "Jesuitical" and "Talmudic."            In general, SLATE's Backof the Book will contain a weekly book review, alternating television and moviereviews, and a rotating menu of columns on music (classical and popular),sports, web sites, and other topics. Jeffrey Steingarten will be writingmonthly on food ("In the Soup"), Anne Hollander on fashion ("Clothes Sense"),and Margaret Talbot on "Men and Women." Audio and video clips will be offeredwhere appropriate.            Every issue will have apoem, read aloud by the author, with text. In this issue is a new poem bySeamus Heaney.            Andcoming up soon, two additional Back of the Book features: an interactiveacrostic puzzle, and a stock-market contest.                           Does SLATE Have a Slant?                        SLATE is owned byMicrosoft Corp., and that bothers some people. Can a giant software company putout a magazine that is free to think for itself? All we can say is thatMicrosoft has made all the right noises on this subject, and we look forward toputting the company's hands-off commitment to the test. But the concern strikesme as misplaced. In a day of media conglomerates with myriad daily conflicts ofinterest--Time Warner, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Disney-ABC--how can it be abad thing for a new company to begin competing in the media business? Ajournalist who worries about Microsoft putting out a magazine is a journalistwith a steady job.            Readers may also wonderwhether SLATE will have a particular political flavor. The answer is that we donot set out with any ideological mission or agenda. On the other hand, we arenot committed to any artificial balance of views. We will publish articles fromvarious perspectives, but we will not agonize if the mix averages out to besomewhere other than dead center. [LINK TO TEXT EEE]            A good magazine, though,does develop a personality, an attitude, [LINK TO TEXT FFF]and someprejudices--even crotchets. A few of SLATE's are already becoming clear. Indiscussing current events, we have a preference for policy over politics. We'drather discuss the effect of Bob Dole's tax-cut proposal on the economy thanits effect on Bill Clinton. Within the policy arena, we seem to have a specialfondness for economics. This was not planned; it's one of those serendipitousdevelopments I mentioned. Whether it reflects good luck or bad luck is a matterof taste (yours).            Finally, we intend to takea fairly skeptical stance toward the romance and rapidly escalating vanity ofcyberspace. We do not start out with the smug assumption that the Internetchanges the nature of human thought, or that all the restraints that societyimposes on individuals in "real life" must melt away in cyberia. There is adeadening conformity in the hipness of cyberspace culture in which we don'tintend to participate. Part of our mission at SLATE will be trying to bringcyberspace down to earth.            Should be fun. Thanks forjoining us.                           Michael Kinsley iseditor of SLATE.                         TEXT AAA: No, this isnot a link to the Cognisoft home page. As a general rule, we plan toavoid hyperlinks to outside sites in the text of articles, and to group them atthe end instead. It's a small illustration of our general philosophy--bettercall it a hope--that, even on the Web, some people will want to read articlesin the traditional linear fashion--i.e., from beginning to end--rather thandarting constantly from site to site. Go back.            TEXT BBB: Only kidding.Easter. Go back.            TEXT CCC: Objectivity, wehope, will distinguish this feature from Newsweek 's "Conventional WisdomWatch," which is often an effort to set the spin rather than describe it.Anyway, the "CW Watch" was a rip-off of a similar feature in the NewRepublic when I was the editor there. And TNR 's feature itself waslifted from Washington, D.C.'s, City Paper , which was edited at the timeof the theft by Jack Shafer, now deputy editor of SLATE. Go back.            TEXT DDD: Those dreadwords "longer articles" raise one of the big uncertainties about thisenterprise: How long an article will people be willing to read on a computerscreen? We have several answers to this question: 1) We don't know. Clearlyit's less than on paper, but how much less is uncertain. 2) We're determined totest the outer limits. 3) We'll do our best, graphically, to make reading onscreen a more pleasant experience (suggestions welcome). 4) We'll also makeSLATE as easy as possible to print out. 5) This will become less of a problemas screens are developed that can be taken to bed or the bathroom. 6) Twothousand words. Or at least we're starting--optimistically, perhaps--with thehope that 2000 words or so is not too much. (By contrast, a typicalprint-magazine feature or cover story might run anywhere from 5000 to 15,000words.)            At least amongnon-cyberheads, the computer-screen problem seems to be everyone's favoriteconversational thrust with regard to SLATE. In recent months I've been amazedto learn of the places and postures in which people like to read magazines. Bedand bath are just the beginning. At a Seattle dinner party, a woman made theinteresting point that her problem isn't the screen: It's the chair. Even"ergonomic" computer chairs are designed for typing, not for reading. For thiswoman, and for others who may feel the same way, we have asked severalfurniture designers to sketch a real computer reading chair--one you can curlup in with your mouse and your cup of Starbucks and read SLATE online. Thatfeature will appear in a week or two. Go back.            TEXT EEE: In this regardwe are more like the newsmagazines-- Time , Newsweek , U.S. News& World Report --than the overtly political magazines such as the NewRepublic , National Review , or the Weekly Standard . Each ofthe newsmagazines may have an identifiable political tilt. But pushing aparticular line is not what they are fundamentally about, and knowing wherethey average out won't tell you what any individual article will say. Goback.            TEXT FFF: This isdifferent from "attitude"--that free-floating, supercilious cynicism that ismuch prized in the culture of cyberspace. We may develop an attitude--aset of prejudices derived from logic and evidence, as best we can determinethem--but we'll leave "attitude" to the kids. Go back.
