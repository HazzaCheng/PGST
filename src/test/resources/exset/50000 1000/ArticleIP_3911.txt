Hitler'sWilling Historiographers                        In "Goldhagen's WillingExecutioners," his review of my A Nation on Trial [hereafterANOT ], Adam Shatz suggests that I am a mirror image of Daniel Goldhagen.My essay is "equally biased and inflammatory," he writes, and whereas Goldhagendelivered a fierce attack on the Germans, my own essay is effectively an"apologia" for them.            Before turning to Shatz'sspecific criticisms, I want to remind readers of the approach I adopted in myanalysis of Goldhagen's book. Throughout, I simply juxtapose Goldhagen's claimsagainst the sources he cites or compare his claims to the standard, mainstreamscholarly findings. Until Shatz's review, no one disputed my account of thescholarly record. Indeed, his vehement criticisms of my essay notwithstanding,Goldhagen himself does not accuse me of misrepresenting current scholarlywisdom. Thus Shatz's altogether novel critique merits close scrutiny.            Shatz reports that"Finkelstein acknowledges the Nazi state was a brutal dictatorship, but heglosses over its disturbingly popular character."            What canShatz possibly mean? Goldhagen claims that the Nazi regime "was, on the wholeconsensual," and that Germans generally "accepted the system and Hitler'sauthority as desirable and legitimate." I report that, according to Goldhagen'sown main authority, Robert Gellately, fear was "prevalent among the Germanpeople," and that to pretend otherwise is "foolish" ( ANOT : 37). Clearlythe principal question, however, is how central was anti-Semitism to what Shatzcalls the "disturbingly popular character" of the Nazi state? I quote thistypical passage from Goldhagen's main source, Ian Kershaw:            Anti-Semitism, despite itspivotal place in Hitler's "world view," was of only secondary importance incementing the bonds between Fuhrer and people which provided the Third Reichwith its popular legitimation and basis of plebiscitary acclamation. At thesame time, the principle of excluding the Jews from German society was itselfwidely and increasingly popular, and Hitler's hatred of the Jews--baleful inits threats but linked to the condoning of lawful, "rational" action, not theunpopular crude violence and brutality of the Party's "gutter" elements--wascertainly an acceptable component of his popular image, even if it was anelement "taken on board" rather than forming a centrally motivating factor formost Germans.            I add that, according toKershaw, "during the 1930s ... when his popularity was soaring to dizzyheights," Hitler "was extremely careful to avoid public association with thegenerally unpopular pogrom-type anti-Semitic outrages" ( ANOT : 31).            Shatz is surely within hisright to question these findings. But he ought to have directed his ire not atme but at the leading authorities on the subject: Gellately, who was justappointed to the Holocaust chair at Clark University, and Kershaw, author ofthe forthcoming two-volume biography of Hitler.            Shatz alleges that"anti-Semitism permeated Nazi ideology, and Finkelstein is deaf to itsnuances." Thus he proposes that anti-Semitism was crucial to Hitler's rise topower. Citing a raft of scholarly studies, I report the consensus thatanti-Semitism did not figure centrally in Hitler's electoral successes in 1930and thereafter ( ANOT : 31-2). I also note the scholarly consensus that,beginning in the 1930s--to quote Saul Friedlander in his authoritativestudy , Nazi Germany and the Jews --"the Jewish theme did become lessfrequent in [Hitler's] rhetoric." Finally, I report that a careful review ofMax Domarus' standard collection of Hitler's public pronouncements and speechesshows that, during these years, the main negative theme was anti-Marxism andanti-Social Democracy ( ANOT : 29, 32). Shatz seems to believe that he has"scooped" all the experts in the field with his clever insight that "the Nazisperceived Social Democracy as a Jewish party and Marxism as a Jewish creed."The scholarly question, however, is why did Hitler tone down the explicitly"Jewish theme," if not because it didn't resonate well with the German public?Shatz doesn't answer this question; indeed, he can't even comprehend it. ToGoldhagen's credit, he never gainsays this commonplace of the scholarlyliterature. Unlike Shatz, he is familiar enough with the discipline to knowthat it would be preposterous to do so.            According to Shatz,"Finkelstein deduces from some Germans' disgust at the destruction of Jewishlives and property during Nazi-sponsored pogroms such as Kristallnacht that'Germans overwhelmingly condemned the Nazi anti-Semitic atrocities.' If theydid, they gave new meaning to the term 'silent majority.' "            Of all Shatz's distortions,this is the most outrageous. Where does he get his reading of Kristallnacht?Here's where mine comes from. In assessing the popular German reaction to Naziviolence generally and Kristallnacht in particular, I quoted Goldhagen'sauthoritative scholarly source, Israeli historian David Bankier, as well asKershaw:            During the first years ofNazi anti-Semitic incitement [says Bankier], most Germans ("large sectors,""the bulk," "sizable parts") found "the form of persecution abhorrent,"expressed "misgivings about the brutal methods employed," "remained on thesidelines," "severely condemned the persecution," etc. With the revival of Nazianti-Semitic terror in 1935, "large sections of the population were repelled bythe Sturmer methods and refused to comply with demands to take action againstthe Jews." Indeed, the "vast majority of the population approved the Nuremberglaws" not only because they "identified with the racialist policy" but"especially" because "a permanent framework of discrimination had been createdthat would end the reign of terror and set precise limits to antisemiticactivities." "Sturmer methods and the violence" in the years 1936-37 "met withthe same disapproval as in the past." "The overwhelming majority approvedsocial segregation and economic destruction of the Jews" on the eve ofKristallnacht in 1938 "but not the outbursts of brute force. ... [I]t was notJew-hatred in the Nazi sense." "All sections of the population," Bankierfurther reports, "reacted with shock" to Kristallnacht. "There were fewoccasions, if any, in the Third Reich," Kershaw similarly recalls, "whichproduced such a widespread wave of revulsion," reaching "deep into the ranks"of the Nazi party itself. The motives behind these outpourings of populardisgust, to be sure, were not unalloyed. Some Germans evinced moral outrage.Some recoiled from the sheer brutality of the violence (which also defacedGermany's image). Some opposed the destruction only because it squanderedmaterial resources ( ANOT : 44).            The opinions Shatz ascribesto me are simply the scholarly consensus. Significantly, he adduces not a jotof counterevidence for his novel claim that only "some Germans" opposedKristallnacht. Alas, there is none. Shatz also violently dissents from thescholarly consensus on civilian German attitudes toward Jews during World WarII. Yet again, however, he cites precisely zero evidence to support hisobjections.            Tosustain his claim that my essay is effectively an "apologia," Shatz substitutesappeals to popular prejudice for scholarship. Shatz calls me Goldhagen's"doppelganger." It would seem that this honorific more properly belongs tohim.            -- Norman G.Finkelstein Brooklyn, N.Y.                           AdamShatz replies:                        In his reply, NormanFinkelstein's modus operandi is to cite authority, and where he cannot hidebehind authority, he distorts the points I made in my review. He insinuatesthat I'm a friend of Daniel Goldhagen, even though I made my hostility toGoldhagen's views amply clear elsewhere in the review. But Finkelstein'sattempt to tar me with the brush of Goldhagenism is telling. To Finkelstein,anyone who views German anti-Semitism as in any way significant to the historyof National Socialism is an accomplice of Goldhagen.            1) Nowhere in my review do I argue thatanti-Semitism was "crucial to Hitler's rise to power." Rather, I argue that itcannot be blithely discounted, as is Finkelstein's wont. In wooing Germanvoters, the Nazis did tone down their anti-Semitism, emphasizing instead theirnationalist and anti-Bolshevik credentials. But unlike Finkelstein, I see achange in degree, not in kind. Anti-Semitism remained a constant theme of Naziideology, which associated Jews with the ills of modern capitalism,internationalism, socialism, and the Versailles Treaty. While it's true thatGermans were often alienated by violent expressions of anti-Semitism, enough ofthem were willing to look past Nazi rhetoric about the Jewish problem to makethe Nazis Germany's most significant mass party. As Ian Kershaw writes in thepassage cited by Finkelstein, anti-Semitism was "an acceptable component of[Hitler's] popular image." In recent years, a similar development has occurredin France, where Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front has softened hisanti-Arab racism in order to attract more votes. Employing Finkelstein's logic,one would have to argue racism hasn't really figured in Le Pen's surge inpopularity. But it's a distinction without a difference--more and more votersare backing a party known for its racist program. It's a wonder thatFinkelstein doesn't see how damning this is. But then, Finkelstein findsreassurance in Goldhagen's observation that 19 of 51 anti-Semitic ideologuesadvocated the annihilation of the Jews. "One would perhaps also want to notethat an overwhelming majority did not," Finkelstein writes.            2) Finkelstein'sinterpretation of Kristallnacht is not "simply the scholarly consensus." Whileevoking German outrage at such state-sponsored pogroms, the historians DavidBankier and Kershaw do not conclude that the "Germans overwhelmingly condemnedthe Nazi anti-Semitic atrocities." Where does Finkelstein find evidence of suchcondemnation? Were there such protests as later surrounded the euthanasiaprograms for the retarded? Were Germans moved to speak out against the popularlegal restrictions on Jewish rights? In a study much cited by Finkelstein,Hitler, Germans and the "Jewish Question," historian Sarah Gordon writesthat "Most Germans were apathetic to the persecution of the Jews and no study,past or future, can ever change that fact." One does not have to acceptGoldhagen's views to see that the Germans' disgust at Kristallnacht seldomresulted in action on behalf of their Jewish neighbors.            3)Finally, does Finkelstein suppose that a brutal dictatorship cannot also be apopular one? As most historians have recognized, Hitler's triumphs in foreignpolicy and the economy earned him the admiration of many, if not most Germans.If the Nazi state had rested only on coercion, it's doubtful that Hitler couldhave persuaded millions of Germans to remain loyal to him, and to fightheroically to the end of the war. As Kershaw writes in the passage quoted byFinkelstein, the Nazi state enjoyed a certain "popular legitimation and basisof plebiscitary acclamation." Although anti-Semitism was less significant thannationalism and anti-Bolshevism to the Nazis' mass appeal, Hitler and his peerswere able to execute the Final Solution because they could count on theallegiance, and sometimes even the love, of the German people. To be sure,Goldhagen's vision of a "consensual dictatorship" glosses over the repressionof the labor movement, the killing and imprisonment of Hitler's opponents. ButFinkelstein's view of a Nazi terror state forcing its programs on a helplesspeople is equally one-sided. The Nazis were homegrown populists, even if theirwish to murder Jews was not widely shared by Germans, and the Germans must, inturn, bear some of the responsibility for the horrors the Nazis inflicted.                           Editor's note:"Goldhagen'sWilling Executioners" incorrectly stated that the Canadian Jewish Congressis trying to have Ruth Bettina Birn, co-author of A Nation on Trial: TheGoldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth , removed from her job at the warcrimes division at the Canadian Department of Justice. The Canadian JewishCongress did contact the department with its concerns about Birn's involvementin the book. But the CJC has lodged no formal complaint against Birn.                                       GrossMonica Product                        In"Monicaand Me," Herbert Stein wrote:            I wonder if the work ofthese photographers [watching for Monica Lewinsky] is in the GDP. Of course, itwouldn't be. They are an input. The output will be a shot on television ofMonica, and the value of that will be in the GDP.            No, Mr. Stein. The shot ontelevision of Monica Lewinsky will not be in the GDP--at least, it will not bein the GDP if the shot is on network television. You see, no one paysfor network television: No one spends money to see Lewinsky coming out of theWatergate.            Instead, businesses spendmoney to show commercials on network television: The picture of Lewinsky isjust an input into the provision of advertising services that corporations arewilling to pay for.            But wait! Advertisingservices are not an output, but an input. Businesses pay for advertisingservices as a way of moving their products. Advertising services are an inputto the cost of production of whatever is being advertised.            Thephotographer's work will make it into the GDP only when someone buys a bottleof Tylenol, or a Buick, or whatever is advertised on the news show in which thepicture of Lewinsky is shown.            -- Brad DeLong                                       Herbert Stein replies:Professor DeLong is right and I thank him for the correction. I also thank himfor leaving me a tiny out in those cases where Monica is seen on cable.

It was appreciated, although Gates' brazen efforts atself-promotion on the basis of increasingly poor scholarship have been the talkamong African-American intellectuals for some time.

(Did that othermixed-race Alexander, Pushkin, make the cut?) Dumas received the same sort ofaccusation that Foer makes of Gates, of overusing the services of uncreditedcollaborators and thus diluting the value of his name.
