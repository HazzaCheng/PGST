We received the rule on August 29, 1996. It waspublished in the Federal Register as a final rule on August 30,1996. 61 Fed. Reg. 46166.The final rule revises the prospective payment systems foroperating and capital costs for inpatient services under MedicarePart A. Among other things, the final rule adjusts theclassifications and weighting factors for diagnosis related groupsas required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Social Security Act, 42U.S.C.  1395ww(d)(4)(C); updates the wage index associated withhospital operating costs; and makes certain clarificationsconcerning the calculation of payments to hospitals excluded fromthe prospective payment systems.GAO/OGC-96-41Enclosed is our assessment of HCFA's compliance with theprocedural steps required by sections 801(a)(1)(B)(i) through (iv)of title 5 with respect to the rule. Our review indicates that HCFAcomplied with the applicable requirements.If you have any questions about this report, please contactHelen T. Desaulniers, Senior Attorney, at (202) 512-4740.

Murphy General Counselcc: The Honorable Donna E. Shalala Secretary Department ofHealth and Human ServicesPage 2 GAO/OGC-96-41ENCLOSUREANALYSIS UNDER 5 U.S.C.  801(A)(1)(B)(i)-(iv) OF A MAJOR RULEISSUED BY THE HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OFHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ENTITLED "MEDICARE PROGRAM; CHANGES TOTHE HOSPITAL INPATIENT PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND FISCAL YEAR1997 RATES" (RIN: 0938-AH34)(i) Cost-benefit analysisSection 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1302(b),requires the Secretary to prepare regulatory impact analyses forany rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of asubstantial number of small rural hospitals. An initial analysis,to be prepared for a proposed rule, is to describe the impact ofthe proposed rule on such hospitals and include the mattersrequired under 5 U.S.C.  603. The final analysis, to be preparedfor a final rule, must include, with respect to small ruralhospitals, the matters required under 5 U.S.C.  604. The HealthCare Financing Administration (HCFA) determined that the proposedrule would affect a substantial number of small rural hospitals,and that the effects on some could be significant. HCFA alsodetermined that the rule could have a significant impact on otherclasses of hospitals as well.1 Therefore, as discussed below, HCFAprepared combined regulatory impact/regulatory flexibility analysesin connection with the rule.HCFA did not prepare an additional analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12866.(ii) Actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5U.S.C.  603-605, 607 and 609Initial analysisHCFA included the full text of its combined initial regulatoryimpact/regulatory flexibility analysis (analysis) as an appendix tothe May 31, 1996 proposed rule. See 61 Fed. Reg. 27566-27584. Inresponse to our inquiry, HCFA staff explained that it did notsubmit a copy of the analysis to SBA. However, in HCFA's view, itspublication of the full text of the analysis with the proposed rulesatisfied the1HCFA considers all hospitals to be small entities for purposesof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.GAO/OGC-96-41submission requirement. We have learned that some agenciesfollow this practice without objection from SBA.As required by 5 U.S.C.  603(b)(1) and (2), the analysis,coupled with the summary in the preamble, explains the reasons andobjectives, as well as legal bases, for the proposed rule. Section1886(d) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395ww(d),generally provides for a system of payment for the operating costsof hospital inpatient services under Medicare Part A based onprospectively set rates. In addition, under section 1886(g) of theSocial Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395ww(g), capital-related costsfor those hospitals whose operating costs are paid under aprospective payment system are also to be paid based onprospectively set rates. In response to directives contained inthese sections and HCFA's experience, the rule adjusts variouselements associated with hospital costs. 61 Fed. Reg. at27444-27445. According to the analysis, the changes are designed tofurther the objectives of the prospective payment system,2 whilemaintaining the financial viability of the hospital industry andensuring access to high quality health care for Medicarebeneficiaries. 61 Fed. Reg. at 27566.Consistent with section 603(b)(3), the analysis describes, andestimates the number of, small entities to which the rule willapply. The rule will apply to 82 percent of the general,short-term, acute care hospitals that participate in the Medicareprogram, or 5,130 hospitals, all of which are considered smallentities by HCFA. Of the 5,130 hospitals, 2,252 are rural. Theanalysis describes and illustrates the impact of the rule onvarious types of rural and urban hospitals.As discussed below, the proposed rule would modify an existingreporting requirement applicable to all hospitals serving Medicarebeneficiaries. HCFA did not discuss the proposed change in itsanalysis, but in the preamble to the proposed rule.3 Thus, HCFAalso satisfied its responsibility under 5 U.S.C.  603(b)(4).Finally, with respect to sections 603(b)(5) and (c), theanalysis does not identify any federal rules that duplicate,overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule or any significantregulatory alternatives. Since, according to HCFA, all hospitalssubject to the rule are small entities, it would be difficult tominimize the impact of the rule on such entities within theconstraints of the Medicare program. As discussed2The objectives of the prospective payment system are toencourage hospitals to operate efficiently, while ensuring thatthey are compensated for legitimate costs. 61 Fed. Reg. at27566.3Under 5 U.S.C.  605(a), agencies may perform the analysesrequired by sections 603 and 604 in conjunction with or as part ofany other agenda or analysis required by other law if such otheranalysis satisfies the provisions of these sections.Page 2 GAO/OGC-96-41below, HCFA addressed comments on various elements of theproposed rule throughout the preamble to the final rule.Final analysisConsistent with 5 U.S.C.  604, HCFA included the full text ofits final analysis as an appendix to the final rule. 61 Fed. Reg.46166, 46303-46320. As in the case of the initial analysis, HCFAsummarized the need for the rule in the preamble. 61 Fed. Reg. at46166-46167. In the final analysis, HCFA replaced the "Objectives"section with a discussion of changes to the initial analysis. See61 Fed. Reg. at 46303-46304.With respect to section 604(a)(2), the analysis issued with thefinal rule states that HCFA received no comments on the methodologyused in its initial analysis. 61 Fed. Reg. at 46304. It also statesthat any differences between the two analyses resulted from HCFA'suse of "more recent or more complete hospital data." 61 Fed. Reg.at 46303.The analysis describes, and estimates the number of, smallentities to which the rule will apply as required by section604(a)(3). See 61 Fed. Reg. at 46304. The analysis indicates thatthe rule will apply to 5,129, rather than 5,130, general,short-term, acute care hospitals. Id. The analysis indicates adecrease of four rural hospitals and an increase of three urbanhospitals, for a net decrease of one. 61 Fed. Reg. at 46306. Thefinal analysis also describes the rule's impact on covered entitiesand, like the earlier analysis, specifically distinguishes betweenurban and rural hospitals.HCFA did not discuss its proposed modification of an existingreporting requirement in the analysis, as described in section604(a)(4), but in the preamble. Also, like the earlier analysis,the final analysis does not discuss steps taken to minimize theeconomic impact of the rule on hospitals under section 604(a)(5).Since HCFA did not discuss regulatory alternatives in the earlieranalysis, it did not describe the reasons for its approach in thefinal analysis.Sections 607 and 609Section 607 permits agencies, in complying with sections 603 and604, to provide either a quantifiable or numerical description ofthe effects of a rule or more general descriptive statements ifquantification is not practicable or reliable. The analyses issuedwith the proposed and final rules provide quantifiable descriptionsof the rule's impact on covered entities, including ruralhospitals. See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. at 46306 (describing percentchanges in payments per case due to changes in the prospectivepayment system for operating costs).Page 3 GAO/OGC-96-41Finally, section 609(a) requires that agencies ensure that smallentities are given an opportunity to participate in a rulemakingthrough the reasonable use of techniques such as those enumerated.As discussed, HCFA published the full text of its initial analysisas an appendix to the proposed rule and invited comments from smallentities. HCFA staff has advised that it did not take any otheractions specifically designed to ensure participation by smallentities, including rural hospitals, in this rulemaking. However,HCFA staff also pointed out that, in carrying out itsresponsibilities under the Medicare program, HCFA maintains anappropriate ongoing working relationship with industryofficials.(iii) Actions relevant to sections 202-205 of the UnfundedMandates Reform Act of 1995,2 U.S.C.  1532-1535Since the rule does not impose a federal intergovernmental orprivate sector mandate, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates ReformAct of 1995, sections 202, 204 and 205 of the act are inapplicable.Similarly, section 203 of the act is inapplicable because the rulewill not significantly affect small governments.(iv) Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive OrdersAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  551 et seq.With the exception of the matter discussed below, HCFApromulgated the changes to the Medicare prospective payment systemsunder the notice and comment procedures of 5 U.S.C.  553 andsection 1871(b) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395hh(b).4The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on May 31,1996; HCFA stated that it would consider comments received by July31, 1996. The final rule was published on August 30, 1996. HCFAreceived 511 timely pieces of correspondence containing comments onthe proposed rule. See 61 Fed. Reg. at 46167. Those comments arediscussed throughout the preamble to the final rule.In the final rule, HCFA revised certain regulations pertainingto the costs of graduate medical education programs to conform to arecently enacted statute. The agency's 1996 appropriation requiresthat, for certain purposes, the Federal Government "deem accreditedany postgraduate physician training program that would beaccredited but for the accrediting agency's reliance upon anaccreditation standard that requires an entity to perform aninduced abortion or require, provide, or refer for training in theperformance of induced abortions, or make arrangements for suchtraining . . .." See Section 101(d) of Pub. L. No. 104-134, April26, 1996.4Section 1871(b) provides that, with exceptions not pertinenthere, before issuing any final rule, the Secretary shall providefor notice of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register and acomment period of at least 60 days.Page 4 GAO/OGC-96-41HCFA found that notice and comment procedures were unnecessarywith respect to this regulatory change since it did not involve anexercise of agency discretion. See 61 Fed. Reg. at 46224.Accordingly, HCFA did not follow notice and comment procedures withrespect to this provision. See 5 U.S.C.  553(b)(B); 42 U.S.C. 1395hh(b)(2)(C).Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.  3501-3520The rule modifies an existing requirement applicable to allhospitals that provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. Atpresent, hospitals are required to distribute a statement entitled"An Important Message from Medicare"5 to patients at or about thetime of admission. Under the modified requirement, hospitals wouldbe required to distribute the statement "during the course of thehospital stay" rather than at admission. 61 Fed. Reg. at46213-46214. The preambles to the proposed and final rules discussthis modification to the reporting requirement, explaining thereasons for the change and providing a burden estimate. 61 Fed.Reg. at 27490, 27478; 61 Fed. Reg. at 46223, 46213-46214.HCFA solicited and evaluated comments on its modification to thereporting requirement. See 61 Fed. Reg. at 27489-27490. HCFAdeclined to accept the one commenter's suggestion that it requiremass distribution of the "Important Message from Medicare" tobeneficiaries while they are healthy and do not have plans to behospitalized. See 61 Fed. Reg. at 46214.HCFA submitted its proposed modification of this Medicarereporting requirement to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)on July 19, 1996. OMB has not yet approved the modification and thepreambles to the proposed and final rules state that themodification will not be effective until it is approved by OMB. 61Fed. Reg. at 46223; 61 Fed. Reg. at 27490.Statutory Authorization for the ruleBoth the proposed and final rule cite the Secretary's broadauthority to promulgate regulations necessary for the efficientadministration of the Medicare program. See 61 Fed. Reg. at27492-27493, 46224-46225 (citing primarily sections 1102 and 1871of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1302 and 1395hh).65The statement advises patients of their rights to be fullyinformed about decisions affecting their coverage or payment andabout their appeal rights should they be notified that Medicarewill no longer cover their care. 61 Fed. Reg. at 46213-46214.6As discussed above, both sections impose specific proceduralrequirements applicable to the rulemaking at issue here.Page 5 GAO/OGC-96-41In addition, the preambles and appendices to the proposed andfinal rules cite numerous statutory provisions associated withparticular aspects of the rule. For example, section 1886(d)(4)(C)of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395ww(d)(4)(C), requiresthe Secretary to annually adjust the weights and classificationsfor the diagnosis related groups to which Medicare beneficiaries'hospital stays may be assigned. 61 Fed. Reg. at 46167. Section1886(d)(3)(E) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(3)(E), requires that, as part of the methodology fordetermining hospital payments, the Secretary annually makeadjustments for area differences in hospital wage levels by afactor reflecting the relative wage level for hospitals in aparticular geographic area compared to a national average. 61 Fed.Reg. at 46177. See also section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the SocialSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395ww(g)(1)(A) (providing for thepayment of hospitals' capital costs under a prospective paymentsystem established by the Secretary). 61 Fed. Reg. at 46166.Executive Order 12866The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviewed the rule asan economically significant regulatory action under Executive Order12866. HCFA staff advised that after submission of the rule to OMB,HCFA made changes to its discussion of the rule's effective date,which OMB also approved.In its submission, HCFA did not identify any other statute orexecutive order imposing procedural requirements relevant to therule.Page 6 GAO/OGC-96-41
