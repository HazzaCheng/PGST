So that was what it was all about! Yourwriting has no bigger fan than EW, but I must admit to finding some of thelater novels a bit, shall we say, murky . Large & charming party atthe Cineplex Odeon--the young Waldorf Astors, Mr. Balfour, Ld & Lady Elcho,Dcess of Manchester, Lady Essex, &c. &c. All seemed delighted but forpoor Teddy, who ran screaming from the theater during the first reel--hisnerves, no doubt. Miss Bonham Carter was splendid . She ought to playLily Barth if The House of Mirth ever makes it out of turnaround. Is ittrue they're giving the Merchant-Ivory treatment to your Golden Bowl ?Can't say I ever made it quite to the end of that one either.            Have youlooked over the Modern Library list yet? As Scribner authors, neither of us islikely to find much favor in a list of books sold by Mr. Cerf. Still, I fearthat to the younger generation we must represent the literary equivalent oftufted furniture and gas chandeliers. Ulysses , alas, is No. 1. Have youdriven into this fog? It's a turgid welter of pornography (the rudest schoolboykind) & uninformed & unimportant drivel. The ingredients of soup do notmake soup without the cook's intervention. The same goes for Mr. Kerouac.

Of the part that is mine to passover in silence is perhaps the course both of humility and of humilit .That the number of my own works chosen should be trois is a matter forneither protestation nor ingratitude. Yet that such an ordering hardly inducesin the author of the aforementioned trois such satisfaction as might behoped to accrue to one looking down with Olympian detachment from beyond thevale of longevity is a statement the validity of which cannot be called readilyinto question. It is unlikely to fail to play upon the suspicions of such a onethat the composition of his most highly esteemed should be that most latelyconverted into a wan cinematic confection of fretsome abbreviation. Neither,however, could a figure such as he neglect the observation that the personagewith whom the former is now abstractly in conversation was accorded the meritof only dues livres , and that those due were accorded a positionmore terrestrial, which is to say well below those of the former on the "list."Such a "point," once made, could not resist the tendency to instill feelings of"envy" and ressentiment on the part of an author perhaps bettercompensated and perhaps more "popular," but in the view of the criticalintelligence--if any such fitful and discredited light may still be conceivedas being within our sphere--not really as good as mine. Thus it is anexpression of both discretion and a great humble reverence for the feelings ofothers to leave such a "point" unmade and unwinced at.            Though itmay be additionally unpenworthy, there is another "point" that heavily impelsmaking . It is that of all the volumes, some eminent, some too muchesteemed in the trail of "fashion," there is one included that so transgressesthe hesitational boundary of propriety as to induce a feeling of stammeringdyspepsia. Attention is called to the uncouth Mr. Roth, whose effluviations areso juvenalianly unspeakable that I cannot bear to utter their "title." Thiswork , it cannot be refrained from being pointed out, has as its chieftopic that exercise that in our own great palmy day was considered least worthyof writerly elucidation. That this basely erotic occupation that was to our owncontemporaries so unsupportable should form the core of the work inquestion might be thought to constitute a disqualification. To such vulgariandepths does this "fascination" descend that there is in one place depicted anact of rank unsalubrious congress between him and a comestible whoseingestion by familial others is ineluctably and tenebrously foreordained. Ispeak here of the "liver" scene. For a work whose "climax" depends on feelingsof the most passionate revulsion to be esteemed ahead of your own labors, sofar superior as to be undeserving of inclusion in the same tormented sentence,is, my dearest Edith, an insult insufferable to all whose reverence forliterature anglais is to be warranted. To commiserate against so greatand gaping an injustice presents itself as a course of action perhaps lessunwise than others.

I have a place down there in Key West. It's a smallplace but a good place. There are cats and a lot of rain and when it rains thecats all come inside the house. The biggest cat is named Hem. There are somesmaller cats, too, with names like "Scott" and "Sherwood" and "Dos." The bigcat is bigger than the others and also braver and probably a better writer. Butsome people who don't know any better think the little cats are pretty cute.One day I'll put them in a bag and drown them in the river for their owngood.            In Florida the cats drinkmilk, but we humans all drink rum. It's not very good rum, but in Florida rumis the drink to drink so we drink it. Sometimes we mix the rum with Coke andsometimes we don't mix it with anything, depending on how thirsty we are. Rumand Coke is a good drink, but not if you're thirsty. If you're thirsty, youwant water, but never Rum and Coke. Here's 400 bucks. You can pay me when yousee me, unless I see you first.            Hell, youwere saying something about a list. I couldn't quite make out what you weresaying, but I knew it was about a list. Scott, a list is a fine thing if you'reyoung, and you're high up on it. But when you're a little older and not so highup you see that the list is just a list and that's all it is.

I'm not giving it another moment's thought on account of I'm toobusy writing my novels, and if somebody wants to read one of them instead ofsipping a whisky highball and kicking back in an Adirondack chair or aneight-dollar swivel chair or a pig iron porch swing covered in fifty-centMontgomery Ward paint from a paintcan he keeps on a ledge in the fallingdownbarn where his people have been begetting quadroons and octaroons andsixteentharoons and thirtysecondaroons since the time before they thought towrite it down, that's nobody's business but his own.

Mailer is Hemingwayon a tight budget.

Once, when he was younger, he had read Faulkner'sAs I Lay Dying cover to cover. Privately, he had found it a bitconfusing. Why was the mother a fish? But he knew that people thought it was afine novel, and he resented that he hadn't written it himself. Faulkner was aSoutherner, probably a racist, and hard to understand. Mailer was a Jewish NewYorker, beloved by black people, and a comparatively easy read (not to mentiona fine lay). Still, Mailer thought, Faulkner and Mailer were a lot alike. Bothwere great American writers--between them they had written many of the best 100novels of the 20 th century. Both drank, heavily at times; liked toget paid for what they wrote; and had contempt for lesser talents. Mailerthought Faulkner thought highly of Mailer as well--maybe as highly as Mailerdid himself.            Mailer had sent Faulknerevery book he had ever written, all with flattering inscriptions, and neverreceived so much as a thank-you. Mailer suspected that Faulkner had read themall and wished he had written them himself. Possibly, Faulkner had never somuch as looked at them. He had heard somewhere that Faulkner had died. Still,Mailer was irked. He felt that it had all been a big literary game. Mailer wasnot a critic of Southern literature, but he privately wondered whetherposterity might not judge John Jakes a better novelist than Faulkner, sourcesclose to Mailer tell Mailer.            So to be called Hemingway ona budget by Faulkner made Mailer angry. It made Mailer very, very angry. Soangry did Mailer become that Mailer took the big picture of Faulkner that hangsover Mailer's desk and smashed it into a million pieces. After he did that,there were just pictures of Mailer hanging there. Mailer recognized that thisreaction was not very mature, but Mailer had bigger things to worry about thanminding his literary manners. Mailer didn't understand why people were treatinghim like a dead writer, either. Just recently, Mailer had published hisautobiography and a book about Jesus. Mailer had the inspired idea to combinethe two subjects in one book. Bill Faulkner never had an idea that good, or ifhe did, no one could understand it.            Mailerthought to himself that next time he saw Faulkner, he would probably sock himone in the kisser. No, Mailer thought, the next time he ran into Faulkner at aswanky literary party, he would return Faulkner's insult with his usual wittyinsouciance. Mailer hated those parties, but he hardly ever missed one. "Yourbooks stink," Mailer imagined himself saying. "Mailer can't understand a wordof them."            ******                           From:dharmabum@nirvana.net To: mailer@daemon.com;listserv@deadauthorsguild.org Cc: beats@evillage.com Re: On thelist            Norm,            Easy on the benzedrine, man.Me, I was just pleased to be on that list with famouswriters like Paul Bowlesand William Golding. That cat Saul Bellow was on there too. It made me thinkabout the time Neal and I went to see him in Chicago in 1949.            I came in by Greyhoundbusfrom Milwaukee. It was an ordinary Greyhoudbus with runaways and oldfolk andthe Greyhoundbusdriver in his Greyhoundbusdriver's cap not saying much ofanything but just driving the bus toward Chi. Neal didn't have the busfare sohe hotwired a car, not to steal it, but just to ride ride ride for the thrillof it like some magnificent highflying parkpigeon. Along the way, Neal hadmarried or maybe just kidnapped a Scandinavian-extracted girl from Kenoshanamed Inga. Inga had blond curls and beefy arms like a stevedore and wasexcited about seeing the bigcity but said she wanted to go home and was goingto call the police if he didn't take her. Neal should have been worried aboutInga being jailbait but at that point he was pretty focused on medievalliterature, and kept on reciting passages from Chaucer and El Cid andtalking about how Giotto was a better painter than Van Gogh, nokidding.            We were crashing at a coldwater flat on the South side with a guy called Phil and Phil's aunt and herchihuahuas. The chihuahuas had been shaved real close to the skin, so therewasn't much to them, just a lot of pointy ears and dogyapping. They must havebeen pretty cold in those Chi winters and when they were hungry they'd claw atyour shins. Neal wanted to invite Sanchez and Marylou and Freddie Engels overfor a sexorgy but Dave's aunt was out of chihuahuafood, so before we could dothat, we had to get something for the dogs to eat.            As soon as we stepped outsidePhil's aunt's apartment, a cruiser spotted us and tailed after us at a slowcrawl down the street. Neal had ditched his freebuick, but apparently we lookedlike some hipsters who had pulled off a jewelry heist downtown. They didn'tstop us on suspicion, but just kept tailing us at a distance which made ustwitchy since Inga kept saying she was going to turn us in for being hopheadsand whiteslavers and a lot of other stuff I couldn't understand because it wasin Swedish. We knew they were cops because they had copuniforms and weredriving a copcar. So we stopped in a dark dingy old South side tavern to thinkover our plans and have some coldbeers.            When wecame out of there, Inga had split and we realized we were on Congress Street.Congress Street shoots out West for an amazing distance, which is where we wereheaded, so we hijacked a lettuce rig, pistol-whipped the driver, wham, and madestraight for Joliet. As we were riding through the sweetsmelling Americannight, Neal looked up from the book he was reading, Les aventures de ladialectique , by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, which he had lifted from thephilosophy section of Kroch's & Brentano's in the Loop. He turned to me andthe driver of the rig who was wearing a lettucepicking outfit and a redbandanna tied around his mouth and said, "Oh man, we completely forgot to gosee Saul Bellow." And now we're all on the same list of goodbooks. I'msohappy.

My dear Mr Kerouac,            Yes, of course I too ampleased to be on the list. All these last several decades I have beenoverwhelmed with feelings of horror & despair; annihilation; nothingness;barrenness & void. One could say that I have been in a poor mood. For Tothe Lighthouse to place fifteenth provides a moment of cheer, for it provesthat someone has indeed read to the end of it.            But a moment of cheer quicklypasses. What after all is a list? A hundred books; perhaps seventy-five;perhaps only fifty. The end of each arrives, and soon another book ispublished, a book is reviewed, more books appear. List succeeds list. Liststurn into libraries. Some of these books are borrowed from the libraries. Thesebooks seethe with plots; with characters; with life & suspense. In otherbooks, little occurs. A group of persons goes somewhere; or does not gosomewhere; or contemplates going somewhere but delays the decision aboutwhether to go. The words fly past; two hundred words; six hundred words; onethousand five hundred words; two thousand words. The words turn into pages: onehundred pages; two hundred pages; three hundred pages; four hundred pages. Thealphabet is recounted. B follows A. D is preceded by C; then comes E; then F;then G; then H; then I. If L could be reached, that would be something. But Lis very hard to attain; very few people in the whole of England ever attain L.Not many even get so far as K. And what of M, and the murky letters whichfollow M, which include U, R and W? Who can even speak of W, which shimmers atthe North end of the alphabet, scarcely visible from D. When I think of D, animage comes into my head that I am powerless to resist: it is the cross sectionof a mackerel.            Pleaseforgive my digression--what else can one call it, except perhaps"maundering"--which has made me forget entirely what I had been about to tellyou! It is nothing of importance! Perhaps something about Vanessa; or Lytton;or Vita; or Lady Ottoline; or Maynard, who as I write pursues Duncan around thegarden with lust in his heart & a croquet mallet. Such gossip pales besidethis "maundering," this reverie for which I am intensely thankful; for nothingso solaces me, calms me in the perplexity of life, and miraculously raises itsburdens, as this sublime power, this divine talent for writing endlessly abouthardly anything at all, & one should no more interrupt it, while it laststhan one should break the crockery in one's home and leave the shards lying onthe kitchen floor for no reason. Though yes, I have done that at times aswell.            Write if youfind work, V
