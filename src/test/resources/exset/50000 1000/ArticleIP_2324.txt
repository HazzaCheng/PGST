                                 The Flytrap Blame Game            One of the few truthsuniversally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary BettyCurrie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into ascandal she had nothing to do with.            But does Currie deserve suchsanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her jobthen enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckoldedhis wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did sheprotest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie maynot be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that theAmerican public believes her to be.            TheCurrie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.            Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically lowapproval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged herfavorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce amarried man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequentlyand insouciantly, and blab her "secret" affair to anyone who'd listen. But shewas also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputationsmeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her "friend" Linda Tripp. Shehardly deserves such universal contempt.            Others besides Currie havebenefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos hasbecome a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courageto turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacksof hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to "discover" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying,womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back thenStephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton'slying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kausfirst noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this "Chatterbox" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universalgood, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at themoment Clinton's stock was about to plunge.            (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp'sallies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family,and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly toimprove her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.)            Below is                   Slate               's entirescorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to+10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anythingabove zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science.How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clintondefenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than TheGuys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage aplus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.)
