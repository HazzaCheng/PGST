Letter from John Cassidy                        Paul Krugman replies to John Cassidy                                       Letter from M. Mitchell Waldrop                        Paul Krugman replies to M. Mitchell Waldrop                                       Letter from Kenneth J. Arrow                                       Letter from Ted C. Fishman                                       DavidWarsh's July 3, 1994, Boston Globe                                                                        Letter from John Cassidy:                                       Paul Krugman loves to beratejournalists for their ignorance of economics, particularly his economics, buton this occasion, I fear, his logic is more addled than usual. I am reluctantto dignify his hatchet job with a lengthy reply, but some of his claims are sodefamatory that they should be addressed, if only for the record.            1) Krugman claims that myopening sentence--"In a way, Bill Gates's current troubles with the JusticeDepartment grew out of an economics seminar that took place thirteen years ago,at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government"--is "pure fiction." Perhapsso, but in that case somebody should tell this to Joel Klein, the assistantattorney general in charge of the antitrust division. When I interviewed Kleinfor my piece about the Microsoft case, he singled out Brian Arthur as theeconomist who has most influenced his thinking about the way in whichhigh-technology markets operate. It was Klein's words, not those of Arthur,that prompted me to use Arthur in the lead of the story.            2) Krugman wrote: "Cassidy'sarticle tells the story of how Stanford Professor Brian Arthur came up with theidea of increasing returns." I wrote no such thing, and Arthur has never, to myknowledge, claimed any such thing. The notion of increasing returns has beenaround since Adam Smith, and it was written about at length by Alfred Marshallin 1890. What I did say in my article was that increasing returns was largelyignored by mainstream economists for much of the postwar era, a claim thatsimply isn't controversial. (As Krugman notes, one reason for this wastechnical, not ideological. Allowing for the possibility of increasing returnstends to rob economic models of two properties that economists cherish:simplicity and determinism. As long ago as 1939, Sir John Hicks, one of thefounders of modern economics, noted that increasing returns, if tolerated,could lead to the "wreckage" of a large part of economic theory.)            3) Pace Krugman, Ialso did not claim that Arthur bears principal responsibility for therediscovery of increasing returns by economists in the 1970s and 1980s. AsKrugman notes, several scholars (himself included) who were working in thefields of game theory and international trade published articles incorporatingincreasing returns before Arthur did. My claim was simply that Arthur appliedincreasing returns to high-technology markets, and that his work influenced howother economists and government officials think about these markets. Krugmanapart, virtually every economist I have spoken to, including Daniel Rubinfeld,a former Berkeley professor who is now the chief economist at the JusticeDepartment's antitrust division, told me this was the case. (Rubinfeld alsomentioned several other economists who did influential work, and I cited threeof them in the article.)            4) Krugman appears tosuggest that I made up some quotes, a charge that, if it came from a moreobjective source, I would consider to be a serious matter. In effect, he isaccusing Brian Arthur, a man he calls a "nice guy," of being a fabricator or aliar. The quotes in question came from Arthur, and they were based on hisrecollections of two meetings that he attended some years ago. After Krugman'sarticle appeared, the Santa Fe professor called me to say that he stillrecalled the meetings in question as I described them. Krugman, as he admits,wasn't present at either of the meetings.            5) For a man who takes hisown cogitations extremely seriously, Krugman is remarkably cavalier aboutattributing motives and beliefs to others. "Cassidy has made it clear inearlier writing that he does not like mainstream economists, and he may havebeen overly eager to accept a story that puts them in a bad light," hepronounces. I presume this statement refers to a critical piece I wrote in 1996about the direction that economic research, principally macroeconomic research,has taken over the past two decades. In response to that article, I receiveddozens of messages of appreciation from mainstream economists, including fromtwo former presidents of the American Economic Association. Among the sourcesquoted in that piece were the then-chairman of the White House Council ofEconomic Advisers (Joseph Stiglitz), a governor of the Federal Reserve Board(Laurence Meyer), and a well-known Harvard professor (Gregory Mankiw). Toclaim, as Krugman does, that I "don't like mainstream economists" and that I amout to denigrate their work is malicious hogwash. The fact of the matter isthat I spend much of my life reading the work of mainstream economists,speaking to them, and trying to find something they have written that mightinterest the general public. In my experience, most economists appreciate theattention.            6) Imight attach more weight to Krugman's criticisms if I hadn't recently rereadhis informative 1994 book Peddling Prosperity , in which he devotes achapter to the rediscovery of increasing returns by contemporary economists.Who are the first scholars Krugman mentions in his account? Paul David, aneconomic historian who wrote a famous paper about how the QWERTYUIOP typewriterkeyboard evolved and, you guessed it, Brian Arthur. "Why QWERTYUIOP?" Krugmanwrote. "In the early 1980s, Paul David and his Stanford colleague Brian Arthurasked that question, and quickly realized that it led them into surprisinglydeep waters. ... What Paul David, Brian Arthur, and a growing number of othereconomists began to realize in the late seventies and early eighties was thatstories like that of the typewriter keyboard are, in fact, pervasive in theeconomy." Evidently, Krugman felt four years ago that Arthur's contribution wasimportant enough to merit a prominent mention in his book. Now, he dismissesthe same work, saying it "didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know."Doubtless, this change in attitude on Krugman's part is unconnected to the factthat Arthur has started to receive some public recognition. The eminent MITprofessor, whose early academic work received widespread media attention, isfar too generous a scholar to succumb to such pettiness.                           --John Cassidy                                                         Paul Krugman replies to JohnCassidy:                                       I think that David Warsh's1994 in the Boston                Globe says it all. If other journalists woulddo as much homework as he did, I wouldn't have had to write that article.                                             Letter from M. Mitchell Waldrop:                                       Thanks to Paul Krugman forhis lament about credulous reporters who refuse to let facts stand in the wayof a good story ("TheLegend of Arthur"). As a professional journalist, I found his points welltaken--even when he cites my own book, Complexity as a classic exampleof the gullibility genre.            Among many other things,Complexity tells the story of the Irish-born economist Brian Arthur andhow he came to champion a principle known as "increasing returns." The recentNew Yorker article explains how that principle has since become theintellectual foundation of the Clinton administration's antitrust case againstMicrosoft. Krugman's complaint is that the popular press--includingComplexity and The New Yorker --is now hailing Brian Arthur as theoriginator of increasing returns, even though Krugman and many others hadworked on the idea long before Arthur did.            I leave itfor others to decide whether I was too gullible in writing Complexity .For the record, however, I would like to inject a few facts into Krugman'sstory, which he summarizes nicely in the final paragraph:            When Waldrop's book cameout, I wrote him as politely as I could, asking exactly how he had managed tocome up with his version of events. He did, to his credit, write back. Heexplained that while he had become aware of some other people working onincreasing returns, trying to put them in would have pulled his story line outof shape. ... So what we really learn from the legend of Arthur is that somejournalists like a good story too much to find out whether it is reallytrue.            Now, I will admit to manysins, not the least of them being a profound ignorance of graduate-leveleconomics; I spent my graduate-school career in the physics department instead,writing a Ph.D. dissertation on the quantum-field theory of elementary particlecollisions at relativistic energies. However, I am not so ignorant of thecanons of journalism (and of common sense) that I would take a plausible fellowlike Brian Arthur at face value without checking up on him. During my researchfor Complexity I spoke to a number of economists about his work,including Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, co-creator of the General EquilibriumTheory of economics that Brian so eloquently criticizes. They generally agreedthat Brian was a maverick in the field--and perhaps a bit too much in love withhis own self-image as a misunderstood outsider--but basically sound. None ofthem warned me that he was usurping credit where credit was not due.            Which brings me to ProfessorKrugman's letter, and my reply. I remember the exchange very well. Obviously,however, my reply failed to make clear what I was really trying to say. So I'lltry again:            a) During our interviews,Brian went out of his way to impress upon me that many other economists haddone work in increasing returns--Paul Krugman among them. He was anxious thatthey be given due credit in anything I wrote. So was I.            b) Accordingly, I included apassage in Complexity in which Brian does indeed describe what othershad done in the field--Paul Krugman among them. Elsewhere in that same chapter,I tried to make it clear that the concept of increasing returns was alreadywell known to Brian's professors at Berkeley, where he first learned of it.Indeed, I quote Brian pointing out that increasing returns had been extensivelydiscussed by the great English economist Alfred Marshall in 1891.            c) So, when I receivedKrugman's letter shortly after Complexity came out, I was puzzled: Hewas complaining that I hadn't referenced others in the increasing-returnsfield--Paul Krugman among them--although I had explicitly done so.            d) But, when I checked thepublished text, I was chagrined to discover that the critical passagementioning Krugman wasn't there.            e) Only then did I realizewhat had happened. After I had submitted the manuscript, my editor at Simon& Schuster had suggested a number of cuts to streamline what was already along and involved chapter on Brian's ideas. I accepted some of the cuts, andrestored others--including (I thought) the passage that mentioned Krugman. Inthe rush to get Complexity to press, however, that passage somehow woundup on the cutting-room floor anyway, and I didn't notice until too late.            Thatoversight was my fault entirely, not my editor's, and certainly not BrianArthur's. I take full responsibility, I regret it, and--if Simon & Schusteronly published an errata column--I would happily correct it publicly. However,contrary to what Professor Krugman implies, it was an oversight, not a breezydisregard of facts for the sake of a good story.                           --M. MitchellWaldrop Washington                                             Paul Krugman replies to M. MitchellWaldrop:                                       I am truly sorry that TheNew Yorker has not yet established a Web presence so that we could includea link directly to the Cassidy piece. However, you can get a pretty good ideaof what the piece said by reading the summary of it presented in "Tasty Bitsfrom the Technology Front." Cassidy did not present a story about one guyamong many who worked on increasing returns. On the contrary: He presented amorality play in which a lonely hero struggled to make his ideas heard againstthe unified opposition of a narrow-minded profession both intellectually andpolitically conservative. As TBTF's host--not exactly a naive reader--put it,"These ideas were anathema to mainstream economists in 1984 when Arthur firsttried to publish them."            That morality play--not thequestion of who deserves credit--was the main point of my column, because it isa pure (and malicious) fantasy that has nonetheless become part of the storyline people tell about increasing returns and its relationship to mainstreameconomics.            The fact, which is easilydocumented, is that during the years that, according to the legend, increasingreturns was unacceptable in mainstream economics, papers about increasingreturns were in fact being cheerfully published by all the major journals. Andas I pointed out in the chronology I provided with the article, even standardreference volumes like the Handbook of International Economics(published in 1984, the year Arthur supposedly met a blank wall of resistance)have long contained chapters on increasing returns. Whatever the reason thatArthur had trouble getting his own paper published, ideological rigidity hadnothing to do with it.            How did this fantasy come tobe so widely believed? I am glad to hear that you tried to tell a more balancedstory, Mr. Waldrop, even if sloppy paperwork kept it from seeing the light ofday. And I am glad that you talked to Ken Arrow. But Nobel laureates, who havewide responsibilities and much on their mind, are not necessarily on top ofwhat has been going on in research outside their usual field. I happen to knowof one laureate who, circa 1991, was quite unaware that anyone had thoughtabout increasing returns in either growth or trade. Did you try talking toanyone else--say, to one of the economists who are the straight men in thestories you tell? For example, your book starts with the story of Arthur'smeeting in 1987 with Al Fishlow at Berkeley, in which Fishlow supposedly said,"We know that increasing returns can't exist"--and Arthur went away in despairover the unwillingness of economists to think the unthinkable. Did you callFishlow to ask whether he said it, and what he meant? Since by 1987 PaulRomer's 1986 papers on increasing returns and growth had started an avalancheof derivative work, he was certainly joking--what he probably meant was "Oh no,not you too." And let me say that I simply cannot believe that you could havetalked about increasing returns with any significant number of economistsoutside Santa Fe without Romer's name popping up in the first 30 seconds ofevery conversation--unless you were very selective about whom you talked to.And oh, by the way, there are such things as libraries, where you can browseactual economics journals and see what they contain.            The point is that it's notjust a matter of failing to cite a few more people. Your book, like the Cassidyarticle, didn't just tell the story of Brian Arthur; it also painted a pictureof the economics profession, its intellectual bigotry and prejudice, whichhappens to be a complete fabrication (with some real, named people cast asvillains) that somehow someone managed to sell you. I wonder who?            Even more to the point: Howdid Cassidy come by his story? Is it possible that he completely misunderstoodwhat Brian Arthur was saying--that the whole business about the seminar atHarvard where nobody would accept increasing returns, about the lonely struggleof Arthur in the face of ideological rigidity, even the quotation from Arthurabout economists being unwilling to consider the possibility of imperfectmarkets because of the Cold War (give me a break!) were all in Cassidy'simagination?            Let me say that I amactually quite grateful to Cassidy and The New Yorker . A number ofpeople have long been furious about your book--for example, Victor Norman, whomyou portrayed as the first of many economists too dumb or perhaps narrow-mindedto understand Arthur's brilliant innovation. Norman e-mailed me to say that "Ihave read the tales from the Vienna woods before and had hoped that it could becleared up by someone at some point." Yet up to now there was nothing anyonecould do about the situation. The trouble was that while "heroic rebel defiesorthodoxy" is a story so good that nobody even tries to check it out, "guymakes minor contribution to well-established field, proclaims himself itsfounder" is so boring as to be unpublishable. (David Warsh's 1994 series ofcolumns in the Boston Globe on the increasing-returns revolution ineconomics, the basis for a forthcoming book from Harvard University Press, isfar and away the best reporting on the subject, did include a sympathetic butdevastating expos of Arthur's pretensions--but to little effect. [Click toread Warsh on Arthur.]) Only now did I have a publishable story: "guy makesminor contribution to well-established field, portrays himself as heroicrebel--and The New Yorker believes him."            Thankyou, Mr. Cassidy.                                             Letter from Kenneth J. Arrow:                                       Paul Krugman's attack onBrian Arthur ("TheLegend of Arthur") requires a correction of its misrepresentations of fact.Arthur is a reputable and significant scholar whose work is indeed havinginfluence in the field of industrial organization and in particular publicpolicy toward antitrust policy in high-tech industries. Krugman admits that hewrote the article because he was "just pissed off," not a very good state for ajudicious statement of facts, as his column shows.            His theme is stated in hisfirst paragraph: "Cassidy's article [in The New Yorker of Jan. 12] tells thestory of how Stanford Professor Brian Arthur came up with the idea ofincreasing returns." Cassidy, however, said nothing of the sort. The concept ofincreasing returns is indeed very old, and Cassidy at no point attributed thatidea to Arthur. Indeed, the phrase "increasing returns" appears just once inCassidy's article and then merely to say that Arthur had used the term whileothers refer to network externalities. Further, Arthur has never made any suchpreposterous claim at any other time. On the contrary, his papers have fullycited the history of the field and made references to the previous papers,including those of Paul Krugman. (See Arthur's papers collected in the volumeIncreasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy, especially his prefaceand my foreword for longer comments on Arthur's work in historic perspective.Click to see the foreword.) Hence, Krugman's whole attack is directed at astatement made neither by Arthur nor by Cassidy. Krugman has not read Cassidy'spiece with any care nor has he bothered to review what Arthur has in factsaid.            What Cassidy in fact did inhis article was to trace a line of influence between one of Arthur's earlyarticles and the current claims of the Department of Justice against Microsoft.It appears that Cassidy based his article on several interviews, not justone.            The point that Arthur hasemphasized and which is influential in the current debates about antitrustpolicy is the dynamic implication of increasing returns. It is the concept ofpath-dependence, that small events, whether random or the result of corporatestrategic choice, may have large consequences because of increasing returns ofvarious kinds. Initial small advantages become magnified, for example, bycreating a large installed base, and direct the future, possibly in aninefficient direction. Techniques of production may be locked in at an earlystage. Similar considerations apply to regional development and learning.                           --Kenneth J.Arrow Nobel laureate and Joan Kenney professor of economics emeritusStanford University                                             Letter from Ted C. Fishman:                                       Afterreading Paul Krugman vent his spleen against fellow economist Brian Arthur in"The Legend ofArthur," I couldn't help wondering whose reputation he was out to trash,Arthur's or his own. Krugman seems to fear a plot to deny economists theirintellectual due. If one exists, Arthur is not a likely suspect. In a series oflong interviews with me a year ago (for Worth magazine), I tried, vainly, toget Arthur to tell me how his ideas about increasing returns have encouraged anew strain of economic investigations. Despite much prodding, Arthur obligedonly by placing himself in a long line of theorists dating back to Adam Smithand Alfred Marshall. I also found him disarmingly generous in giving credit tothe biologists, physicists, and fellow economists who have helped advance hisown thinking. Savvy to the journalist's quest for heroes, Arthur urged me tofocus on his ideas, not his rank among his peers. Krugman has made a career outof telling other economists to pay better attention to the facts, yet as achronicler of Arthur's career and inner life, Krugman seems to have listenedonly to his own demons.                           --Ted C.Fishman                                                         (Foradditional background on the history of "increasing returns" and Brian Arthur'sstanding in the field, click for David Warsh's July 3, 1994,                               BostonGlobe                                  article on Brian Arthur)
