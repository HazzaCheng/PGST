Rx: Takea Brill Pill, and Call Me in the Morning                        In response to "Brill,Mote, and Beam": Much of the criticism of the "Pressgate" piece and themagazine in general has been from people in the mainstream media who wereclearly part of the system I was writing about and, thus, respondedaccordingly. Because                   Slate                and Jacob Weisberg don't in any wayfall into that category and deserve to be taken seriously, I thought I shouldtry to respond seriously to some of the factual stuff. (I'll let readers decidefor themselves if the magazine is "boring," a knock that reminds me of lawyers'wishful thinking when I started the American Lawyer .)            First, I didn't "leak" thepiece to the New York Times --a semi-important point for a magazine likeours. We blast faxed the piece to every major (and minor, I think) pressorganization, after first faxing it to Kenneth Starr. Everybody got it at thesame time. So, the Times ' decision to put it on the front page was notbased on having any kind of exclusive.            Now to take Jacob's pointsin order:            l) Whether I prove Starrleaked grand jury information depends on one's definition of grand juryinformation. I used the one used by the relevant court with jurisdiction. Starrdisagrees with that. No mistakes? How about the stained dress? Or the presidenttestifying that he never was alone with Lewinsky? (I never say the Timesmade mistakes, by the way.)            2) Yes, Sue Schmidt disputesthat quote. That happens with reporters a lot. But, interestingly, she didn'tdispute it the first time she was asked about the story--by Howie Kurtz for hisfirst story. My notes have her saying exactly that and then saying it againlater on in our interview (at the Madison Hotel coffee shop) in almost the samelanguage.            3) No self-contradictionhere. She volunteered that item about Jordan and where she had got the story inthe course of narrating that first weekend of the "scandal." When I later askedher directly about sources for her first-day story (and stories beyond that)she declined to comment.            4) My point was thatLewinsky's "No" answer was the thing that stood out the most to Mike Isikoffwhen I talked with him about the tapes. And it's a big part of whyNewsweek held the story. I simply pointed out that this is somethingNewsweek might have remembered to put in and quote when it went onlinewith its first story. In retrospect, though, it would have been fairer andfuller to note that Newsweek did, indeed, say the evidence was not atall clear that the president had instructed her to lie. Nonetheless, I thinkNewsweek should have included this important quote if it had wanted tobe fair.            5) To take one example,let's look at the first-day reports from the networks.            What did I know? a) Starr'stop deputy had spent "much of the day" briefing these people. Starr told methat, and Bennett confirmed it but would not tell me specifics. b) The networkreports included material from tapes that could only be the tapes that Starr'speople had made (because these tapes allegedly have Lewinsky saying that Jordanand the president told her to lie--which was not on the tapes Newsweekheard, and Newsweek had supposedly heard the most incriminating tapes).Neither Tripp's lawyers nor anyone else (even Tripp, though she might obviouslyremember what was on them--but she was not accessible to the press at thispoint) could have heard those tapes or briefed reporters about them. So I don'tthink it's "intellectually dishonest" to say that this information must havecome from Starr's office. Remember: He says his guy briefed them for thesereports, and the crux of the reports was what was supposedly on thesetapes.            By the way, this criticismis kind of refreshing in the sense that it's so different from the "everyoneknows prosecutors leak" criticism that I've got.            6) Jacob is just plainwrong. There are no court decisions in the relevant jurisdiction that supportStarr on the notion that leaking what people tell investigators before theytestify about what they will testify to is OK. Sure, there are some from othercourts elsewhere, but they are few and far between, and Starr really wouldn'tbe able to cite them properly in a brief in the District of Columbia.            7) Oops, forget my lastparagraph under Point 5.            8) My point about anonymousquotes is made by Jacob. I'm against totally blind uses of phrases such as"sources" that don't say how many sources or what ax they might have to grind.(Example: Jackie Judd's citing of "several sources" to substantiate herwitnesses-interrupted-the-president-and-Lewinsky "scoop.") When a source can'tbe named, enough identification should be supplied so that the reader knows thesource's potential bias. This clearly worked here; Jacob can see that I'm usinga Times person as the source and correctly identifies the potentialbias. Now, go back and read my description of all the truly blind "sources" inthe article, and see if you can tell the difference.            9) Conflict: Yes, I shouldhave disclosed that in 1995 I gave 1,000 bucks to the Clinton campaign. (I'vealso given money to Republicans, like Rudy.) But how could I prohibit anyone,even myself, retroactively from making contributions? That was 1995; this is1998, and since I sent out the initial direct mail for this magazine (which Iknew would cover political stuff and politicians), I haven't made anycontributions to anyone, let alone the president (to whom, again, I made onecontribution in 1995). The only "political" writing or editing I did around thetime of that Clinton contribution was the Paula Jones piece by Stuart Taylor inthe American Lawyer , which I instigated and edited and proudlypublished--and which, as you know, made the case against the president.            I'm proudof our magazine and proud of this piece. Prouder, in fact, now than when wepublished it, because nearly two weeks later everyone who could take a shot atit has, and so far I can see that I've misspelled one name, screwed up onesequence (the Journal decided not to wait for comment from the WhiteHouse on its incorrect steward-witness story after hearing the WhiteHouse wanted a half-hour to comment, not before), and included two or threegratuitous adjectives that I now wouldn't. There may be more, and if there is Iwill be the first to concede it. But I hope my willingness to admit mistakesisn't misread as being so much more fallible than others--but only being morewilling to admit it.            -- Steve BrillBrill'sContent New York City                                             JacobWeisberg responds: I appreciate the tone of Brill's letter, which is nicerthan my piece was. Several of his points, however, demand a reply.                                       1(a) My criticism stands.The only thing that's clearly illegal is leaking out of the grand jury room.Brill doesn't prove that Starr has done that.                                       1(b) I didn't say therewere "no mistakes." I wrote that Brill didn't document any significant error offact by the Post , Times , Time , or Newsweek . Hedoesn't.                                       2) If Brill used a taperecorder, we'd know whether he misquoted Susan Schmidt or not. He doesn'trespond to the complaint that he misquoted Jonah Goldberg.                                       3) Still a contradictionin the article. It would have been consistent if Brill had written that Schmidtdeclined comment on her sources except for the one she revealed.                                       4) This is now a point ofsupernuance, not a major criticism of Newsweek 's journalistic integrity,which was how it was billed in the story.                                       5) I strongly suspectthat Starr was the source for stories about what various witnesses have said.But there's at least a plausible alternative explanation for where much of thisinformation could have come from. As I say, it would have been only fair tomention it.                                       6) This whole argumentabout the "relevant jurisdiction" is new since Brill's article. Eventually thequestion of what's illegal is likely to be settled by the Supreme Court, whichwill consider lower court precedents from various jurisdictions.                                       7) Brill concedes, Ithink.                                       8) Weisbergconcedes.                                       9) Brillconcedes.                                       10)Brill concedes.                                       RightBack at Ya                        The June 23 "Chatterbox" claims that "a kind of machinery" is at work on theright "that doesn't exist on the left today." Actually, similar machinery hasexisted on the left for years. It runs from the liberals in Congress to theliberals in the statehouse to the liberals on the bench to the liberals on thenightly news. President Clinton plugged into the machinery the moment he waselected.            Examples include theuniversal use of accepted terms such as "extreme right" to describe any givenidea that emanates from the conservative end of the spectrum. It includes broadopposition to the slightest bit of reform that might impact the access of triallawyers to the money machine of our tort system. It includes attack dogopposition to any and all school reform that does not result in massive amountsof additional money for the teachers' unions. And so on and so on.            The lefthas for years started opposing things in tandem the moment the handwritingappeared on the wall. Their opposition has always included near uniformity,right down to verbiage. The Sotomayor nomination is an isolated example ofconservatives employing this often successful tool perfected by the left.            -- David C.Klug Harrisburg, Pa.                           RememberWho Lost the World Cup!                        I read with interest"Hegemon and Proudof It," by Strobe Talbott. However--and you may choose to call me a smugforeigner who is also sensitive to "smugness" on the part of the superpower--Ithought it self-congratulatory, ill-considered, and decidedly anecdotal.            It is certainly true thatthe United States is the most powerful country in the world. It is also truethat its erstwhile rival has collapsed rather utterly. However, even the merestglance at the history books will reveal that Talbott's dominate-but-cooperatescenario has been played out over hundreds of years: The wars were always theexceptions. It is also worth pointing out that the United States has actuallydeclined in relative economic importance since World War II.            In 1950, the United Stateswas responsible for nearly half the gross world product. However, today, eventhough the United States is far and away the No. 1 economy, the European Union,with its 15 member states, actually has a bigger share of the gross worldproduct. Never mind Japan and Asia, who aren't exactly inconsequential. Thenthere's the rest of the world.            It seemsto me that the world as a whole is an awful lot more interdependent than itever has been. And I think that's a good thing. So, like, get over the Americanomnipotence thing.            -- AlanMcGinty London                           FictionalJournalism 101                        Hats offto Michael Kinsley for "Fictional Journalism for Dummies."

Allen's"Living in aSecond-Best World": Five years ago, I paid between 20 cents and 40 cents aminute for long-distance service, depending on the time of day. Now I pay 9.9cents per minute, day or night. In real terms, average airline coach fares areabout half what they were 20 years ago, before deregulation.            I own a business that spendsseveral thousand dollars a year on long-distance phone service and airlinetravel. Sure, finding the lowest rates/fares is more of a hassle now than itonce was, and the service may or may not be better, but to me, this is easilyworth putting up with to get the cost saving.            Allen maybe in a financial position to pay more to eliminate the hassle, but I'mnot.            -- Ken Graham Dayton,Wash.                           Knifepoint Humor                        I read Atul Gawande's"Manning the Hospital Barricades" with interest. I understand hispremise that we should get along, but my comments as a "meddie" will be muchmore parochial.            I agree that surgeonsgenerally work very hard. (The question of whether a lot of what they do isreally necessary or appropriate is debatable, as it is for all specialties.)The "virtue" and responsibility aspect are more problematic. There is thecommon ritual of "medical clearance for surgery," where the "meddie" basicallyblesses the operation and is allowed to share responsibility, despite the factthat the note is rarely read and the recommendations are often ignored.            A less than virtuous practicethat is not unheard of is to hustle the patient of a failing operation out ofthe OR to avoid "dying on the table."            I have a couple of additionsfor your medical jokes (not original). How do you hide something from aninternist (meddie)? Put it under a bandage. How do you hide something from asurgeon? Put it in the patient's chart.            Some of mybest friends are surgeons.            -- Andrew W.
