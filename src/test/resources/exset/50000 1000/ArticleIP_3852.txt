(posted Thursday, Feb.13)                                       GreenCheese and Keynes                        Professor Paul Krugman("The DismalScientist") has done me the honor of another attack, this time for analleged vulgarization of the great British economist John Maynard Keynes.            The odd thing is that Pauland I actually agree, more or less, on the policy question. I favor a lowinterest rate. Paul doesn't say quite as much. But he does concede that it isOK, intellectually speaking, to quarrel with Alan Greenspan's judgment. Thismay be the closest I'll get to having Paul's explicit endorsement on thisimportant issue, and I'll take it with pleasure.            Paul and I also agree thatthe way to get lower interest rates is for the Federal Reserve to cut them.This is what the German central banker Hans Tietmayer always calls, with severedisapproval, "the easy way out." I definitely favor the easy way out when it isavailable.            Our argument begins withPaul's assertion that Keynes had some contrary and different view. Krugmanseems to be saying that Keynes overlooked the importance of monetary policy tothe determination of the interest rate. He writes that Keynes held a "liquiditypreference" theory of the interest rate, according to which, in Krugman'sversion, markets for money and bonds determined the interest rate, withmonetary policy playing no visible role.            This misrepresents Keynes,who understood central-bank powers extremely well. Among other things, Keyneshad wielded those powers himself, for all practical purposes, at the BritishTreasury during World War I. Later, he was a vociferous opponent of tightBritish monetary policy during the 1920s.            Liquidity preference, thoughimportant in Keynes, is not a full theory of the interest rate. It is only atheory of the "demand for money"--of the choice between holding illiquid bondsand liquid cash. In order to get from money demand to a full theory of theinterest rate, you need a theory of money supply. Keynes was well aware ofthis, and his view of the supply situation was more or less the same as Paul'sor mine. The central bank supplies the liquidity (money) that speculatorsdemand. The terms on which it does so, combined with the demand conditions,together determine the interest rate.            Keynes therefore understoodperfectly well that a low interest-rate policy requires an accommodatingcentral bank. If people increase their demand for money, then either interestrates must rise, cutting investment, or transactions must fall, cutting outputand employment--unless the central bank acts. The problem, Keynes wrote, wasthat "people desire the moon"--a perfectly safe place to store their wealth.The solution, in Keynes' own metaphor, is to persuade them that "green cheese"is nearly as good, and to have a green-cheese factory--a centralbank--conveniently at hand.            Now, if Keynes'interest-rate theory is not so easily written off, perhaps we should also lookagain at that paradox of thrift. That argument which holds that the attempt toraise saving will end up lowering national income, because consumption willfall, and with it profits, output, and employment. Was Keynes also right whenhe warned against excessive saving?            Paul shrinks from this view.He wants to maintain the tidy and comfortable belief, beloved by Victorians ofall epochs, that thrift is always a virtue. I know that he also strongly favorsa reduction in the federal budget deficit, precisely because that represents arise in so-called "national savings." Paul agrees that such a rise in nationalsavings might have some tendency to depress the economy, along lines of Keynes'multiplier model. But since--according to Krugman--the Federal Reserve cancontrol output and unemployment, he believes that this tendency is easilyoffset by cuts in interest rates to hold employment steady.            This is Paul's second error,in my view. It is one thing to assume that the Federal Reserve could inprinciple always lower interest rates enough to offset the depressing effectsof tax increases and spending cuts. But, in fact, there is no assurance thatGreenspan and his colleagues have any actual intention of behaving in this way,nor any persuasive evidence that they have done so in the past. Paul'sstatement that this is "simple" and "reasonable" does not make it right.            Paul seems to regard AlanGreenspan as an ideologue who actually does control the unemployment rateaccording to the dictates of some economic theory. Greenspan himself hasrepeatedly denied this, and I believe him. I think that Greenspan is a nimblepolitical figure, no more nor less. That being so, the main reason we have highinterest rates is that the forces favoring them are more powerful than theforces opposed. This, I believe, is the deplorable truth.            In October 1993, recall,Congress took drastic action to raise "national saving" by cutting the expectedfuture budget deficits in half. But the Federal Reserve then raised interestrates, beginning in February 1994, an action rationalized by entirely spuriousfears of inflation. The raising of interest rates went on for 18 months, wasnever fully reversed, and actually raised federal spending on interest paymentsby enough to wipe out a large part of the deficit reductions.            That 1994 experience provedthat one cannot rely on the Federal Reserve to offset the workings of theparadox of thrift. That being so, excess saving is a danger, just as Keyneswarned. Analytically, Keynes' theory is right and Krugman's revision of it isbased on a false premise. And the way to get lower interest rates and moreinvestment and durable consumption spending and lower unemployment, all ofwhich I favor, is not to increase thriftiness or to cut deficits. The essentialthing is to get the Federal Reserve to bring interest rates down.            Paul and do I agree on oneother thing. It is very hard to improve on Keynes, and more people should readhim. When they do so, they will find that parable of the widow's cruse--amarvelous tidbit on the rewards of vigorous consumption spending as opposed toparsimony, niggardliness, and thrift. But, speaking of vulgarity, they ought toknow that this is not from some "old folk tale," as Krugman writes. The sourceis actually the Bible: 1 Kings 17:16. "And the barrel of meal wasted not,neither did the cruse of oil fail."            You'dthink a good Keynesian economist would know that.                           --James K. GalbraithLBJSchool of Public AffairsThe University of Texas at Austin                                       Moneybags                        What a great job of compilingAmerica's top philanthropists in the "Slate 60"! However,there are a couple of things I wanted addressed: Why Paul Mellon is missingfrom the list? And Walter Annenberg? Also, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariridonated $10 million to the Boston University School of Management last year forits new building. That is a big donation from a foreign politician.            No. 113, Alfred Slifka, doesnot belong to a New York City family of real-estate developers and investmentmanagers. Instead, Slifka is a Bostonian who owns Global Petroleum Corp., NewEngland's largest distributor of gasoline.            Hope youcan correct the errors.                           --York Lo                                       Ann Castle's reply:One of the important lessons I've learned since we started the Slate project isto be open to change, especially in an entrepreneurial effort like this one.Another equally important message is that no matter how carefully we try tocraft categories of giving, human behavior refuses to be comprehensivelycategorized. I find that reassuring.            We didn't include the Haririgift because it came from a non-American citizen. There were several very largeones made both in the United States and outside the United States last year. Wemay consider changing that guideline this year, or we may do a feature on giftsfrom non-American citizens to institutions here and abroad.            We also decided to list giftsonly in the years the actual gift was announced, not when payments were made onpreviously announced pledges. This accounts for a number of missing foundationgifts. I did not do a mailing last year to private foundations (or to anyone,for that matter) to compile the list; I've changed that procedure this year. Irelied on what I could find in public sources, and sometimes foundation giftsare not as well-publicized. We were quite open about this in the Introduction to the"Slate 60."            As for the background onSlifka, I took that information straight from a news story. I have learned thatI need to verify everything and that even the most reliable sources areoccasionally wrong.            We willstick with our decision to list gifts as they are announced, and won't listgifts made to create or add to private foundations. Again, we may address thistype of giving in a separate feature. We will only list gifts from a privatefoundation to an actual grantee. We are always looking for ideas of how to makethe "Slate 60" even more useful than it has proved to be so far.                           InDefense of the New York Suburbs                        Attention really should bedrawn to Nicholas Lemann's incredible article on suburban New York, "The Suburbs HaveWon." If I was forced to pick one (and only one) favorite bit, I think Iwould have to go with the equation of Starbucks coffee shops withsophistication--perhaps the single most novel, irreverent idea I've ever readin Slate. (Not that I wouldn't be mighty tempted by Lemann's pining for "aMerchant-Ivory-type movie theater," mind you.) You, of course, are free to divein and pick your own favorite strand of drivel.            Lemann then goes on toexplain that New York has no suburbs that are "truly hip." He doesn't favor uswith a definition of "truly hip," but he is kind enough to drop some clues:"[A] truly hip suburb (no, that's not oxymoronic--go visit West Lake Hills,Texas, or Berkeley or Topanga, Calif.), where there would be leaflets stapledto the telephone poles and vegetarian restaurants and rave clubs, is completelyout of the question in New York." Never having been to either West Lake Hillsor Topanga, I can only go on the little Lemann gives us to grasp what makes aplace "truly hip," but let me go ahead and see if I don't have the wholepicture--uh, upper-class, white, Protestant children with dreadlocks, tattoos,and nascent heroin addictions playing in bad rock bands named after legendary1970s TV sitcoms? Bookstores with lots of Noam Chomsky? Loud, irony-freediscussions of Irony? Burrito delivery? Am I in the ballpark? Close? Well, gee,I guess if that's "truly hip," then suburban New York does come up sorely.            What can I tell you? The NewYork suburbs are largely the product of the migration of white-ethnic Catholic,Jewish, and African-Americans (and now Asian-Americans and Latinos) from thecity of New York. People who were (or are), by and large, at most onegeneration removed from poverty. People who were (or are), as they say, shapedby that experience. If one judges their communities by the standards of middle-and upper-class WASP bohemians from Middle America (Starbucks coffee shops andvegetarian restaurants), yeah, they're going to come up short.            Since Lemann's claim to fameis that he wrote a 408-page book explaining to prep-school-educated liberalsthat many black people used to live in the South, this refusal to address basicsociology is glaring. There are a lot of awful things to be said about suburbanNew York, but Lemann is clearly not the person to make the case for or againsta region of the country he simply does not understand. And, of course, it isn'tall bad.            Take, for instance, oh,food. The food here is really good. Really, really good. Turns out the rest ofAmerica isn't full of bakeries and pizzerias. And 24-hour diners anddelicatessens that cut giant chunks of meat with scary slicing machines. Not tomention the thousands of fine, relatively inexpensive ethnic restaurants. Irealize that Lemann is partial to giant, homogenized chains, but some of us arestill content to eat in independently owned restaurants. I guess we're just notas "sophisticated."            Then there's the matter ofour cultural influence, which is huge (and by no means entirely benign), evenif its full magnitude isn't always appreciated by the NPR crowd. Nassau Countyalone has given the world Eddie Murphy, Howard Stern, Rosie O'Donnell, andJerry Seinfeld--four comedians, who for better or worse, probably shape thecutting edge of our national culture more than Charlotte, N.C.; and Berkeley,Calif.; and Austin, Texas; and all the truly hip suburbs with "a patina ofsophistication" combined.            Lemann'ssilly, misinformed article completely ignores issues of class and ethnicitywhile presenting the giant chain stores of mall America (Borders, Starbucks)and the passing trends of middle America upper-class youth (leaflets ontelephone poles, Anglophile raves) as some sort of ideal. His problem with thesuburbs of New York would seem to be that they have too much New York and notenough suburb. All in all--just a really dumb piece.                           --MichaelLangnas                                       West LakeHills Is Not Hip                        I can't think of a moresophisticated way to begin, so I'll just blurt it out: West Lake Hills, Texas,is in no way, shape, or form a hip suburb, no matter what Nick Lemann says in"The Suburbs HaveWon." I'm from West Lake Hills. I left my parents and brother behind when Imoved five years ago, but I still visit frequently, and I have to tell you,there's not a vegetarian restaurant in sight. A notice for a rave party wouldsend an army of cell-phone-waving parents into the school counselor's officeand church hallways demanding action. (After, of course, said parents learnedwhat a rave party was.)            West LakeHills is a pretty place, lots of wood, stone, and gorgeous views of LakeAustin. The new Albertson's supermarket is great fun to shop in--good coffee,fresh herbs, and reasonably good focaccia bread. But in all that lovely,expensive real estate, there's no edge, no irony, no one dressed in black,even. It's certainly no Berkeley. Which, I suspect, is why my parents stilllive there. It's also why I don't.                           --JenniferBradley                                       Fresh-Brewed Influence                        The oneissue that James J. Cramer avoids in his article "I Had Coffee WithClinton" is the fact that had he not given money to the Democratic NationalCommittee or the president, he would not have had the opportunity to sit nextto the president and discuss his stock-option idea. It's not what he may or maynot have been "shaken down" for that day, but what he paid for the price ofadmission. Access to the president should be for all. Why are someone's ideasmore important than mine because they gave money to the president or hisparty?            -- Joe Strupek                                       Train inVain                        In Jacob Weisberg's review ofCharles Murray's What It Means to Be a Libertarian ("The Other L-Word"),he states, "But if government can't reroute the freight train in a betterdirection, it's hard to see how it can derail it." As an engineer, I feelqualified to point out that rerouting requires new track and a switch (not tomention a new destination) before the train arrives. Derailing can be done witha few common chemicals or tools (remove a short section of rail), or a towstrap and vehicle (simply pull the rail out of line a few inches).            In truth, most government"programs" actually accomplish the opposite of the goals they are intended toachieve. Thus, welfare has created a group of permanent dependents, gun controlhas increased gun-related crime, and the war on drugs has created an immenselyprofitable drug trade. Weisberg incorrectly states the nonaggression principleas "no one can use force against anyone else." The proper statement is, "No onemay initiate force against another." The difference is obvious when consideringself-defense.            Also, in writing aboutLibertarianism: A Primer , by David Boaz, he states that "Boaz's modelfor this is the Internet" and asserts that "[h]e neglects, of course, the factthat the Internet began life as a federal defense project." Granted, theInternet's grandfather was DARPANET. This may be one of the (no more than six)cases where a government project went right. DARPANET was intentionallydesigned as a decentralized network in order to (as much as possible) ensuresurvivability in the event of World War III. The current Internet, stilldecentralized, has become a worldwide threat to authoritarian government, dueto the free exchange of ideas it allows. This explains the recent spate ofgovernmental (and intergovernmental) attacks on the Net.            In all,Weisberg displays an abysmal ignorance of what libertarianism is, and whatlibertarian goals mean to "We, the People." I suggest that he be limited toreviewing official government pronouncements in the future. This may be theonly arena in which he can operate comfortably.                           --Earl Warner                                       ALibertarian Quilt                        Jacob Weisberg has it allwrong in his review of Charles Murray's What It Means to Be aLibertarian . He takes the position that he can state and judge "What is alibertarian?"--as though there were only "one type" of libertarian.            That's no more true thansaying there is only one standard by which you can call yourself a Catholic,Protestant, Jew, black, white, Republican, Democrat, or any other philosophy orrace.            CharlesMurray's view of what it takes to be a libertarian and survive, and hope tohave any impact and success in the current political arena, is far differentand more appropriate than Weisberg's view. Follow Weisberg and you'll be in thesticks by yourself and getting nowhere.                           --Mark Cornell                                       No MoreHot Dogs                        In "The AccidentalTheorist," Paul Krugman demonstrates his penchant for naive economicanalogies, ranging all the way back to the classical argument for free tradethat involved wine- and cheese-producing economies. The fact that he recognizesthat people will fault him on the oversimplification of his economicrepresentations doesn't get him off the hook. The problem with these analogies,and the reason they are not immediately disposed of, is that, like Afrocentristhistorical revisionism, they are so riddled with problems that one hardly knowswhere to begin.            Perhaps we could begin bynoting that the service jobs replacing manufacturing jobs (i.e., selling hotdogs instead of making hot dogs) rarely pull the wages of the manufacturingjobs. In his earlier work he accepts models that don't even make allowance forthe mechanisms of capitalism. Krugman's disdain for evidence is alarming; I canwell hear him telling the hungry to simply eat more hot dogs.            Krugmanasserts his argument through use of psychology, not economic reasoning. Namely,if you don't accept my argument then you are a smug, high-minded sophisticate.He is willing to disregard the growing income inequity in this country(illustrated in my article), among other issues, and practically admits thatchanges in his playful thought experiments would come only after cataclysmicevidence demonstrates otherwise (i.e., when they are useless). Krugman servesonly himself and business concerns like Microsoft (now with its newspin-doctoring arm, Slate) that pamper him.                           --JonathanImboden                                       Address your e-mail tothe editors to slate@msn.com.
