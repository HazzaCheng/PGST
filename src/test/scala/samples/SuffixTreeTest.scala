ScalaTest facilitates different styles of testing by providing traits you can mix
together to get the behavior and syntax you prefer.  A few examples are
included here.  For more information, visit:

http://www.scalatest.org/

One way to use ScalaTest is to help make JUnit or TestNG tests more
clear and concise. Here's an example:
*/

import org.scalatest.FunSuite
import org.scalatest.Matchers._

class SuffixTreeTest extends FunSuite {

  test("An empty list should be empty") {
    List() should be('empty)
    Nil should be('empty)
  }

  test("A non-empty list should not be empty") {
    List(1, 2, 3) should not be ('empty)
    List("fee", "fie", "foe", "fum") should not be ('empty)
  }

  test("A list's length should equal the number of elements it contains") {
    List() should have length (0)
    List(1, 2) should have length (2)
    List("fee", "fie", "foe", "fum") should have length (4)
  }
}
